    <desc lang="en">Secret History documentary telling the inside story of the dynastic tensions that were unleashed when Princess Elizabeth, the future queen, fell in love with Prince Philip. It was felt that Philip was rough and ill-mannered - and with the Second World War still fresh in most people's minds, the royal and political elite disliked his German roots. But following the death of King George VI in 1952, the establishment feared a dynastic coup, with the Queen torn between the two sides. The documentary examines the complexities and frustrations of the royal marriage, as the monarch struggled to reconcile the love of her husband with the suspicions of her family and her government.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Boy A director John Crowley teams with Dirty Pretty Things screenwriter Steven Knight for this topical thriller starring Eric Bana and Rebecca Hall star as two former lovers who encounter danger when they are both assigned to the same defense team in a high-profile terrorism trial. It was a typical morning in London when a powerful bomb exploded in the heart of the city. After the smoke cleared, sole surviving terrorist cell member Farroukh Erdogan (Denis Moschitto) was quickly taken into custody. As preparations for his trial begin, however, the government's plan to use classified evidence to prosecute the suspect leads the Attorney General (Jim Broadbent) to appoint Special Advocate Claudia Simmons-Howe (Hall) to the case. Claudia's unique position as a government-approved defense lawyer ensures that she can review the top-secret evidence, and advocate for full disclosure during the inevitable "closed" session portion of the trial. Once Claudia has reviewed the evidence, however, any communication with the defense team and the defendant himself is strictly forbidden. Later, When Erdogan's lawyer dies just before the trial begins, Claudia's driven ex-lover, attorney Martin Rose (Bana), takes his place. Realizing that their previous affair could jeopardize their involvement with the case, Claudia and Martin vow to keep the relationship a well-guarded secret. In time, however, Martin's exhaustive investigation reveals evidence of a shocking conspiracy that threatens to consume them both. Ciarán Hinds and Julia Stiles also star(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Michael</title>
    <desc lang="en">Traditionally, angels are supposed to have snowy wings, spotless flowing robes and be bathed in heavenly light, but not Michael (John Travolta). With a hairy pot belly, long hair, a cigarette addiction, an insatiable sugar craving and filthy wings, the archangel Michael is anything but angelic looking. His unkempt appearance and the fact that he is found holed up in a ramshackle boarding house in a beat-up Iowa backwater, makes it even harder to believe that he is anything but a bum. Still when the publisher of the National Mirror, the country's top tabloid learns there may be an angel afoot, he sends three reporters out to cover the story. Slightly embittered writer Frank Quinlan (William Hurt) hopes the story will bust him out of his slump. Hapless photographer Huey (Robert Pastorelli) worries that one more botched job will cause publisher Vartan Malt (Bob Hoskins) to take away his one lucrative gig shooting celebrity wonder-dog Sparky. The enigmatic Dorothy (Andie MacDowell) is supposedly an expert on all things angelic. Together the disparate trio travel to Iowa and meet Pansy Millbank (Jean Stapleton) the aged owner of a run-down rooming house who tells them how Michael miraculously saved her from financial ruin. In return, she allows him to stay at her place. Naturally, the reporters want to meet this phenomenon, but they are ill-prepared at what groggily stumps down the stairs to greet them. From the stubble-faced, boxer-short wearing, smouldering mess before them, they learn that all high-ranking angels are allowed 26 Earthly vacations for all eternity. This is Michael's final vacation and he wants to have fun. The reporters only want to get as much publicity as they can from their ethereal visitor and so set off with him to Chicago. Along the way, they have many funny misadventures(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Good Shepherd</title>
    <desc lang="en">One man bears witness to the secret history of America during the Cold War in this drama directed by celebrated actor Robert De Niro. In 1939, Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) is a young man with a bright future ahead of him -- he's a top student at Yale and the protégé of one of the school's leading English professors, Dr. Fredericks (Michael Gambon). But Wilson's life changes dramatically when he's invited to join Yale's powerful secret society, Skull and Bones. Through his Skull and Bones connections, Wilson meets Sam Murach (Alec Baldwin), an mysterious FBI agent who asks Wilson to investigate charges that Fredericks is a Nazi sympathizer working with the German government. Later, at a Skull and Bones party, Wilson is introduced to Clover Russell (Angelina Jolie), the sister of one of his classmates and the daughter of a powerful politician; their one-night stand leaves Clover pregnant, and Wilson must leave the woman he loves, Laura (Tammy Blanchard), to wed Clover and give their child a name. Shortly after their wedding, thanks to his work with Murach, Wilson is invited to join the Office of Strategic Services, a military intelligence organization organized by Bill Sullivan (Robert De Niro), and Wilson accepts. Through World War II, Wilson serves with the OSS, and learns he can trust no one in the game of international espionage, which helps make him little more than a stranger to his wife, his son, and his few friends. As the OSS evolves into the Central Intelligence Agency after the war, Wilson becomes party to America's darkest and most dangerous secrets, and in the wake of the futile Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, Wilson is forced to make a terrible choice between the security of his nation and the safety of his family. Inspired by the true-life story of CIA founder James J. Angleton, The Good Shepherd boasts an impressive supporting cast, including William Hurt, John Turturro, Billy Crudup, Joe Pesci, and Timothy Hutton(n)</desc>

After hearing the news of a film being made about his parents' murderous legacy, Glen sets off for Hollywood, where he promptly brings Chucky and Tiffany back to life. Far from diving into doting fatherhood, Chucky is seriously disappointed in his son's lack of inherent evil and tries his best to impart his vast knowledge of all things malevolent before Glen becomes some sort of do-gooder. Elsewhere, Tiffany finds that she will be played by Jennifer Tilly in their movie and doesn't hesitate to let her son in on their family's most cherished tradition -- killing sprees. Directed by Don Mancini, Seed of Chucky features Brad Dourif returning as the voice of Chucky, while Tilly plays both herself and Tiffany. The offspring of the evil pair, Glen, is voiced by Lord of the Rings star Billy Boyd. Cult film director John Waters also makes an appearance, as does hip-hop artist Redman(n)</desc>

Michael Corvin is a medical student who unexpectedly finds himself in the middle of what appears to be a rumble between two well turned-out street gangs. What Michael doesn't know, is that he has witnessed a skirmish between two deadly underground communities, unknown to the mortal world, who are battling for supremacy - the Death Dealers, a tribe of vampires, and the Lycans, a band of werewolves. Selene is a leading werewolf hunter who learns that the Lycans have plans to capture the human who witnessed their battle. Selene begins following Michael around the city, and finds herself wanting to protect him, but her longing becomes a handicap when he's attacked by Lucian, the leader of the werewolf community, and the man she wants to save has now become a sworn enemy(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This quasi-feminist fantasy adventure is based on a popular Dark Horse comic and is set in a civil-war-torn United States. The year is 2017 and a Nazi-like Congressional Directorate has comandeered the government. The evil CD threatens to wipe out entire cities with Red Ribbon, a manufactured virus derived from HIV. They have already successfully tested it on the city of Topeka, and only Steel Harbor remains free. Therein lives Barb Wire (Pamela Lee), a wild-haired black leather and thigh-high boot-wearing, hog-riding spit-fire bounty-hunter who carries antibodies for Red Ribbon in her DNA. Barb frequently captures her fugitives by posing as a stripper. The only time she blows her cover is when someone dares to call her "babe." Her usual reply is punctuated by a violent act upon the offender. On her latest mission, Barb has captured a rebel fugitive, Krebs, who possesses special contact lenses that can defeat the retinal scanners the CD uses to prevent people from defecting to Canada. The evil regime wants those lenses before Krebs can pass them to Cora, D a former government physician who plans to use them to save thousands of lives.. Barb ends up with the lenses and must choose between selling them or giving them to Cora. Lee (best known for starring in the long-running syndicated show Baywatch) performed many of her own stunts(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Richard Hammond presents this chilly version of Total Wipeout, which sees the contestants wrapping up warm to tackle a snow-covered course with winter-themed obstacles and seasonal challenges. They must manoeuvre themselves past Granny's House, watching out for the angry dog nipping at their ankles and a front door guaranteed to smack them in the face. They then cling onto the ski lift to avoid plunging into the icy waters, before riding the conveyor belt that throws them onto those old Wipeout favourites, the big red balls. Amanda Byram laughs it up at the side of the course.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Thirteen</title>
    <desc lang="en">Prolific production designer and art director Catherine Hardwicke makes her directorial debut with the coming-of-age drama Thirteen. Los Angeles teenager and overachiever Tracy (Evan Rachel Wood) is an excellent student in her seventh grade class and gets along well with her mother, Melanie (Holly Hunter). She fears that she's not cool enough to be friends with Evie (Nikki Reed), the most popular girl in school. Fueled with genuine adolescent energy, Tracy follows Evie's lead into the harsh realities of sex, drugs, and hard-edged adventure. Consumed with temptations and conflicting desires, Tracy loses her good-girl identity, greatly affecting her relationship with her mom. Partly autobiographical, Thirteen was co-written by Hardwicke and actual 13-year-old Reed, who are close family friends. Originally intending to write a teen comedy, they ended up creating a hard-hitting drama exposing the contemporary teenage experience. Thirteen was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival, with Catherine Hardwicke taking home the Director's Award(n)</desc>

One of the people that Gabriella cleans for has a diamond necklace worth several million dollars locked in a safe in a bedroom. Desperate for a quick score to get himself out of debt, Alex sees a opportunity for a lot of fast money and hooks up with Victor (Michael Caine), a career criminal who knows how to open safes but is desperately ill with tuberculosis. Nicholson and Rafelson first worked together on the film Head, starring The Monkees (Nicholson only had a bit part, but he also wrote the screenplay and was credited with producing the soundtrack album)(n)</desc>

Carl and Molly (Matt Dillon and Kate Hudson) are a thirtysomething couple who have just gotten married and are settling down into a cozy new home in a quiet neighborhood. While Carl and Molly are happy with their new digs, Carl's best friend, Randy Dupree (Owen Wilson), is not content with his living arrangements. Dupree has all but made a career out of avoiding work, responsibility, and commitment, and while his charm usually manages to keep him afloat, when he loses his job, his apartment, and his car. Carl can't bear to see Dupree in such dire circumstances, and tells Dupree he can stay on their couch until he can get things straightened out. But while Carl was expecting Dupree to stay for a few days, it soon becomes obvious to both him and Molly that their guest has no intention of moving out anytime soon, and while the likable freeloader starts working his charm on Molly, their neighbors, and their friends, Carl soon finds himself at the end of his rope with his best man and childhood buddy. You, Me and Dupree also stars Amanda Detmer, Seth Rogen, and Michael Douglas as Molly's father(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Whale</title>
    <desc lang="en">Jonas Armstrong stars in this drama about the fateful last voyage of the 19th-century Nantucket whaling ship Essex, which was attacked and sunk by a sperm whale in 1820, leaving the crew struggling to survive in three smaller boats. Stranded in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, the men must decide whether to head for the nearest islands, 1,000 miles downwind to the west, or set out on an epic journey of almost 3,000 miles to reach the South American mainland. Seen through the eyes of 14-year-old cabin boy Thomas Nickerson, the incident went on to inspire Herman Melville's book, Moby-Dick. Newcomer Charles Furness plays the young Nickerson, with West Wing and Apocalypse Now star Martin Sheen as the older man, while the crew includes Paul Kaye, Adam Rayner and Jolyon Coy.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">David Attenborough continues his exploration of the continent in east Africa, which is a haven for life and supports a higher density of large mammals than anywhere else on Earth. From dense forests to snow-capped peaks, steamy swamps to endless savannah, it's also a land of unpredictable extremes, where creatures must adapt to survive. In Tanzania, a tiny lizard risks its life to eat flies from the face of a sleepy lion. The nesting habits of the 4ft shoebill are also captured on camera - the giant bird has two chicks, but due to sibling rivalry only one will survive. On the plains of Amboseli, a baby elephant is near to death in the drought, so its mother leaves the herd to stay with her offspring until the bitter end.(n)</desc>

There, thousands of butterflies dance for the right to mate, while on a tiny island off Mozambique, green turtles emerge from eggs and begin a hazardous journey to the water - with pied crows and hungry crabs eager to get them.

    <desc lang="en">David Attenborough explores the vast and diverse continent, aiming to show its landscapes and wildlife as they have never been seen before. He begins in the Kalahari desert, Africa's south-west corner, where clever meerkats are outsmarted by a wily bird's use of mimicry, a solitary rhino is seen to exhibit previously unknown sociable behaviours, terrifying insects prey on baby birds and the rarest fish in the world is filmed for the first time. In the neighbouring Namib desert, which receives almost no rain, the competition for scant resources can be fierce, as proven by a ferocious fight for supremacy between two giraffes.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">David Attenborough explores the vast and diverse continent, aiming to show its landscapes and wildlife as they have never been seen before. He begins in the Kalahari desert, Africa's south-west corner, where clever meerkats are outsmarted by a wily bird's use of mimicry, a solitary rhino is seen to exhibit previously unknown sociable behaviours, terrifying insects prey on baby birds and the rarest fish in the world is filmed for the first time. In the neighbouring Namib desert, which receives almost no rain, the competition for scant resources can be fierce, as proven by a ferocious fight for supremacy between two giraffes.(n)</desc>

Carlyle (Steve Howey) and his kid brother, Trip (Mike Vogel), are both racers in the rough and tumble world of supercross, a revved-up variation on motocross racing in which specially modified motorcycle negotiate specially built dirt tracks that send riders through tricky twists and turns, over rough terrain, and off high-flying jumps. Both are talented racers, but K.C. has a wilder and more reckless approach, while Trip follows a more cautious path. A more profound difference between them arises when K.C. is offered a lucrative deal to ride for a factory-sponsored team; he takes the deal, and leaves his brother behind to race on his own dime. However, when an accident takes Trip out of the running on the supercross circuit, he and K.C. set aside their differences as Trip helps coach his older brother so he can succeed in his drive to the championship. Made with the cooperation of a leading supercross race promoter, Supercross: The Movie also stars Sophia Bush and Cameron Richardson as the brothers' love interests, and Robert Carradine as a determined race coach(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Gore Verbinski and the crew set sail once again for this, the third chapter in the swashbuckling Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is hopelessly trapped in Davy Jones' locker after a harrowing encounter with the dreaded Kracken, and now Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) must align themselves with the nefarious Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) if they hold out any hope of saving their old friend from a fate worse than death. The East India Trading Company and its fearsome leader, Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), have taken control of the ghostly Flying Dutchman and its captain, Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), and now the baleful Admiral Norrington (Jack Davenport) has taken the helm in a relentless bid to destroy every pirate ship in his path and bring the Age of Piracy to a violent close. Meanwhile, Will, Elizabeth, and Captain Barbossa navigate treacherous waters and face bitter betrayal as they set sail to gather the only army that can stand up to Beckett -- The Nine Lords of the Brethren Court. But Captain Jack Sparrow is one of the lords, and as long as he's stuck in Davy Jones' locker, Beckett and his nefarious armada are sure to emerge victorious. There's still hope, however, if the heroic team that includes Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris), Pintel (Lee Arenberg), and Ragetti (Mackenzie Crook) can reach exotic Singapore and convince vulpine pirate Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat) to provide them with charts and a ship. But even the powerful Brethren Court may need a bit of help from volatile sea goddess Calypso in order to weather the coming storm. With the entire future of the pirate way at stake, everyone will be forced to choose sides while drifting precariously to the edge of the earth for one final, spectacular battle(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">On the Record With Brit Hume</title>
    <desc lang="en">As part of the ongoing ratings war between rival cable services CNN and The Fox News Network, CNN commentator Greta Van Susteren was wooed to the "other network" with promises of a much larger salary and a nightly interview program of her own. That program, On the Record With Greta Van Susteren, debuted on February 4, 2002. While some observers were mildly surprised that Van Susteren, whose politics tended to be left of center, would agree to star on a cable network with a perceived Conservative slant, most of the press attention concerning the new series was focused on Van Susteren's remarkable cosmetic-surgery makeover, which she insisted had been decided upon long before Fox News Network offered her a job. On the Record With Greta Van Susteren was seen on a Monday through Friday basis from 10:00 to 11:00 p.m. EST(n)</desc>

Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) is convinced something has gone wrong with his car one morning, but after stopping at a repair shop, he's told his car is OK -- the thumping he feels is his overworked heart, which is finally pushed over the edge later than day when Mr. Burns (voice of Harry Shearer) threatens to fire him for eating doughnuts while ignoring his work. Homer has a heart attack, and a cardiologist tells him he needs a triple coronary bypass operation; however, Homer doesn't have medical insurance, and simply can't pay the 40,000 dollars the operation would cost. With his options running out, Homer sees a television commercial for semi-qualified surgeon Dr. Nick Riviera (voice of Hank Azaria), who will perform any sort of needed operation for a flat fee of $129.99. Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) is wary of Dr. Riviera's abilities, but Homer decides to go through with the bypass anyway; fortunately for everyone involved, Lisa (voice of Yeardley Smith) did some homework on the procedure before her father went under the knife. "Homer's Triple Bypass" was first aired on December 17, 1992(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Summer Catch</title>
    <desc lang="en">This blend of sports and youthful romantic comedy is from director Michael Tollin, who previously produced the sports drama Varsity Blues (1999). Freddie Prinze Jr. stars as Ryan Dunne, a ballplayer who's spending the summer as a pitcher for the famed, highly prestigious Cape Cod League, a non-professional farm team that has turned out numerous baseball legends. Ryan's under special pressure on a number of fronts. He's the first local boy to earn a slot in the league in years, and his blue-collar status earns him the enmity of a hot-shot college teammate, Eric Van Leemer (Corey Pearson). Although he's backed up by his best friend and team catcher Billy Brubaker (Matthew Lillard), Ryan adds more stress to his life by embarking on an affair with a beautiful, wealthy young Vassar graduate, Tenley Parrish (Jessica Biel), who's spending the summer on the Cape with her parents. Tenley is facing her own crisis as her father (Bruce Davison) pressures her to move to San Francisco and work with her uncle, though she'd rather remain in the East and become an architect. Summer Catch is the third onscreen teaming of Prinze and Lillard, and also stars Brian Dennehy, Wilmer Valderrama, Jason Gedrick, Fred Ward, and Brittany Murphy(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Written by Torch Song Trilogy author Harvey Fierstein (who also provides the voice of the title character), the made-for-cable animated special The Sissy Duckling is a study of what it means to be "a bird of a different feather." Sensitive duckling Elmer is a source of embarrassment for his macho father and an object of ridicule for other ducks his own age. Unable and unwilling to defend himself against bullies, and clearly not a "leader of ducks" like his take-charge dad, Elmer dreams of leaving his pond and going somewhere where he will be appreciated for his intellect and resourcefulness. He finally gets this opportunity, only to make a dramatic return just in time to rescue his father -- and the rest of the flock -- when hunters invade the forest. The Sissy Duckling was first telecast September 14, 1999, on HBO(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Deke DaSilva (Sylvester Stallone) and Matthew Fox (Billy Dee Williams) are New York police officers specially assigned to a special multi-national team dedicated to tracking down terrorist Wulfgar (Rutger Hauer). Wulfgar planted a bomb in a London department store, killing several children and he is now an outcast, hunted by both the police and his fellow gang members. He has extensive plastic surgery and resumes his activities aided by Shakka (Persis Khambutta), a completely psychotic fellow outcast. Soon DaSilva and Wulfgar are engaged in a violent battle of wits as Wulfgar resumes his terrorist activities and threatens New York . This very effective thriller features a chilling performance by Rutger Hauer as the handsome, ruthless cold-blooded killer who charms women into helping him and then kills them. Sylvester Stallone gives an unusually understated emotionally vulnerable performance as a man trying to save lives while he saves his own marriage. The film makes excellent use of New York locales, particularly during a terrifying hijacking of a cable car where Wulfgar coolly decides which of the hostages will live or die(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Produced by Tom Hanks, written by Aaron Sorkin, and directed by Mike Nichols, this adaptation of George Crile III's incendiary bestseller tells the remarkable story of the Texas congressman whose efforts to prevent the Red Army from overtaking Afghanistan eventually led to the collapse of the Soviet Union while simultaneously fueling the rise of radical Islam. In the early 1980s, a hastily assembled army of Afghan "freedom fighters" achieved the remarkable feat of fending off Soviet invaders despite the fact that the odds were overwhelmingly stacked against them. At the time, Texas congressman Charlie Wilson (Hanks) was a key member of the hugely powerful House Appropriations Committee. Illuminated to the specifics of this remarkable war by a high-profile Houston socialite, Wilson spearheaded an effort to provide hundreds of millions of dollars in weapons and training to the Mujahideen with more than a little help from brilliant but prickly CIA operative Gust Avrokotos(n)</desc>

Anderson original by serving as a straight-up sci-fi horror scarefest. The aliens (and a predator) have landed on planet Earth, and small-town America is about to become the scene of an epic interstellar showdown. As these two breeds of cosmic killers clash in the small-town streets Gunnison, CO, the locals are sent running for their lives. From the murky sewers to the rain-soaked streets, Gunnison has become a total bloodbath. Nowhere is safe, especially from the unstoppable new hybrid known as the "predalien." Now, as the once-quiet community of Gunnison is overrun by Aliens, the only hope for humankind is a fierce hunter from the deepest reaches of space. But this predator is far from a benevolent savior of the human race, because he'll kill any man, woman, or child who gets in the way of his mission to destroy every last alien under these stormy Colorado skies(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Hollywoodland</title>
    <desc lang="en">The mysterious and unexpected death of an iconic Hollywood star may be just the tip of an iceberg of scandal in this showbiz drama based on a true story. George Reeves (played by Ben Affleck) was a journeyman actor who had played a small role in Gone With the Wind and appeared onscreen with the likes of James Cagney, Rita Hayworth, and Marlene Dietrich, but his career was not exactly booming when he was cast as comic-book hero Superman in a 1951 B-movie, Superman and the Mole Men. A year later, the producers of the movie launched a syndicated Superman television series with Reeves returning as "The Man of Steel." The show became a major hit, and Reeves was a star at last. However, on June 16, 1959, to the shock of many, Reeves was found dead of a gunshot wound. Police soon declared Reeves' death a suicide and closed the case, but his mother (Lois Smith) refused to believe her son took his own life, and hired Louis Simo (Adrien Brody), a private detective, to find out the truth about her son's passing. Simo found that many Hollywood insiders did not care to cooperate as he researched the Reeves case, but his digging uncovered plenty of evidence suggesting the actor did not take his own life, and he also revealed one of Reeves' deepest secrets -- while he was engaged to marry a pretty young starlet, Leonore Lemmon (Robin Tunney), Reeves was also carrying on an affair with the beautiful Toni Mannix (Diane Lane), the wife of Eddie Mannix (Bob Hoskins), a powerful and ill-tempered executive at MGM. While the producers of Hollywoodland based their story on factual accounts of the investigation into the death of George Reeves, they were denied permission to use the Superman logo and the familiar introduction to the Adventures of Superman television show by the respective copyright holders(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Blast From the Past</title>
    <desc lang="en">In 1962, Calvin Webber (Christopher Walken) was a brilliant but somewhat paranoid scientist living with his Donna Reed-esque wife, Helen (Sissy Spacek), in Los Angeles. In the midst of the Cuban Missile Crisis, a plane crashed into the Webber's yard. Mistaking the blast for "the big one," the Webbers moved into their elaborate bomb shelter to wait out the half-life of radioactive fallout. In the shelter, now a sort of time capsule, Calvin and Helen conceived and raised their son Adam (played as an adult by Brendan Fraser). For 35 years, Adam was raised on Jackie Gleason, Perry Como, and stories about life on the surface. Calvin taught his son about science, baseball, and communists while Mom taught Adam about dancing, good manners, and charming young ladies. Just in time, too, as Adam is sent to the surface to gather supplies and find a wife, preferably a nice, non-mutant girl from Pasadena with which to repopulate the world. Once this "fish out of water" story is set up, the fish, Adam, is set adrift in a sea of supermarkets and adult bookstores, but is soon caught by Eve Rustikov (Alicia Silverstone). Completely lost above ground, Adam enlists Eve's help to navigate his new world and find the supplies on his list. The literally sheltered Adam falls for this bitter, cynical, street-smart woman who grew up in a bleak Los Angeles with little use for love. Living with her gay roommate, Troy (Dave Foley), Eve has had her hopes chipped away by a long line of dead-end jobs and loser boyfriends. When the throwback Adam enters her life with his sunny disposition, seersucker jacket, and joy at seeing the sky, she can't help but fall in love(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A political consultant in the midst of a bitter divorce attempts to delicately divulge the truth about his past relationships to his curious young daughter, who simply won't stop asking questions until she's satisfied with all the answers. Ten-year-old Maya (Abigail Breslin) is heartbroken to see her parents splitting up, but she's determined to find out precisely how it was that mom and dad came together in the first place. When Maya starts questioning her father Will (Ryan Reynolds) about his life before marriage, dad's memories soon drift back to the time when, as a naïve Wisconsin native and aspiring politician hoping to work on the presidential election, he first arrived in New York City. As Will gradually became savvy to the ways of the big city, he gradually developed romantic relationships with three very different women: Emily (Elizabeth Banks) was the girl-next-door that he could always depend on, apolitical April (Isla Fisher) was the best friend and confidante who was always there to listen, and free-spirited journalist Summer (Rachel Weisz) was both beautiful and ambitious. In order to prevent his perceptive little girl from predicting the outcome before his story is told, Will carefully changes the names of his three romantic interests, creating a hopelessly romantic puzzle that highlights both the joys and hardships of true love(n)</desc>

This time around, the shoes have passed into the hands of Tucker Bennett (Shaun Johnston), the son of a seriously ill youngster named Charlie (Angus T. Jones. As fate would have it, Charlie is a student of schoolteacher Meghan (Rebecca Gayheart), who is endeavoring to set up a day-care center for single moms in the small town where she lives. At the same time in the same town, young medical resident Nathan Andrews (Neil Patrick Harris), his self-confidence shattered by the death of a teenage patient on the operating table, has returned home to work in the garage owned by his dad Jack (Shaun Johnston). In due course, Nathan meets Meghan and Charlie, and becomes intimately involved in the trials and tribulations of both, leading to an emotional climax in which Nathan must decide whether or not to summon his dormant medical skills to save Charlie's life. Singers NewSong and Blake Shelton appear as themselves, respectively performing the title song and the new composition "Nobody But Me".

    <desc lang="en">The Time Team presenter's journeys along Britain's oldest trackways concludes as he treads the North Downs Way, which was used by pilgrims, traders, hunters and invaders for 5,000 years. Thought to have been a prehistoric highway linking Britain to the continent, the track was used by Celts and Romans alike, and Tony investigates some of the megaliths, burial sites, ley lines and hidden caves that lie alongside the route. Travelling from the cliffs at Folkestone to Down House in the rolling North Downs, Tony visits one of Britain's oldest oak trees, attends the shrine of Thomas Becket, and uncovers a lost Roman battle site.

    <title lang="en">The Girl Next Door</title>
    <desc lang="en">Boy meets girl who's already met all sorts of boys and girls in this teen-slanted comedy. Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch) is a straight-laced and highly ambitious high school student who plans to study at Georgetown University and dreams of a career in politics. While most of his classmates are in the throes of an epidemic of senioritis, Matthew is obsessed with schoolwork and has a hard time relaxing and having fun. But he finds himself a bit less focused on his future career when Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert), a beautiful 19-year-old blonde, moves in next door. Danielle is playful, spontaneous, and doesn't always remember to draw her shades, and before long Matthew is head over heels in love. Danielle soon finds herself taken with Matthew as well, but their relationship takes an unusual turn when he discovers that, before she moved to town, Danielle had a successful career as a porn actress. Matthew is able to convince Danielle that she's cut out for better things in life than appearing in porn videos, but his advice doesn't especially please Kelly (Timothy Olyphant) or Hugo (James Remar), two porn moguls who figure Matthew owes them big-time after convincing their leading lady to drop out of the adult industry. The Girl Next Door -- which, appropriately enough, shares its title with a 1999 documentary about adult film superstar Stacy Valentine -- also features Timothy Bottoms, Paul Dano, and Chris Marquette(n)</desc>

Finally, the search is on for a lost paraglider - yielding surprising results.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Courtship.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">David Attenborough reveals how the competition to breed creates scenes of the most extraordinary beauty, as well as some of the most violent battles seen in nature. A male flame bowerbird shows off its artistic prowess to impress a potential mate - but if that does not prove enough, it will demonstrate its dancing skills instead. Waved albatrosses pair up for life and spend hours in each other's company, although things are not so simple for a male peacock jumping spider - one wrong move in its dazzling courtship routine could prove fatal. However, one of the most magnificent displays of all is created by a tiny male pufferfish, which impresses the ladies by building a spectacular underwater `crop circle' in the sand - arguably the most perfect and complex structure created by any animal.(n)</desc>

Barrister Martha Costello is now a QC, meaning the cases are bigger and the stakes are higher, as she finds when she defends a gangster accused of blinding a car-wash attendant. It seems like a hopeless brief, as he was found with blood on his shoes and made a confession to the police - and things only get worse when she comes up against the ruthless prosecution lawyer, nicknamed Lady Macbeth for her uncompromising and vicious approach in court. Clive, meanwhile, still smarting from his unsuccessful silk application, takes on a sensitive case with a new solicitor, the fiery and passionate George Duggan, and soon discovers he has more than met his match. Neil Stuke co-stars, with Phil Davis, Indira Varma and Frances Barber joining the cast.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Euro '88 - We Can Beat This Lot</title>
    <desc lang="en">Garry Mac Donncha presents the first of two programmes looking back at Ireland's history in the UEFA European Championships. He revisits the events of November 1987, when Scotland's win against Bulgaria in the qualifying stages of the 1988 tournament meant Ireland were able to progress through to the group stage during their first-ever appearance. What followed was a succession of victories both small and large, but hopes were ultimately dashed when, in the last round of the group stage, champions-to-be the Netherlands defeated the boys in green. Former players Ray Houghton and Ronnie Whelan and RTÉ commentator George Hamilton share their memories of the contest, and what it meant to fans back home.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">As their tour of duty in Iraq draws to a close, four American soldiers learn that they are scheduled to embark on one final, fateful mission that will forever change their concept of war. Shortly after receiving the news that they will soon be reunited with their families back in the United States, a unit serving in Iraq is deployed on a humanitarian mission to deliver medical supplies to a remote Iraqi village. Upon arriving in the village, the unit is viciously ambushed and many lives are lost. Now, as the surviving members of the battalion return home and attempt to readjust to civilian life, the physical injuries and psychological scars sustained during that tragic event continue to take a heavy emotional toll on the war-torn soldiers. Samuel L. Jackson, Jessica Biel, and rapper-turned-actor 50 Cent star in an affecting psychological war drama from Academy Award-winning director Irwin Winkler(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Comic actor Ben Stiller co-wrote, directed, and stars in this spoof of the fashion industry that began as a short skit for the 1996 VH1 Fashion Awards. Stiller is Derek Zoolander, an intellectually challenged but bone structure-blessed male model who's despondent after being eclipsed in popularity by an equally vacuous rival, Hansel (Owen Wilson). Upon his reluctant retirement, Derek is invited to a day spa by previously standoffish fashion designer Jacobim Mugatu (Will Ferrell), where the befuddled model is brainwashed by the mysterious Katinka (Milla Jovovich) into assassinating the prime minister of Malaysia. In addition to Stiller's real-life wife Christine Taylor, Zoolander co-stars his father Jerry Stiller, along with Jon Voight, David Duchovny, Andy Dick, and Fabio(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Big Eyes</title>
    <desc lang="en">The true story of painter Margaret Keane's life in obscurity while her husband gleaned the notoriety for being the face of her work is brought to the screen by Tim Burton and his Ed Wood screenwriters, Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. The story opens in the late 1950s, when Margaret Keane (Amy Adams) packs up the car with her daughter and their personal belongings, and leaves her husband to start a new life in San Francisco. There, Margaret quickly reconnects with her old friend DeeAnn (Krysten Ritter), and falls head over heels for Walter (Christoph Waltz), an artist and part-time real-estate broker who soon shows great interest in her unique paintings of small children with strikingly expressive, saucer-like eyes. Before long, the two are married, and Walter is claiming credit for Margaret's increasingly popular paintings. With the money rolling in, Margaret initially agrees to go along with the ruse, but the closer she gets to her new husband the more she begins to realize that he's little more than a smooth-talking scam artist. Later, riddled with guild over the fact that she's been deceiving her own daughter as her paintings become a pop-culture phenomenon, Margaret leaves the increasingly abusive Walter, and moves to Hawaii. Only then does Margaret gain the confidence to reclaim the works that have been credited to her husband, even when doing so entails going before the judge and proving that she and she alone created the enchanting children with the big eyes. Danny Huston, Terence Stamp, and Jason Schwartzman co-star(n)</desc>

Stiller is Derek Zoolander, an intellectually challenged but bone structure-blessed male model who's despondent after being eclipsed in popularity by an equally vacuous rival, Hansel (Owen Wilson). Upon his reluctant retirement, Derek is invited to a day spa by previously standoffish fashion designer Jacobim Mugatu (Will Ferrell), where the befuddled model is brainwashed by the mysterious Katinka (Milla Jovovich) into assassinating the prime minister of Malaysia. In addition to Stiller's real-life wife Christine Taylor, Zoolander co-stars his father Jerry Stiller, along with Jon Voight, David Duchovny, Andy Dick, and Fabio(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Big Eyes</title>
    <desc lang="en">The true story of painter Margaret Keane's life in obscurity while her husband gleaned the notoriety for being the face of her work is brought to the screen by Tim Burton and his Ed Wood screenwriters, Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. The story opens in the late 1950s, when Margaret Keane (Amy Adams) packs up the car with her daughter and their personal belongings, and leaves her husband to start a new life in San Francisco. There, Margaret quickly reconnects with her old friend DeeAnn (Krysten Ritter), and falls head over heels for Walter (Christoph Waltz), an artist and part-time real-estate broker who soon shows great interest in her unique paintings of small children with strikingly expressive, saucer-like eyes. Before long, the two are married, and Walter is claiming credit for Margaret's increasingly popular paintings. With the money rolling in, Margaret initially agrees to go along with the ruse, but the closer she gets to her new husband the more she begins to realize that he's little more than a smooth-talking scam artist. Later, riddled with guild over the fact that she's been deceiving her own daughter as her paintings become a pop-culture phenomenon, Margaret leaves the increasingly abusive Walter, and moves to Hawaii. Only then does Margaret gain the confidence to reclaim the works that have been credited to her husband, even when doing so entails going before the judge and proving that she and she alone created the enchanting children with the big eyes. Danny Huston, Terence Stamp, and Jason Schwartzman co-star(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Shadow Zone: The Undead Express</title>
    <desc lang="en">A horror semi-parody targeted at the young adult market that ravenously gobbles up horror books like R.L. Stine's Goosebumps series, this made-for-TV vampire tale stars Chauncey Leopardi as Zach, a teenage rebel with a flair for telling ghost stories, who stumbles on an underground cabal of vampires when he takes a fateful ride on a New York subway. The vampire's leader, Valentine (Ron Silver), proposes a deal to young Zach, offering him safe passage to the world above, thus enabling the trapped vampire -- who can only mingle with humanity through the willing assistance of an innocent youth -- to reach the surface as well. Our young hero balks at this idea and escapes to the surface with a wild story for his skeptical pals, who shun him until one of their number is kidnapped by the undead subway dwellers in exchange for Zach's cooperation. Though atmospherically photographed, this low-budget production is a bit too corny to provide either laughs or chills, and it suffers further from lethargic pacing(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Writer Jimmy McGovern's drama based on the UK's controversial joint enterprise law. When 17-year-old Johnjo gives his cousin and his friends a lift in his brother's car, he is unaware they are going to confront a local loudmouth who they feel needs putting in his place. As Johnjo waits in the car, one of them takes offence with an innocent bystander, who is fatally stabbed. The murder victim is the eldest child of Margaret and Tommy Ward, who has become estranged from his family after a bitter divorce. Struggling to make ends meet on her own, Margaret is nevertheless determined to fight through bureaucracy and the cool indifference of the banks to give Thomas the send-off he deserves. Johnjo makes his own way to the police station and lays the blame squarely with Kieran. However, career copper DI Hastings wants everyone possible to be tried for murder, and with the joint enterprise doctrine at his disposal, that includes Johnjo(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Delta Farce</title>
    <desc lang="en">When a hard-luck blue-collar worker and his two best friends are mistaken for Army Reservists by a tough-talking Army sergeant, the plane set to fly them to the front lines of Iraq mistakenly drops them in the middle of Mexico to disastrous results in a freewheeling military comedy starring Larry the Cable Guy, Bill Engvall, and D.J. Qualls. Larry (the Cable Guy) has lost his job and his woman in the short span of 24 hours. Convinced that some suds and target shooting are just the right remedies for a broken, jobless heart, Larry sets out with his next-door neighbor Bill (Engvall) and their trigger-happy pal Everett (Qualls) in order to blast off some rounds and down some brews. Their relaxing weekend soon takes an unexpected turn, however, when hard-case Army sergeant Kilgrove (Keith David) mistakes the trio as slacking Army reservists and loads them in a plane bound for Fallujah. Subsequently air-dropped over Mexico due to pilot error, the clueless, wannabe war heroes become convinced that they're actually in the Middle East and set out to save a rural village from what they assume to be an insurgent uprising. Though the thankful locals champion the noble but dimwitted trio for their heroism, the celebration is short-lived as ruthless warlord Carlos Santana (Danny Trejo) pays a personal visit to the town with a plan to confront the fearless warriors who dared to challenge his iron-fist rule(n)</desc>

(gay best friend). The moment Tanner (Michael J. Willett) reveals his true sexuality to his classmates he rockets up the social ladder. Suddenly, he's decked out in the latest fashions, and living it up with the in-crowd. Meanwhile, the friends who used to be part of Tanner's inner circle get left out in the cold. Now Tanner will be faced with the most difficult decision of his high school career -- keep riding the popularity train and accept his role as a human fashion accessory, or go back to the people who have always accepted him for who he really is.

    <title lang="en">Born on the Fourth of July</title>
    <desc lang="en">The second of three films by co-writer/director Oliver Stone to explore the effects of the Vietnam War (Platoon and Heaven and Earth are the others), Born On The Fourth Of July tells the true story of Ron Kovic (Tom Cruise), a patriotic, All-American small town athlete who shocks his family by enlisting with the Marines to fight in the Vietnam War. Once he is overseas, however, Kovic's gung-ho enthusiasm turns to horror and confusion when he accidentally kills one of his own men in a firefight. His downfall is furthered by a bullet wound that leaves him paralyzed from the chest down. He returns home, spends an appalling, nightmarish stint in a veterans' hospital, and follows an increasingly disillusioned and fragmented path that ultimately leaves him drunk and dissolute in Mexico. However, Kovic somehow turns himself around and pulls his life together, becoming an outspoken anti-war activist in the process. The film is long but emotionally powerful; many consider it Stone's best work and Cruise's best performance. Both were nominated for Oscars, as was the film itself, but only Stone, who co-wrote the film with Kovic from the latter's book, won for Best Director(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In 'Brooklyn's Finest', we're taken on a dark ride through the streets of Brooklyn, following three New York Police officers as they wrestle with temptation while attempting to uphold the law and deal with the pressures of the job. Eddie (Richard Gere) is a bitter and disillusioned veteran cop who's a week away from retirement. Tango (Don Cheadle) is an undercover narcotics cop who tries desperately to leave the streets and earn a promotion to a desk job. Much like Eddie, he's lost sight of his priorities and his loyalties seem to lie more with notorious inner-city drug dealer Caz (Wesley Snipes) than with the boys in blue. At the same time, narcotics detective Sal is a family man in despair and needs to raise money to buy a better house for his family. In seven days, the lives of all three officers will converge at one crime scene(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In 'Brooklyn's Finest', we're taken on a dark ride through the streets of Brooklyn, following three New York Police officers as they wrestle with temptation while attempting to uphold the law and deal with the pressures of the job. Eddie (Richard Gere) is a bitter and disillusioned veteran cop who's a week away from retirement. Tango (Don Cheadle) is an undercover narcotics cop who tries desperately to leave the streets and earn a promotion to a desk job. Much like Eddie, he's lost sight of his priorities and his loyalties seem to lie more with notorious inner-city drug dealer Caz (Wesley Snipes) than with the boys in blue. At the same time, narcotics detective Sal is a family man in despair and needs to raise money to buy a better house for his family. In seven days, the lives of all three officers will converge at one crime scene(n)</desc>

A bully to his teenage daughter Rachel (Mikki Allen), Henry also cheats on his wife Sarah (Annette Bening) and treats everyone from the maid to his assistant with cruel selfishness. Stepping out to a local mini-market for a pack of cigarettes late one night, Henry accidentally interrupts a burglary and is shot in the head by a stick-up artist. After a long coma, Henry survives only to find that he has no memory and must re-learn everything from reading to tying his shoes. Reborn as a friendly, childlike innocent, Henry charms his therapist (Bill Nunn) and reconnects with his wife and daughter, only to uncover some secrets about how truly appalling he once was(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Snow Dogs</title>
    <desc lang="en">Two Oscar-winning actors add a family-oriented comedy to their resumes with this Disney-produced arctic adventure. Snow Dogs stars Cuba Gooding Jr. as Ted Brooks, a Florida-dwelling dentist with a successful chain of offices and a comfy, poolside lifestyle. All this changes, however, when he finds out that he was actually adopted as a child, and that his birth mother has died and left him an inheritance in her home state of Alaska, of all places. After arriving in the snow-bound clime, Ted learns that he has been willed a pack of cutely named sled dogs: Demon, Diesel, Dutchess, Nana, Mack, Scooper, Sniff, and Yodel. Problem is, the town's premiere sled-dogger, Thunder Jack (James Coburn), wants the pack for himself, and encourages Ted to go back to his tropical environs. But with a major sled-dog race looming, Ted's inspired to learn the ropes, as it were, and prove himself worthy of his birth mother's inheritance -- any way he can. Snow Dogs was directed by Jingle All the Way's Brian Levant and features some animatronic dog effects by Jim Henson's Creature Shop; the script was very loosely adapted from popular author Gary Paulsen's nonfiction book Winterdance: The Fine Madness of Running the Iditarod(n)</desc>

Dean Jagger stars as Ed Lindsay, a cranky middle-aged man living in a boarding house with several other old-timers, including his former fiancée Vinnie Brown (Carmen Mathews). Fed up with television, Ed squirrels himself away in his room, where he begins tooling around with the antique radio he's found in the cellar. Before long, he is receiving broadcasts from the 1930s and 1940s -- live broadcasts, not reruns. Having opened a window to the past, Ed desperately tries to correct several mistakes he's made in life. Scripted by Charles Beaumont from a story by OCee Ritch, "Static" was one of six videotaped Twilight Zone episodes and was originally telecast March 10, 1961 (and yes, that voice emanating from Ed's old-time radio does belong to future Hogan's Heroes star Bob Crane)(n)</desc>

Upon taking control of the government, Clemente summons forth the man he has deposed, General DeCruz (Will Kuluva). Gloating, Clemente asks DeCruz if he has anything to say before he is executed. With a sly smile, DeCruz directs Clemente's attention to a huge mirror in the presidential palace, informing Clemente that the mirror will reveal the faces of those who will ultimately destroy him. He's right, of course, and any viewer who can't see the ending coming a mile away deserves to be drummed out of the living room in disgrace. Written by Rod Serling, "The Mirror" was originally telecast October 26, 1961(n)</desc>

Originally filmed for Twilight Zone's second season, writer-director Montgomery Pittman's "The Grave" was not telecast until Season Three -- to be exact, October 27, 1961. Lee Marvin stars as western gunslinger Conny Miller, who upon arriving in a flea-bitten town for a showdown with outlaw Pinto Sykes, is told that Sykes is already dead. Convinced that Miller is a coward who never really wanted to catch up with him, the dying Sykes had challenged Miller to visit his grave, warning that he would reach up from the ground and drag Miller in with him. Goaded by the townspeople, the terrified Miller ventures into the graveyard in the dead of night. Western-movie regulars Strother Martin and Lee Van Cleef appear in key supporting roles(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">It's a Good Life</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">It's a Good Life. Adapted by Rod Serling from a story by Jerome Bixby, "It's a Good Life" stands the test of time as one of the best-ever Twilight Zone episodes -- not to mention one of the series' most frightening efforts. The terrified citizens of Peaksville, Ohio, are held in thrall by a "monster" in the form of angelic-looking youngster Anthony Fremont (Billy Mumy). Possessed with the ability to read minds, coupled with mysterious destructive powers, Anthony bristles whenever he senses that someone is thinking bad thoughts -- and whenever he bristles, something really bad happens (yes, this is the one with the cornfield and the jack-in-the-box). Understandably, this episode has always been a favorite of youngsters, who would give anything to wield Anthony Fremont's awesome powers over their own parents. First telecast November 3, 1961, "It's a Good Life" was later reworked in the 1983 theatrical film Twilight Zone: The Movie -- and a few years after that, it was delightfully lampooned on one of The Simpsons' "Treehouse of Horror" episodes(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Grave. Originally filmed for Twilight Zone's second season, writer-director Montgomery Pittman's "The Grave" was not telecast until Season Three -- to be exact, October 27, 1961. Lee Marvin stars as western gunslinger Conny Miller, who upon arriving in a flea-bitten town for a showdown with outlaw Pinto Sykes, is told that Sykes is already dead. Convinced that Miller is a coward who never really wanted to catch up with him, the dying Sykes had challenged Miller to visit his grave, warning that he would reach up from the ground and drag Miller in with him. Goaded by the townspeople, the terrified Miller ventures into the graveyard in the dead of night. Western-movie regulars Strother Martin and Lee Van Cleef appear in key supporting roles(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">It's a Good Life</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">It's a Good Life. Adapted by Rod Serling from a story by Jerome Bixby, "It's a Good Life" stands the test of time as one of the best-ever Twilight Zone episodes -- not to mention one of the series' most frightening efforts. The terrified citizens of Peaksville, Ohio, are held in thrall by a "monster" in the form of angelic-looking youngster Anthony Fremont (Billy Mumy). Possessed with the ability to read minds, coupled with mysterious destructive powers, Anthony bristles whenever he senses that someone is thinking bad thoughts -- and whenever he bristles, something really bad happens (yes, this is the one with the cornfield and the jack-in-the-box). Understandably, this episode has always been a favorite of youngsters, who would give anything to wield Anthony Fremont's awesome powers over their own parents. First telecast November 3, 1961, "It's a Good Life" was later reworked in the 1983 theatrical film Twilight Zone: The Movie -- and a few years after that, it was delightfully lampooned on one of The Simpsons' "Treehouse of Horror" episodes(n)</desc>

Elsewhere on the romantic scene, Monica (Courteney Cox) and Chandler (Matthew Perry), upon returning to New York, decide to move in together, even though (unlike Ross and Rachel) their planned Vegas wedding never came off. And poor Joey (Matt LeBlanc) is also back in town, his latest "big break" in show business having blown up in his face, obliging him to head back to the Big Apple with feckless Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) at the wheel.

    <desc lang="en">(1972) Father Ted Night is rounded off by the influential American film The Heartbreak Kid , starring Charles Grodin, Jeannie Berlin and Cybill Shepherd, which both Graham Linehan and Arthur Mathews cite as a major influence on their comedy writing. Elaine May's romantic tragic-comedy stars Grodin as Lenny Cantrow, newly married to Lila (Berlin). En route to their honeymoon in Miami, he's already beginning to have second doubts after seeing her eat an egg mayo sandwich and hearing her sing the same song over again. At the resort, disaster strikes when Lila gets sunburnt and is confined to their room. Lenny, alone on the beach, suddenly spies Kelly Corcoran (Shepherd) and falls for her on the spot. Dumping Lila, he pursues Kelly to her home in Minnesota and wins her heart. But he soon learns that not everything beautiful is perfect and that people are not just commodities to be cast aside on a whim. Premiere(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A group of former government assassins fights back against the CIA after they're targeted for knowing too much in this adaptation of Warren Ellis' acclaimed DC Comics graphic novels. Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) used to be a hired gun for the CIA. Along with Joe (Morgan Freeman), Marvin (John Malkovich), and Victoria (Helen Mirren), Frank's specialty was carrying out contracts that the government didn't want the public to know about. These days, Frank and his old gang are all retired, but the powers that be are still concerned that they know too much, and dispatch a team of top assassins to ensure their silence. Now, Frank and his former team members realize that their only hope for survival is to break into CIA headquarters and expose the truth. But once they're in, the group uncovers evidence of a massive cover-up that promises to rock the very foundation of our government. Karl Urban, Brian Cox, Richard Dreyfuss, and Ernest Borgnine co-star(n)</desc>
