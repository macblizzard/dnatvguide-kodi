Preacher's shady past is implied when he first comes into town and keeps his anonymity intact. He is sheltered by an unmarried duo, Hull and Sarah (Michael Moriarty and Carrie Snodgress), and soon pays them back by saving Hull from a few murderous thugs. Caught in the middle of the growing conflict, Preacher rallies the miners into a combative group and then goes on to final showdown in true "high noon" style(n)</desc>

Fish has spent the past two decades languishing at soul-crushing day jobs while his old bandmates became legends, continuing to grace magazine covers and dominate the radio. He might just get another chance at musical success, however, when his teenage cousin invites him to drum for his high school garage band, and they end up catching the ear of record executives. Now, Fish is determined to live the hedonistic rock &amp; roll lifestyle he missed out on 20 years ago, but his new bandmates don't appreciate his hard partying -- and neither do his middle-aged knees.

Shawn Levy (Night at the Museum) and Tom McNulty co-produced the feature, which was penned by Wallace Wolodarsky and Maya Forbes, and directed by Peter Cattaneo (Opal Dream)(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Terminator</title>
    <desc lang="en">Endlessly imitated, The Terminator made the reputation of cowriter/director James Cameron -- who would go on to make 1997's titanic Titanic -- and solidified the stardom of Arnold Schwarzenegger. The movie begins in a post-apocalyptic 2029, when Los Angeles has been largely reduced to rubble and is under the thumb of all-powerful ruling machines. Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), a member of the human resistance movement, is teleported back to 1984. His purpose: to rescue Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), the mother of the man who will lead the 21st-century rebels against the tyrannical machines, from being assassinated before she can give birth. Likewise thrust back to 1984 is The Terminator (Schwarzenegger), a grim, well-armed, virtually indestructable cyborg who has been programmed to eliminate Sarah Connor. After killing two "Sarah Connors" who turn out to be the wrong women, he finally aims his gunsights at the genuine article. This is the film in which Schwarzenegger declared "I'll be baaaack" -- and back he was, in "kinder and gentler" form, in the even more successful Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)(n)</desc>

From a nexus deep within the Justice Department's elite Precrime Unit, all the evidence to convict - from imagery alluding to the time, place and other details - is seen by Pre-Cogs, three psychic beings whose visions of murder have never been wrong. It is the nation's most advanced crime force, a perfect system. And no-one works harder for Precrime than its top man, Chief John Anderton. Destroyed by a tragic loss, Anderton has thrown all of his passion into a system that could potentially spare thousands of people from the tragedy he lived through. Six years later, the coming vote to take it national has only fuelled his conviction that Precrime works. Anderton has no reason to doubt it... until he becomes its #1 suspect(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Restoration Man</title>
    <desc lang="en">George Clarke returns to Harrogate, North Yorkshire, to check on the progress of Carol and Majid Nadry, who after 25 years living in a bungalow, embarked on an ambitious midlife adventure - buying a water tower to turn into a five-storey home. After huge delays and eye-watering legal costs, the couple have finally built the two-storey extension that was the key to creating a family home with character. George sees how the industrial heritage of this unique building is beautifully complemented by a 21st-century glass and sheet-metal extension that finally realises the old water tower's hidden potential.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In June 1985, TWA flight 847 made a routine stop-off in Athens, Greece. Its destination was Rome, but that changed after armed Lebanese militia boarded the plane. Against the backdrop of the Middle East conflict, the terrorists had one objective in mind - the release of hundreds of Islamic prisoners detained in Israel. Seizing the US airliner shortly after take-off, the passengers and crew - including singer Demis Roussos - endured a three-day ordeal involving a stream of landings across various airports. This documentary recalls their experiences.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Daredevil</title>
    <desc lang="en">Mark Steven Johnson's violent superhero fantasy-morality play stars Ben Affleck as Matt Murdock, a guilt-wracked blind vigilante with a penchant for red leather. During his childhood, an accident involving toxic waste blinded Murdock, but it also enhanced his other senses and gave him a kind of 'radar vision'. The incident was partially caused by his discovery that his father was involved with the Mob. Now, the adult Murdock, spurred partly by Catholic guilt over his role in his father's death, has dedicated this life to fighting crime and protecting the innocent. By day Murdock's a defence lawyer, but by night he dispenses summary justice to criminals who've escaped the courts. Things get complicated when he falls in love with Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner). Not only is she the daughter of a man with connections to New York crime bosses but, unknown to Murdock, she's also a vigilante who's equally keen on figure-hugging leather (black in her case). And when Daredevil is framed for the murder of her father, Elektra swears vengeance on the masked crime-fighter (not realising that he's her lover). Meanwhile, both of them are in mortal danger from the actual killer, a merciless Irish assassin called Bullseye (Colin Farrell)(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Daredevil</title>
    <desc lang="en">Mark Steven Johnson's violent superhero fantasy-morality play stars Ben Affleck as Matt Murdock, a guilt-wracked blind vigilante with a penchant for red leather. During his childhood, an accident involving toxic waste blinded Murdock, but it also enhanced his other senses and gave him a kind of 'radar vision'. The incident was partially caused by his discovery that his father was involved with the Mob. Now, the adult Murdock, spurred partly by Catholic guilt over his role in his father's death, has dedicated this life to fighting crime and protecting the innocent. By day Murdock's a defence lawyer, but by night he dispenses summary justice to criminals who've escaped the courts. Things get complicated when he falls in love with Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner). Not only is she the daughter of a man with connections to New York crime bosses but, unknown to Murdock, she's also a vigilante who's equally keen on figure-hugging leather (black in her case). And when Daredevil is framed for the murder of her father, Elektra swears vengeance on the masked crime-fighter (not realising that he's her lover). Meanwhile, both of them are in mortal danger from the actual killer, a merciless Irish assassin called Bullseye (Colin Farrell)(n)</desc>

He dutifully predicts the next day's results for her, as well as unseasonal weather, along with the unwelcome, unsettling news that she will die in a week's time. So far, so dismissible - until the scores come in, together with an unexpected hail storm, leaving Lanie with some serious thinking to do about what she wants from (her apparently foreshortened) life and her relationships..(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Horizon: What on Earth Is Wrong with Gravity?.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Physicist Dr Brian Cox tries to solve the centuries-old mystery of gravity. Unconventionally competing with Newton and Einstein, he starts in Texas, firing a laser at the moon, before moving on to a sat-nav in Denver and a Louisiana swamp. The real issues are in the area of quantum physics for, as he discovers, that is the science of absolutely everything.(n)</desc>

Katie (Jemma Dellender) was a small town model with big city dreams when she arrived in the Big Apple determined to launch her career. Spotting a flyer that tempts her with a free photo shoot, Katie takes the number and makes the call. But when the cameras stop flashing, the nightmare begins. Abducted, tortured, raped, and left for dead, Katie should never have survived the atrocities committed against her. Yet she did, and now as her attackers gasp for their last precious breaths while staring into her cold vengeful eyes, they will finally know the true meaning of fear(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Gore Verbinski and the crew set sail once again for this, the third chapter in the swashbuckling Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is hopelessly trapped in Davy Jones' locker after a harrowing encounter with the dreaded Kracken, and now Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) must align themselves with the nefarious Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) if they hold out any hope of saving their old friend from a fate worse than death. The East India Trading Company and its fearsome leader, Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), have taken control of the ghostly Flying Dutchman and its captain, Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), and now the baleful Admiral Norrington (Jack Davenport) has taken the helm in a relentless bid to destroy every pirate ship in his path and bring the Age of Piracy to a violent close. Meanwhile, Will, Elizabeth, and Captain Barbossa navigate treacherous waters and face bitter betrayal as they set sail to gather the only army that can stand up to Beckett -- The Nine Lords of the Brethren Court. But Captain Jack Sparrow is one of the lords, and as long as he's stuck in Davy Jones' locker, Beckett and his nefarious armada are sure to emerge victorious. There's still hope, however, if the heroic team that includes Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris), Pintel (Lee Arenberg), and Ragetti (Mackenzie Crook) can reach exotic Singapore and convince vulpine pirate Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat) to provide them with charts and a ship. But even the powerful Brethren Court may need a bit of help from volatile sea goddess Calypso in order to weather the coming storm. With the entire future of the pirate way at stake, everyone will be forced to choose sides while drifting precariously to the edge of the earth for one final, spectacular battle(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A surreal crime drama told as only Jim Jarmusch could, Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai stars Forest Whitaker as Ghost Dog, a hit man living in an unidentified but run-down city in what license plates call "The Industrialized State." Known for his gift of being able to come and go without people noticing him, Ghost Dog is a self-taught samurai who is obsessed with order and his strict personal moral code, drawn from the philosophies of the Japanese warriors. As every samurai needs a leader to whom he swears loyalty, Ghost Dog has devoted himself the service of Louie (John Tormey), a low-level crime boss who once saved his life. When Louie's superiors decide he must be executed, Ghost Dog leaps into action, methodically wiping out his many enemies. Along with a dizzying series of stylized shoot-outs, Ghost Dog also features carrier pigeons, characters who read Rashomon, a French-speaking ice cream man, and a score by RZA from the top-selling hip-hop group Wu-Tang Clan, who have their own well-documented obsession with Asian culture. Ghost Dog was screened in competition at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">After sandblasting away years of camp and bad scripts from the Gamera franchise to form a couple of tight-scripted, vastly entertaining flicks, Shusuke Kaneko gives the same treatment to the granddaddy of kaiju eiga characters: Godzilla. The film opens with Godzilla waking up from his underwater hideaway. Unseen since his 1954 attack on Tokyo, the monster is spotted by a Japanese submarine. Though government officials seem reluctant to confront the problem, Navy Admiral Tachibana (Ryudo Uzaki), who witnessed the rampage when he was a child, is more than a little alarmed. Meanwhile, Tachibana's daughter Yuri (Chiharu Niiyama), who works at a struggling TV station, is making a documentary in the mountains of Niigata Prefecture. One night, they experience a massive earthquake and that next morning they learn that a gang of motorcycle punks were crushed in a mountain tunnel and witnesses reportedly saw some sort of fire-breathing creature in the rubble. Later, a group of campers in southern Kagoshima prefecture are crushed by some Thing that crawled out of Lake Ikeda. Soon Japan is awash with monsters -- including Baradon, a monster that looks like a pug terrier with Mickey Mouse ears, and King Gidora, a three-headed beast with a lethal 50-meter tail -- busting up things north, south, east, and west(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The youngest child of the family often has the most problems -- so why should things be different for the Prince of Darkness and his offspring? Satan (Harvey Keitel) is considering retirement, and is pondering which of his sons should take over the family business -- ambitious Adrian (Rhys Ifans), strapping Cassius (Tommy "Tiny" Lister Jr.), or Nicky (Adam Sandler), an accident-prone demon who prefers to stay in his room playing his favorite heavy metal tunes. When Satan decides to stay on for another 10,000 years, Adrian is outraged, and leaves Hell to go to New York, where he and Cassius attempt to round up enough souls to vote Satan out of power. Satan, understandably upset, sends Nicky to bring Adrian and Cassius back home, but Nicky finds life on Earth is more complicated than he expected. Things don't get any easier when he develops a crush on Valerie (Patricia Arquette), a good-hearted mortal woman. Little Nicky also features Michael McKean as a city official trying to put Nicky behind bars, Kevin Nealon as Hell's gatekeeper, Rodney Dangerfield as Satan's father, Robert Smigel as the voice of Beefy -- a talking dog who is Nicky's guide on earth, Allen Covert as Todd -- Nicky's new roommate, and Peter Dante and Jonathan Loughran as a pair of metalheads who dig Satan. Jon Lovitz and Reese Witherspoon play cameo roles, and Regis Philbin and Ozzy Osbourne appear as themselves(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Kirsten Sheridan's family drama stars Freddie Highmore as Evan Taylor, a musical prodigy searching for his parents. When pregnant cellist Lyla Novacek was hit by a car, her controlling father and manager told her she'd lost the baby; in reality she gave birth prematurely and her father sent the infant to an orphanage. Eleven years later, when Evan finds out that his parents are alive, he sets out to find them, taking inspiration from the music around him. The heart of the film is Evan's almost mystical ability to 'feel' music, a challenging concept that is rendered believable thanks to inventive work from the composer of the main score, Mark Mancina. Also starring Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Evan's rock singer father, and Robin Williams as a modern-day Fagin who Evan meets during his search for his family(n)</desc>

Witwicky is being hunted down by the Decepticons, who recognise that he is the main impediment to them gaining control of an awesome source of energy.

Satan (Harvey Keitel) is considering retirement, and is pondering which of his sons should take over the family business -- ambitious Adrian (Rhys Ifans), strapping Cassius (Tommy "Tiny" Lister Jr.), or Nicky (Adam Sandler), an accident-prone demon who prefers to stay in his room playing his favorite heavy metal tunes. When Satan decides to stay on for another 10,000 years, Adrian is outraged, and leaves Hell to go to New York, where he and Cassius attempt to round up enough souls to vote Satan out of power.

    <desc lang="en">Kirsten Sheridan's family drama stars Freddie Highmore as Evan Taylor, a musical prodigy searching for his parents. When pregnant cellist Lyla Novacek was hit by a car, her controlling father and manager told her she'd lost the baby; in reality she gave birth prematurely and her father sent the infant to an orphanage. Eleven years later, when Evan finds out that his parents are alive, he sets out to find them, taking inspiration from the music around him. The heart of the film is Evan's almost mystical ability to 'feel' music, a challenging concept that is rendered believable thanks to inventive work from the composer of the main score, Mark Mancina. Also starring Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Evan's rock singer father, and Robin Williams as a modern-day Fagin who Evan meets during his search for his family(n)</desc>

Witwicky is being hunted down by the Decepticons, who recognise that he is the main impediment to them gaining control of an awesome source of energy. As the Decepticons' plan would result in the destruction of the sun, mankind's fate rests on the shoulders (and in the ingenuity) of our oddly named hero... Edited for language and violence(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Rushmore</title>
    <desc lang="en">After the highly acclaimed independent film Bottle Rocket, director Wes Anderson followed up with a quirky Touchstone Studios film entitled Rushmore. Written by Anderson and friend Owen Wilson (an actor in Armageddon and Anaconda), they created the story of Max Fischer, a highly eccentric 15-year-old boy who attends the tenth grade at Rushmore Academy. Played by Jason Schwartzman (Talia Shire's son and Francis Ford Coppola's nephew), Max is a poor student with big dreams and a love of extracurricular activities. Max is editor of the school newspaper and yearbook, president of the chess, astronomy, French, and German clubs, captain of the fencing team, and director of the school play. Max is also a compulsive liar, telling everyone that his barber father (Seymour Cassel) is really a brain surgeon. Suddenly Max falls in love with Miss Cross (Olivia Williams), a first-grade teacher at the school. He also makes a new friend in business tycoon Mr. Blume (Bill Murray), an eccentric millionaire who also loves Miss Cross. The love triangle heats up as Max refuses to believe that his age has anything to do with Miss Cross refusing his romantic advances. Also Max's scheme to erect an aquarium on the school baseball diamond gets him booted out of Rushmore Academy. As his life crumbles around him, he is forced to grow up and accept the consequences of his actions and his lies. He throws himself more into his extracurricular activities, hoping to redeem himself by staging the most ambitious school play ever attempted(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Rushmore</title>
    <desc lang="en">After the highly acclaimed independent film Bottle Rocket, director Wes Anderson followed up with a quirky Touchstone Studios film entitled Rushmore. Written by Anderson and friend Owen Wilson (an actor in Armageddon and Anaconda), they created the story of Max Fischer, a highly eccentric 15-year-old boy who attends the tenth grade at Rushmore Academy. Played by Jason Schwartzman (Talia Shire's son and Francis Ford Coppola's nephew), Max is a poor student with big dreams and a love of extracurricular activities. Max is editor of the school newspaper and yearbook, president of the chess, astronomy, French, and German clubs, captain of the fencing team, and director of the school play. Max is also a compulsive liar, telling everyone that his barber father (Seymour Cassel) is really a brain surgeon. Suddenly Max falls in love with Miss Cross (Olivia Williams), a first-grade teacher at the school. He also makes a new friend in business tycoon Mr. Blume (Bill Murray), an eccentric millionaire who also loves Miss Cross. The love triangle heats up as Max refuses to believe that his age has anything to do with Miss Cross refusing his romantic advances. Also Max's scheme to erect an aquarium on the school baseball diamond gets him booted out of Rushmore Academy. As his life crumbles around him, he is forced to grow up and accept the consequences of his actions and his lies. He throws himself more into his extracurricular activities, hoping to redeem himself by staging the most ambitious school play ever attempted(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Forgetting Sarah Marshall</title>
    <desc lang="en">In desperate need of a vacation after being unceremoniously dumped by his TV-star girlfriend, a man travels to a lavish Hawaiian resort to nurse his wounds and forget his heartache, only to discover that his ex and her handsome new boyfriend are currently staying at the exact same island hot spot. Peter Bretter (Jason Segel) may be just another struggling musician, but for the past six years he's been dating Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell), one of the hottest stars on television. Sarah is everything in the world to Peter, so when she kindly but firmly tells him that they should each go their separate ways, he is absolutely devastated. Later, after attempting to salvage his ego by awkwardly attempting to become a womanizer and nearly losing his job because of a nervous breakdown, an emotionally fragile Peter attempts to put the past behind him by escaping to the sun-soaked beaches of Oahu. While at first it seems as if Peter has discovered the perfect prescription for a bad case of lost love, his plan soon turns to dust when Sarah and her new rock-star boyfriend, Aldous (Russell Brand), turn up at the exact same resort. Though accepting Sarah's lavish new lifestyle won't be easy for the crestfallen Peter, the laid-back companionship of flirtatious resort employee Rachel (Mila Kunis) -- not to mention a continuous regimen of fruity cocktails -- goes a long way in mending the wounds of a broken heart. Forgetting Sarah Marshall was penned by Segel and produced by Judd Apatow. Fun with Dick and Jane screenwriter Nicholas Stoller makes his directorial debut. The cast also includes Paul Rudd, Bill Hader, Jack McBrayer, and Jonah Hill(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">King Ralph</title>
    <desc lang="en">Sometimes a family title, among the nobility of England, goes to the "collateral" heirs -- people not in the direct line of decent, like cousins, great-nephews and the like. On rare occasions, these people are not even aware that they are about to be elevated to the House of Lords, and they have been living more-or-less ordinary lives. In this comedy, the family which lacks direct heirs is the Royal Family of England -- as all of the likely heirs have died one after the other in swift succession. In this comedy, the "collateral heir" is an exuberant, fence-busting All-American slob (and pretty good rock n' roll musician) by the name of Ralph (John Goodman). Unknown to him, his grandmother had an affair with a royal prince. Ralph's a good guy, and eager to please. He recognizes the importance of the royal hoopla to England and works very hard to fit in as its new designated king. He is assisted by the ever-unctuous, very serious family factotum Willingham (Peter O'Toole). The trouble is, he doesn't have instincts for politics English-style, and he is constantly "putting a foot wrong," as they might say. The most difficult situation for him is when he develops a new love interest, and she's not "acceptable" to the upper crust. In addition to being hounded by the tabloids, he finds that "the good of the state" requires that he drop his new girlfriend. Things really come to a head just before Ralph's coronation as king. Reviewers generally loathed this feel-good comedy, but audiences seem to have enjoyed it tremendously, and it has done well in video and TV airings(n)</desc>

Of course, both the major and his pint-sized recruits have something to teach one another. Payne teaches them the value of self-discipline and instills self-confidence in them, and the recruits teach him to stop and smell the roses (not to mention the fact that kids sometimes need coddling rather than screaming). And, of course, there is the annual JROTC statewide competition, which the kids are obligated to win before the movie can end. While there are some funny moments (the major's exhibition in full-dress whites at a school dance, for example), the script seems too color-by-numbers to be interesting to anyone other than undiscriminating younger viewers(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">MacArthur</title>
    <desc lang="en">Star Gregory Peck went into MacArthur disliking the title character that he was slated to play, but emerged from the experience with a deeper understanding and respect for this complex historical figure. The film is framed in flashback, with an octogenarian General Douglas MacArthur (Peck) making his final address before his alma mater of West Point. We flash back to the fall of Corregidor in 1942, with MacArthur promising "I shall return" to the beleaguered (and eventually imprisoned) American and Filipino troops. The story follows MacArthur's subsequent victories in the South Pacific, occasionally pausing to show us the General's omnipresent sense of "showmanship" (e.g. his wading ashore on the beaches of the Philippines for the benefit of the newsreel cameras). The greater part of the film involves MacArthur's attempts to restore dignity to the defeated postwar Japan, and to keep the Russian Communists from overtaking the orient as they had Eastern Europe. MacArthur is eventually fired from his post by President Truman after the general defies orders during the Korean conflict. MacArthur was intended as Universal's "answer" to 20th Century-Fox's enormously successful Patton (1970), but box-office returns were disappointing(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Disney's The Kid</title>
    <desc lang="en">If you could talk to the child that you used to be, what advice would you give him? That question forms the basis of this comic fantasy. Forty-year-old Russ Duritz (Bruce Willis) is a wealthy and powerful "image consultant" who has made a career out of telling people how to present themselves. But while he's a success in business, he's a failure in life; he's vain, mean-spirited, and hasn't been able to hold onto a marriage (or even a pet dog). One day, Russ is startled to meet Rusty (Spencer Breslin), a stocky kid whom he soon realizes is himself at the age of eight, having passed through a wrinkle in time. Young Rusty doesn't seem much happier than the grown-up Russ, so the older man takes his younger self under his wing and tries to teach him how to avoid the mistakes he's made, while Rusty encourages Russ to be a more caring human being. Along the way, Russ and Rusty become friends, and realize how much they can learn from each other. Disney's The Kid also stars Jean Smart as one of Russ' clients, Lily Tomlin as his assistant, and Daniel Von Bargen as his father(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Casper</title>
    <desc lang="en">Based on the popular cartoon character, this family-oriented "ghost story" is about a not-so-scary spirit who bonds with a little girl (Christina Ricci). The eternally irritable Ms. Carrigan (Cathy Moriarty) discovers that the only thing she's been left in her recently departed father's will is a rickety old house in New England. Naturally, the woman is furious about this, until her "close personal friend" and assistant, Dibbs (Eric Idle of Monty Python fame), discovers a secret message that a treasure may be concealed somewhere in the house. The two take off for Maine, only to learn that the house is haunted by Casper "the friendly ghost" and his three ghostly uncles Stinky, Stretch, and Fatso. After futilely recruiting an exorcist (Don Novello, more or less reviving his Father Guido Sarducci character from Saturday Night Live) and a "professional ghost exterminator" (Dan Aykroyd), she brings in a "ghost psychiatrist" (Bill Pullman) and his daughter Kat (Ricci). Innocently attracted to the young girl, Casper befriends Kat as they try to save the ghosts' home from the evil Carrigan. Eye-popping special effects highlight this magical story that touches (albeit lightly) on the theme of what lies at the heart of human desires. Clint Eastwood, Rodney Dangerfield, Mel Gibson and The Crypt Keeper (of Tales from the Crypt) all make cameos as apparitions in the mirror Bill Pullman looks into in the house(n)</desc>

Michael Keaton stars as Daryl Poynter, a hustling, successful Philadelphia real estate agent who has become addicted to cocaine. He's already got problems, including nearly a $100,000 embezzled from his employer and lost on the stock market, when he wakes up one morning with a young woman dead in his bed from a coke overdose. His company is asking questions about the missing funds, and the dead girl's father is plastering his neighborhood with posters accusing Daryl of being a murderer, so he decides to hide out in an anonymous drug treatment program. There, however, Daryl runs into tough-minded counselor and former addict Craig (Morgan Freeman), who has heard all of Daryl's lies and tricks before. Daryl also finds romance with an abused fellow addict, Charlie Standers (Kathy Baker), and understanding with his Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor (M. Emmet Walsh)(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Fast Times at Ridgemont High</title>
    <desc lang="en">Back in the late 1970s, author Cameron Crowe banked upon his youthful appearance to pose as a teen-aged high school student. The results of his hands-on research was the revelatory book Fast Times at Ridgemont High, which went on to spectacular success as a theatrical feature. The sociological inner lining of Crowe's book was sacrificed in favor of standard teen-movie dialogue and Animal House-style comedy, but the film is impossible to dislike, and it spawned a legion of future imitators. Ostensibly, the main characters are brother and sister Jennifer Jason Leigh and Judge Reinhold. However, the real breakthrough star is Sean Penn as the perpetually zoned-out Jeff Spicoli. It is Penn who has the film's most famous scene, wherein the decorum of teacher Hand (Ray Walston)'s classroom is interrupted by a pizza delivery. Fast Times at Ridgemont High was spun off into a TV series, the short-lived 1986 weekly Fast Times(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This Hallmark Channel TV movie is one of several starring Kellie Martin as Samantha "Sam" Kinsey, the owner of a British-style American bookshop which specializes in mystery novels. As is her habit, Sam ends up playing amateur detective herself, this time at a fancy health spa called Drummonds. One of the spa's customers, a woman named Debbie (Allison Smith) is found murdered, and suspicion immediately falls upon Alice (Bess Meyer), whose husband George (Scott Grimes) and Debbie were having an affair. Complicating matters is the presence of a psychic named Emily (Felicia Day) who with unbecoming eagerness offers to direct the police to the location where Debbie's body has been hidden. As a result, Emily herself is accused of the murder--and at this point Sam and her friends Cassie (Nina Siemaszko) and Philby (Clarence Williams III)--the latter a former CIA agent!--try their hand at ferreting out the real killer. Mystery Woman: Vision of Murder debuted June 5, 2005(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Haunter</title>
    <desc lang="en">A teenage ghost teams up with a living girl to stop a phantom killer, and break a vicious supernatural cycle in this psychological horror tale from director Vincenzo Natali (Cube, Splice). Lisa Johnson (Abigail Breslin) was just one day shy of 16 when her entire family perished back in 1986. Ever since, the spirits of the young girl and her family have been trapped reliving the monotonous routine of their last day alive. Meanwhile, in the present day, young Olivia (Eleanor Zichy) moves into the Johnson's old house with her family, and bears witness to a disturbing transformation; her typically loving father is acting like a man possessed, prompting the startled teen to fear for her family's safety. Later, after failing to break through to her own family, Lisa manages to communicate with Olivia, and makes a shocking discovery: The house was once owned by a notorious serial killer who preyed on young girls (Stephen McHattie). Although dead, the madman has summoned the power to possess the living, and now dwells in the body of Olivia's father. Now, should the two girls fail to manage to stop the killer soon, the worst may be yet to come(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Die Hard 2</title>
    <desc lang="en">"Another basement, another elevator...how can the same thing happen to the same guy twice?" asks John McClane (Bruce Willis), in what is doubtless the key question of this film. A year after foiling the terrorist takeover of a high-rise office building in the first movie, McClane is waiting to pick up his wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), at Dulles International Airport just outside Washington, D.C., on Christmas Eve. Scheduled to arrive the same evening is Ramon Esperanza (Franco Nero), a South American political figure who is being brought to the United States to stand trial for his role in a drug-smuggling ring. However, a group of terrorists, led by renegade American military officer Col. Stuart (William Sadler), take control of the airport, scuttling radio transmissions and placing their own men in the control tower. Stuart and his men ensure that Esperanza's plane lands safely, and then demand that Stuart and his men be given a fully-fueled 747 and free passage wherever they choose to go. Otherwise, they will guide the many circling jets waiting for landing instructions into definite crash landings, killing the many passengers on board. Not willing to stand aside as terrorists once again threaten his wife's life, the wise-cracking McClane once again leaps into action to foil Stuart's plans and bring the passenger jets safely to the ground. William Atherton, John Amos, Dennis Franz, and John Leguizamo highlight the supporting cast(n)</desc>

After rising through the domestic ranks and winning both the British and Commonwealth titles, Froch claimed his first world crown by defeating Jean Pascal in 2008, and was a dominant fighter on the world scene from that point on. His legacy was assured in May 2014 when he defeated fellow Brit George Groves in a rematch at Wembley Stadium in what proved to be his final fight. That contest drew the largest attendance for a boxing bout in the UK since the Second World War at 80,000. Last in the series.(n)</desc>

Knight), or the interns' granite-faced supervisor Bailey (Chandra Wilson). Back at Seattle Grace, Derek picks George to assist him during an extremely delicate brain operation, but George may lose the opportunity if he speaks up about the drinking problem of veteran anestheseologist Dr. Taylor. Elsewhere, Izzie performs emergency surgery on a disgruntled gent who has swallowed his girlfriend's car keys; Alex (Justin Chambers) meets a fellow former wrestler named Owens (Russell Hornsby), who has developed a morbid fascination with self-mutilation; and several of the interns become involved in the plight of a teenager who is suffering the aftereffects of a botched gastric bypass operation(n)</desc>

In the course of events, it is revealed that Seibert is a drug abuser, wife beater and all-around louse--and he is also in desperate need of a liver transplant. Ironically, the perfect donor turns out to be the very man whom Seibert killed on the road, placing the surgical interns smack in the middle of a major ethical dilemma. Elsewhere, George (T.R. Knight) is forced to work side by side with the same nurse who gave him syphillis; Webber (James Pickens Jr.) gets what-for from his wife (Loretta Devine) for having brain surgery without her knowledge; Meredith (Ellen Pompeo) and Cristina (Sandra Oh) do their best to lose themselves in their work and forget their romantic travails; and we finally find out the reason for the rift between Derek (Patrick Dempsey) and Addison (Kate Walsh)(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In lieu of honing in on a past or current event (as is the common practice with National Geographic documentaries), this unique program speculates on the future - more specifically, on the dire fate of the Earth in the scenario that all human beings are indiscriminately wiped out by a full-scale cataclysm, such as drought, nuclear war, or the onset of a new ice age. What would the fate of man-made structures be, if suddenly abandoned? How long would it take the ecosphere to rebound from the damage thrust onto it by men and women, in the instance that homo sapiens vanish? These are the sorts of questions posed by Aftermath - Population Zero.

Reilly) goes off to cut the heart out of a sea monster, which could be the key to curing his wife (Salma Hayek) of infertility; in another, a dim-witted ruler (Toby Jones) neglects his daughter's search for a husband as he becomes obsessed with a flea that grows to enormous size; in the last tale, an oversexed monarch (Vincent Cassel) is bewitched by an elderly woman with a beautiful singing voice.

(gay best friend). The moment Tanner (Michael J. Willett) reveals his true sexuality to his classmates he rockets up the social ladder. Suddenly, he's decked out in the latest fashions, and living it up with the in-crowd. Meanwhile, the friends who used to be part of Tanner's inner circle get left out in the cold. Now Tanner will be faced with the most difficult decision of his high school career -- keep riding the popularity train and accept his role as a human fashion accessory, or go back to the people who have always accepted him for who he really is.

    <desc lang="en">(2007) Ethan and Joel Coen's Oscar-laden thriller stars Josh Brolin as Llewelyn Moss, a trailer-dwelling welder and hunter. Hunting deer in the desert, he comes across a drugs exchange which has gone bloodily wrong, and among the detritus is a case containing $2m. He decides to appropriate the money, but it's not a wise move: he soon has the deadly assassin Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) on his trail, as well as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), and smiling bounty hunter Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson). As Moss tries to keep hold of the cash, and preserve both his own life and that of his wife Carla (Kelly Macdonald), a deadly game of cat-and-mouse is played out across the Tex-Mex border, as pursuers and the pursued try to gain the upper hand. In English, and Spanish with English subtitles. M,W,S(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Day</title>
    <desc lang="en">A small band of friends make an uneasy alliance with a mysterious lone wolf in this blend of horror and adventure. An unnamed catastrophe has turned the Earth into a wasteland, and as packs of feral cannibals wander the countryside, a dwindling number of survivors struggle to stay alive. Rick (Dominic Monaghan), Adam (Shawn Ashmore), Henson (Cory Hardrict), and Shannon (Shannyn Sossamon) have been journeying together for months and are the last living members of a much larger group. Mary (Ashley Bell) is a solitary woman who crossed paths with the survivors and is now traveling with them. She isn't interested in discussing her past or becoming friends, but the others learn she's a powerful ally in a fight. The travelers take shelter in a house, but are soon surrounded by cannibals; they quickly realize just how strong a warrior Mary can be, while also discovering the terrible truth that led her to wander alone. The Day was directed by Douglas Aarniokoski, who has accumulated extensive credits as an assistant director and helming second-unit material on major films(n)</desc>

Tom (Braff) is an aspiring chef whose wife Sofia (Amanda Peet) has just quit her high-paying job to stay home with their new baby. When it becomes abundantly clear that they can no longer maintain their New York City lifestyle, the family picks up and moves to Sofia's hometown in Ohio, where Tom is hired to work at her father's ad agency. It is there that Tom meets Chip (Bateman), the agency's wheelchair-bound golden boy, who also happened to have a one-night stand with Sofia while the two were cheerleaders in high school. Suddenly, Tom finds himself sabotaged by Chip at every step as the nefarious paraplegic schemes to steal Sofia from him and destroy any chance he might have of success at the agency.

    <desc lang="en">Queer, There and Everywhere. Brian's (Gale Harold) new baby is the topic of a conference call between Michael (Hal Sparks), Ted (Scott Lowell), and Emmett (Peter Paige). The three men are all chatting from their jobs, and Ted is simultaneously ogling some internet porn. He quickly puts down the phone when his boss walks into his office. Neither Ted nor Michael is out at work, and Michael even feels compelled to laugh when an obnoxious co-worker makes fun of gay customers. Justin (Randy Harrison) graphically describes his encounter with Brian to his schoolmate, Daphne (Makyla Smith). While Justin is telling Daphne he's in love, Brian is seducing a married man at a business meeting, leading to a quickie in the men's room. Michael, in an effort to conceal his sexual preference, encourages the interest of a pretty female co-worker, Tracy (Lindsey Connell). He's roped into socializing with a small group after work, and Emmett gives him a sports magazine to study, so he'll pass for straight. Brian gets into a tiff with Lindsay (Thea Gill) and Melanie (Michelle Clunie) because they want him to take out a one-million-dollar insurance policy to provide for Gus, their baby boy. That night, Justin comes looking for Brian, who avoids him. Michael feels responsible, and takes Justin to a diner, where he explains to the stricken teen that "Brian doesn't do boyfriends." They're waited on by a wise-cracking middle-aged waitress, Debbie (Sharon Gless of Cagney &amp; Lacey fame), who turns out to be Michael's mom. Michael is in denial about his crush on Brian, but Justin picks up on it quickly. Justin drops in on Brian, interrupting another anonymous tryst. Brian gets over his annoyance long enough to tell Justin, "I don't believe in love."(n)</desc>

Ted's mother, Mrs. Schmidt (Elva Mai Hooper), is understandably distraught to learn that her son was given drugs by a stranger he picked up, who then left him to die. Justin (Randy Harrison) shares detention with a football player he's attracted to, and ends up pleasuring the jock with his hand. Melanie (Michelle Clunie), who happens to be Ted's lawyer, shows up at Brian's office to tell him Ted has named him in a living will, and he's responsible for deciding whether Ted will stay on life support. Brian can't handle the responsibility, and gets into another heated exchange with Mel. Justin reacts badly when his mother (Sherry Miller) calmly confronts him about his sexual preference. Justin runs away and goes looking for Brian. Emmett and Michael go to Ted's apartment to remove all evidence of his lifestyle (e.g. dildos, porn) before Mrs. Schmidt shows up. At Ted's, they find a shrine to Michael. "He collects you the way you collect comics," Emmett points out. Brian goes to the hospital and curses out the comatose Ted before getting it on with an orderly in the next bed. Ted awakens from his coma just in time to hear them going at it. Brian goes to Debbie's (Sharon Gless) to relay the good news, where he finds Justin waiting for him(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Art of Desperation. After his big date, Michael (Hal Sparks) is convinced that David (Chris Potter) doesn't like him. Brian (Gale Harold) convinces him to pay another visit to the chiropractor's office. Ted (Scott Lowell), determined to give up club life, finds a speed dating service called Date Bait for gay men over 30, and drags Emmett (Peter Paige) along for company. "I have no desire to have sex with any of them," says Emmett of the assembled men. "Neither do I," answers Ted, "That's a start." He ends up going out with Roger (Darrin Baker), a slightly chubby, bald musician. Michael goes out with David again, and this time, they spend the night together. Ted and Roger go out on a date, but they both seem more interested in the cute waiter than each other. Justin (Randy Harrison) befriends Lindsay (Thea Gill) and Melanie (Michelle Clunie), and after seeing his drawings (including a nude of Brian), Lindsay invites him to participate in an art show at the gay and lesbian center. Michael takes David to a club, and David explains he hasn't been out much because he was with his former boyfriend for six years before he died. Brian meets David, and makes a pass at him while Michael is getting them drinks. At the art show, Justin watches the door and waits for Brian to arrive. When Brian does show up, surprisingly, David suspiciously watches the way he is with Michael. David's jealousy is further aroused when Melanie drunkenly tells him that "Michael and Brian is the greatest love story never told," before she realizes who David is. Jennifer (Sherry Miller) also comes to the show and tries to conceal her shock at Justin's homoerotic work. Ted finally gets horny enough to have sex with Roger, but things don't go well(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Daddy Dearest (Sonny Boy). Emmett (Peter Paige) is becoming obsessive about cybersex, but his online persona is that of a muscular "top," so he can't meet any of the people he has sex with on his computer. When baby Gus comes down with a fever, Lindsay (Thea Gill) and Melanie (Michelle Clunie) rush him to the hospital, but Mel not being Gus' birth mother or his legal guardian, is not allowed into the emergency room. On top of that, she has a verbal altercation with a homophobic desk nurse. She wants to petition for second parent adoption, but first Brian (Gale Harold) has to relinquish his parental rights. Emmett is unnerved when he has visions of his hunky screen name, Pitts9x6 (Steve Boyle), coming to life and ordering him around, trying to make him more like his fantasy self. Michael (Hal Sparks) is nervous about a dinner party at David's (Chris Potter), and has the gang give him a crash course in table manners. It turns out to be an awkward affair, and only gets worse when Michael realizes, and announces, that one of the other guests once gave him an STD. Brian, after agreeing to give up parental rights to Gus, goes to visit his own father (Lawrence Dane), a broken-down drunk who doesn't know Brian is gay, and borrows money from his son. He says that Brian is just like him, and was never meant to settle down. The dinner party has Michael thinking that he and David are going to break up, but David has very different plans. This episode was directed by John Greyson (Zero Patience)(n)</desc>

Lindsay (Thea Gill) decides that she doesn't want to go back to work when her maternity leave is up, sending Melanie (Michelle Clunie) scrambling for a way to make living on a single income financially feasible. Justin (Randy Harrison) goes home for his little sister's birthday party, and Jennifer (Sherry Miller) tries to get him to stay, but he knows his father won't accept who he is. Brian (Gale Harold) comes home to find that his apartment has been robbed because Justin failed to turn on his alarm system. He angrily throws Justin out. A cross-dressing psychic uses a Ouja board to tell Michael that Brian is his true love. Then Justin's friend, Daphne (Makyla Smith), shows up to tell the gang that Justin has run away to New York, and they soon learn that he's using Brian's credit card. Michael cancels his dinner plans with David, Lindsay, and Melanie to join Brian, Emmett (Peter Paige), and Ted (Scott Lowell) on a road trip to New York to track Justin down. Out on the road, Brian tells Michael that he'll miss being with him if he moves in with David.

Brian says he'll make it up by throwing a surprise birthday party for Michael's upcoming 30th birthday. He even invites David. Ted gets good news from the doctor's office, but Emmett gets a message telling him to come to the office first thing Monday, leaving him fearing the worst. At Michael's "surprise" birthday party, David's gift of an expensive watch can't compete with Brian having "Captain Astro" himself show up with a rare and valuable comic book for Michael. Ted chastises Brian, and tells him to let Michael go, and Brian petulantly tells Ted that everyone know he's in love with Michael. Emmett makes a pact with God, promising to give up sex with men in exchange for being HIV negative. The biggest surprise of the night comes when Tracy (Lindsey Connell) shows up at the party, and Brian outs Michael to her, sending a shocked and heartbroken Michael back into the arms of David(n)</desc>

As a child, Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) lived a comfortable life as the son of wealthy parents, but the realities of life in crime-ridden Gotham City were brought home to him when his mother and father were murdered. Wayne pledged to bring justice and order back to the city and avenge the death of his parents, and one day he is approached by Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), a teacher who guides him in the study of martial arts and the ways in which an ordinary man can become a champion. With the help of Ducard and gadget master Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), Wayne develops a secret identity as Batman, a masked fighter for justice who is determined to bring peace and safety back to Gotham.

    <title lang="en">Batman Begins</title>
    <desc lang="en">The origins of the Caped Crusader of Gotham City are finally brought to the big screen in this new adaptation of the perennially popular comic-book series. As a child, Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) lived a comfortable life as the son of wealthy parents, but the realities of life in crime-ridden Gotham City were brought home to him when his mother and father were murdered. Wayne pledged to bring justice and order back to the city and avenge the death of his parents, and one day he is approached by Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), a teacher who guides him in the study of martial arts and the ways in which an ordinary man can become a champion. With the help of Ducard and gadget master Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), Wayne develops a secret identity as Batman, a masked fighter for justice who is determined to bring peace and safety back to Gotham. Batman Begins also features Michael Caine as faithful manservant Alfred Pennyworth, Gary Oldman as Lt. James Gordon, Katie Holmes as Wayne's sweetheart, Rachel Dawes, and Cillian Murphy as the villainous Scarecrow(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In 'Brooklyn's Finest', we're taken on a dark ride through the streets of Brooklyn, following three New York Police officers as they wrestle with temptation while attempting to uphold the law and deal with the pressures of the job. Eddie (Richard Gere) is a bitter and disillusioned veteran cop who's a week away from retirement. Tango (Don Cheadle) is an undercover narcotics cop who tries desperately to leave the streets and earn a promotion to a desk job. Much like Eddie, he's lost sight of his priorities and his loyalties seem to lie more with notorious inner-city drug dealer Caz (Wesley Snipes) than with the boys in blue. At the same time, narcotics detective Sal is a family man in despair and needs to raise money to buy a better house for his family. In seven days, the lives of all three officers will converge at one crime scene(n)</desc>

After the gang busts the ancient kung fu king known as The Beast (Leung Siu Lung) out of jail, tensions reach a boiling point as Pig Sty Alley's landlady (Yuen Qiu) leads an all-out attack against the gang and Sing discovers his true heroic fate.

As the men struggle with the fact that Herb isn't much of a hoofer (and Charlie can't dance at all) under the strict tutelage of cruise director Godwyn (Brent Spiner), Charlie starts sweet-talking beautiful heiress Liz (Dyan Cannon), while Herb finds a soul mate in Vivian (Gloria DeHaven), who lost her husband not long ago.

Benjamin Fiedler (Daryl Sabara) is about to become a man, though the prospect of reciting a language he doesn't even really know in front of a temple full of strangers is so daunting that it makes him wish he could just stay a boy and write the whole thing off. As if his personal peccadilloes weren't enough to rack Benjamin's nerves, his father, Adam (Jeremy Piven), and mother, Joanne (Jami Gertz), are determined to send Benjamin into the adult world in true style. Recently, Adam's rival agent, Arnie Stein (Larry Miller), threw down the gauntlet for his own son's bar mitzvah by hosting a no-holds-barred bash that made New Year's Eve in Times Square look like cake-and-coffee day at the retirement community, and ultra-competitive Adam is determined to prove that he can top that now-legendary party. When Adam's aging, hippy-dippy father, Irwin (Garry Marshall), rolls into town in a broken-down RV with his dizzy young girlfriend, Sandy (Daryl Hannah), however, it appears as if all of his plans to out-class Arnie Stein may have been for naught(n)</desc>

Aubert), a saleswoman at the Pimp N' Ho's Boutique, and keep things orderly at Holy Moly's Doughnut Shop, Day-Day attempts to transform himself into a master of crime-fighting, which causes a lot more problems than it solves. Friday After Next is the first feature film from director Marcus Raboy, who previously directed music videos for Sting, Li'l Kim, Staind, and Friday After Next star Ice Cube(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In 1998, rapper Jay-Z's third album, Vol. 2: Hard Knock Life made him one of hip-hop's biggest crossover acts, with the single "Hard Knock Life" becoming a major hit on radio and the sales charts. In 1999, Jay-Z, who also runs the hip-hop oriented Rock-A-Fella Records label, launched a major concert tour, in which he joined forces with fellow rappers Method Man, DMX, and Redman for a road trip that packed halls at 54 shows in two months, earning $18 million at the turnstiles. This documentary takes a close look at the music Jay-Z and his friends created onstage, as well as their adventures -- both positive and negative -- as they take one of rap's biggest shows on the road. Hard Knock Life Tour also features new music from The Lox, Memphis Bleek, and T-Boz from the R&amp;B group TLC. Incidentally, if the title sounds a bit familiar to non-rap fans, it may be because it was sampled from a song featured in the musical Annie(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Burked. Having resolved the series' first-season cliffhanger with the life-saving gesture of CSI second-in-command Catherine Willows (Marg Helgenberger) (the life saved was that of Catherine's boss, Gil Grissom [William L. Peterson]), CSI: Crime Scene Investigation was able to go off on a new tangent for its second-season opener. The case at hand: the drug-related death of Las Vegas casino executive Tony Braun. Early evidence suggests that Braun OD'ed on heroin, but further investigation reveals that the victim was bound with duct tape just before his demise. Grissom's conclusion: Braun was forced to literally drug himself to death. Originally slated to air on September 20, 2001, "Burked" was moved back one week due to ongoing network coverage of the 9/11 tragedy(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Nervous Man in a $4 Room</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Nervous Man in a $4 Room. Though obviously an episode designed to absorb the costs of the more expensive Twilight Zone installments, this was one of the better efforts of the series' second season, with a tour de force performance by Joe Mantell as penny-ante gangster Jackie Rhoades. Ordered to bump off a rival gangster, the timorous Rhoades tries to summon up the courage for the foul deed, only to be thwarted at every turn by his own conscience -- who as it turns out has more "guts" than Jackie ever dreamed of. Though essentially a solo endeavor, the episode also features a good performance from future producer-director William D. Gordon as Jackie's nasty boss, while another future director, Brian G. Hutton, serves as Joe Mantell's back-to-camera stand-in when the actor "confronts" himself. Written by Rod Serling and scored by Jerry Goldsmith, "Nervous Man in a Four Dollar Room" was the first episode produced for Twilight Zone's second season, even though it was telecast as the third episode, on October 14, 1960(n)</desc>
