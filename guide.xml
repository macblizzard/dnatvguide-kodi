    <desc lang="en">When a bumbling movie lover becomes magnetized while attempting to sabotage a local power plant and accidentally erases all of the videotapes in the small video store where his best friend works, the pair attempt to keep the store's loyal customer base by remaking as many of the top-renting movies as possible. Mike (Mos Def) is an employee at Be Kind Rewind, a modest mom and pop video store that is owned by Mr. Fletcher (Danny Glover). Mike's best friend Jerry (Jack Black) works in an auto garage/junkyard directly adjacent to a local power plant. Lately Jerry has become increasingly paranoid about the effects that the power plant is having on his health. Convinced that he has developed a brain tumor from working in such close proximity to the power plant, Jerry attempts to sabotage the plant. Unfortunately for Jerry, his brain is magnetized in the process. The next time Jerry goes to visit Mike at Be Kind Rewind, the powerful magnetization emanating from his brain erases every videotape in the store. Now the only way for Mike and Jerry to be sure that Be Kind Rewind stays in business is to remake every film on the shelves before the customers notice. But when word gets out that Mike and Jerry have remade such Hollywood classics as Back to the Future, Robocop, The Lion King, and Rush Hour without permission, the store is threatened with copyright violations and forced to close its doors. In the aftermath of the closing, Mr. Fletcher and his employees discover just how loyal their customers really are when the entire neighborhood pools their resources to transform the junkyard into a legitimate movie studio and produce an entirely original film detailing the incredible adventures of a local jazz legend(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Nicky has studied the science of human nature his whole life, and understands precisely how to earn anyone's trust, or fool them into never noticing he's stealing their watch, or wallet, or anything they might have that Nicky can sell. In the movie's opening sequence, he's eating at a New York restaurant when the gorgeous Jess approaches his table and asks him to pretend to be her boyfriend so that she can avoid a particularly determined guy at the bar who won't stop hitting on her. The two of them hit it off, but he quickly figures out that she's running a scam on him and soon turns the tables on her and her partner. Undaunted, Jess begs Nicky to teach her what he knows about the criminal life, and he brings her in on a plan to steal from as many people as possible during Super Bowl week in New Orleans. She turns out to be a natural, and quickly learns the ropes of this unscrupulous world. Nicky and Jess seem to be falling for each other, but Nicky's actions at the end of their New Orleans trip force Jess to reassess their relationship. Three years later, Nicky enters into a deal with Garriga (Rodrigo Santoro), a wealthy playboy who has a software program that will help his Formula 1 team triumph. Nicky agrees to help Garriga sell a fake version of the program to his competitors, but as the plan goes into motion he discovers Jess and Garriga are a couple. As old feelings complicate the new arrangement, Nicky must also contend with the no-nonsense Owens (Gerald McRaney), Garriga's head-of-security who openly distrusts Nicky(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Deck the Halls</title>
    <desc lang="en">When the spirit of Christmas compels a small-town New Englander to decorate his home with enough lights to make it visible from space, much more is set to be decked than just the halls in this holiday comedy featuring Danny DeVito and Matthew Broderick as two warring neighbors determined to outdo each other in creating the best lighting display on the planet. Christmas is without question the most wonderful time of the year for Cloverdale, MA optometrist Steve Finch (Broderick). Unfortunately, the same can't be said for Steve's wife, Kelly (Kristin Davis), and the pair's two children, Madison (Alia Shawkat) and Carter (Dylan Blue). Despite Steve's annual holiday zeal, the rest of the Carters have grown to resent the seemingly endless family rituals leading up the Winterfest carnival over which their terminally cheerful patriarch presides. Though it seems that nothing in the world could dampen the spirits of the local "King of Christmas," Steve soon finds his royal status challenged when used-car salesman Buddy Hall (Danny DeVito) moves in next door and covers his house with enough festive lights to make it visible from the deepest crater of the moon. His Yuletide thunder effectively stolen, Steve resorts to desperate measures in regaining his crown when Buddy's lavish decorations make him a local celebrity, his wife strikes up a warm friendship with the neighbor's outspoken better half, Tia (Kristin Chenoweth), and even the kids seem to warm to the car salesman's air-headed twin daughters, Ashley and Emily (Sabrina and Kelly Aldridge)(n)</desc>

Suave gangster Charlie Barrett (Christopher Walken) meets four young men who have taken over his regular booth at a popular bistro. Charmed by the swaggering kids, he agrees to take a ride with them, but they give him a sedative and he awakens in a deserted mansion, taped to a chair with one of his fingers missing. One of his abductors, Avery (Henry Thomas), says that he has a sister who has been kidnapped and they need two million dollars to get her back, as well as a finger to exchange for her severed digit. Charlie phones his lawyer Marty (Cliff De Young), who calls a henchman, Lono (Denis Leary), who investigates the kidnappings and gives Charlie enough information to start playing each of his inexperienced abductors against the others(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Nicky has studied the science of human nature his whole life, and understands precisely how to earn anyone's trust, or fool them into never noticing he's stealing their watch, or wallet, or anything they might have that Nicky can sell. In the movie's opening sequence, he's eating at a New York restaurant when the gorgeous Jess approaches his table and asks him to pretend to be her boyfriend so that she can avoid a particularly determined guy at the bar who won't stop hitting on her. The two of them hit it off, but he quickly figures out that she's running a scam on him and soon turns the tables on her and her partner. Undaunted, Jess begs Nicky to teach her what he knows about the criminal life, and he brings her in on a plan to steal from as many people as possible during Super Bowl week in New Orleans. She turns out to be a natural, and quickly learns the ropes of this unscrupulous world. Nicky and Jess seem to be falling for each other, but Nicky's actions at the end of their New Orleans trip force Jess to reassess their relationship. Three years later, Nicky enters into a deal with Garriga (Rodrigo Santoro), a wealthy playboy who has a software program that will help his Formula 1 team triumph. Nicky agrees to help Garriga sell a fake version of the program to his competitors, but as the plan goes into motion he discovers Jess and Garriga are a couple. As old feelings complicate the new arrangement, Nicky must also contend with the no-nonsense Owens (Gerald McRaney), Garriga's head-of-security who openly distrusts Nicky(n)</desc>

A troubled conman's past catches up to him in the A&amp;E documentary American Justice: Who Killed the Candy Heiress -- Helen Bach. When millionairess Helen Brach disappeared in 1977, her absence wasn't noticed for two weeks. A fan of the horse races, Brach spent her time at the stables with her prize-winning breeds. The police were baffled by the case and came up with no suspects for 20 years. Then, in 1995, a list was compiled while working on the capture of an ill-willed ladies man named Richard Bailey which piqued the interest of detectives. Turns out Bailey was a costly habit for rich women. Prosecutors' suppositions were so strong that Bailey was convicted of the plot and sentenced to life in prison. Through interviews and footage, A&amp;E reconstructs the case of the missing millionaire(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Presenters Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May are challenged to build a bridge over the River Kwai in Thailand. In order to do that, however, they have to drive across Burma, a country that has been largely closed to Westerners for more than 40 years, and must make the trip in three lorries, each bought sight unseen from the internet on a limited budget. What follows is an epic journey of beautiful scenery, regular adversity, ongoing malfunction and the constant bickering of the three men.(n)</desc>

James defends the honour of the car in a very small Renault, Richard tries to prove that pedalling is faster by riding a bicycle, while Jeremy attempts to demonstrate that water is the quickest way across town by piloting a hovercraft. To make matters more complicated, all three presenters are racing not only one another but also the Stig, who is making his way toward the finish line by public transport. Plus, the new Lamborghini Huracan is put through its paces and singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran takes to the test track in the Reasonably Priced Car.(n)</desc>

But his mysterious death at just 19 years of age has never been explained. Now, Dallas Campbell reveals new scientific research aimed at getting to the truth. A CT scan of the pharaoh's mummified body creates a full-size image of the real Tutankhamun, while DNA analysis uncovers a shocking secret about his family background - and the genetic trail leads to a revolutionary new theory about his sudden and unexpected death.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">First Steps.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Naturalist David Attenborough documents the universal tale that unites humanity with every other animal on the planet - the journey through life, and the goal to continue the bloodline through offspring. This edition focuses on the first hurdle any animal will face, surviving infancy. Cameras follow flightless barnacle goose chicks as they strive to find food, leaping 400ft down a cliff from the ledge where they hatched. Meanwhile, in New Zealand, young fur seals have stumbled across a safe haven in which they can learn how to avoid predators, while deep in the Gobi Desert, the long-eared jerboa learns to use its impeccable hearing to catch insect pray. Plus, albatross chicks make their first flight, as threatening tiger sharks wait patiently for them to slip up and land in the sea.(n)</desc>

Looking at examples including a tiger cub whose family is under threat, a vulnerable veined octopus and a pair of sibling cheetahs guarding against starvation, the veteran naturalist illustrates how they develop new skills and learn how to survive on their own.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The importance of homes to animals, not only as a place to live but as a shelter from the elements and a refuge from enemies. A pack of African hunting dogs have made their home on a vast plain in Zambia, but it's far from safe as they must battle hyenas and protect their young. Hermit crabs on a tropical island settle down in empty snail shells - and when a new property washes ashore, they all form a queue, then move up the housing chain until all the shells are taken. On the edge of the Sahara are chimpanzees, whose survival relies on knowing where to find water in the most extreme droughts. Here the elders lead a troop on a brutal trek to a dried-out riverbed to dig wells.(n)</desc>

A meerkat society will only allow newcomers in if they know how to deal with a venomous snake.

    <desc lang="en">Naturalist David Attenborough documents the universal tale that unites humanity with every other animal on the planet - the journey through life, and the goal to continue the bloodline through offspring. This edition focuses on the first hurdle any animal will face, surviving infancy. Cameras follow flightless barnacle goose chicks as they strive to find food, leaping 400ft down a cliff from the ledge where they hatched. Meanwhile, in New Zealand, young fur seals have stumbled across a safe haven in which they can learn how to avoid predators, while deep in the Gobi Desert, the long-eared jerboa learns to use its impeccable hearing to catch insect pray. Plus, albatross chicks make their first flight, as threatening tiger sharks wait patiently for them to slip up and land in the sea.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">And Soon the Darkness</title>
    <desc lang="en">A carefree vacation to exotic Argentina turns into a sun-soaked nightmare for two young women who find themselves at the mercy of a cunning psychopath in this remake of director Robert Fuest's 1970 thriller. Stephanie (Amber Heard) and Ellie (Odette Yustman) are biking through the Argentinean countryside when they stop to spend the last night of their vacation in a secluded village. When darkness falls, the girls wander over to the nearest bar, where a handsome local charms Ellie while Stephanie heads back to the hotel to good night's sleep. But her rest is interrupted when Stephanie returns to the hotel with her new friend in tow, and a booze-fueled altercation ultimately leads the girls to miss their bus. The following day, Ellie leaves Stephanie alone in the countryside following a heated argument, and grows concerned when her traveling companion fails to meet her at a nearby restaurant shortly thereafter. In the wake of a chance meeting with American expatriate Michael (Karl Urban), whom she had previously seen getting into a minor altercation at the bar, Stephanie reports Ellie's disappearance to local policeman Calvo (César Vianco), who immediately dismisses her suspicions of foul play. Thankfully Michael displays a bit more concern than the local sheriff, and agrees to assist Stephanie in searching for Ellie. But now the more Stephanie confides in Michael, the more she begins to fear that he may have had something to do with Ellie's disappearance, and that by sticking with him she may be walking straight into his trap(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Hatchet</title>
    <desc lang="en">A handful of college students looking for a good time are thrown into a world of danger in this homage to the slasher film cycle of the 1970s and '80s. Ben (Joel David Moore) has just been given his walking papers by his girlfriend and is deeply depressed. Needing a pick-me-up, Ben and his friend Marcus (Deon Richmond) head to New Orleans for Mardi Gras, and take in a "Haunted Swamp Tour," with master of ceremonies Shawn (Parry Shen) guiding guests through a spooky patch of bayou country. Along the way, Ben and Marcus meet a pair of half-bright exotic dancers, Misty (Mercedes McNab) and Jenna (Joleigh Fioreavanti), as well as Marybeth (Tamara Feldman), a pretty girl who is secretive about her past. As they tour the swamp, Shawn tells his customers about the local legend of Victor Crowley, a deformed man who was taunted by the other children living near the swamp until he was nearly bludgeoned with an axe by his father while trying to open the door of their burning shack. While Ben and Marcus don't think much of the story at first, it doesn't take long before they have serious reason to believe Victor Crowley is still at large -- and is looking to settle some old scores. Hatchet received its world premiere at the 2006 Tribeca Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Nigella Lawson travels to Venice to soak up the atmosphere and gain inspiration for dishes for a Christmas party with an Italian twist. Back in the UK, she creates a tasty buffet menu for her guests, preparing a Venetian cocktail served with quick and easy canapes including Parmesan shortbreads and panettone stuffing squares. Nigella's take on the traditional roast bird is turkey breast stuffed with Italian sausage and marsala-steeped cranberries, served with salad and Brussels sprout pasta. Guests are treated to desserts including a marshmallow cappuccino pavlova and a Christmas pudding cake adorned with chocolate chips and pomegranate seeds.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Former MTV executive Joel Gallen makes his feature directorial debut with this broad spoof of the popular teen comedy genre, lampooning dozens of movies including American Pie (1999), American Beauty (1999), Bring It On (2000), Clueless (1995), She's All That (1999), Road Trip (2000), Can't Hardly Wait (1998), 10 Things I Hate About You (1999), Never Been Kissed (1999), and even the teen films of an earlier era such as The Breakfast Club (1985). At the aptly titled "John Hughes High School," aspiring artist Janey Briggs (Chyler Leigh) is an outcast because of her plain, bespectacled looks and paint-splattered overalls. Football hero Jake Wyler (Chris Evans) makes a bet that he can transform Janey into a gorgeous prom queen, a wager he may come to regret as he discovers Janey's true inner beauty. As their relationship blossoms, several other characters are limned, including a Nasty Cheerleader (Jaime Pressly), a Token Black Guy (Deon Richmond), a Stupid Fat Guy (Ron Lester), an Obsessed Best Friend (Eric Jungmann), an Undercover Reporter (Beverly Polcyn), the Cruelest Girl in School (Mia Kirshner), a Cocky Blonde Guy (Eric Christian Olsen), and several others. A nod to the multiple films that inspired it, Not Another Teen Movie (2001) was originally to have been entitled "Ten Things I Hate About Clueless Road Trips When I Can't Hardly Wait to Be Kissed."(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Miami Rhapsody</title>
    <desc lang="en">The discovery of marital troubles in her family causes a young woman to question her own upcoming nuptials in this clever romantic comedy. Sarah Jessica Parker stars as Gwyn, a bright, slightly neurotic advertising copywriter who is initially thrilled when her boyfriend Matt (Gil Bellows) finally proposes. Soon afterwards, however, she learns that her mother Nina (Mia Farrow) is indulging in an extra-marital affair with a handsome Latin stud (Antonio Banderas). This is only the first of several shocking revelations, as Gwyn soon learns of infidelity by her father (Paul Mazursky), brother (Kevin Pollack), and even newlywed sister (Carla Gugino). These indiscretions make Gwyn question the validity of the entire institution of marriage and doubt her own future. Director David Frankel, who also penned the screenplay, follows in the footsteps of Woody Allen in using introspective dialogue to detail the romantic troubles of a wealthy, neurotic Jewish family; practiced performances and a colorful use of Miami locations give the film its own personality(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Amazing Grace</title>
    <desc lang="en">One man's role in the long battle to outlaw slavery in the United Kingdom sets the stage for this historical drama from director Michael Apted. In 1784, 21-year-old William Wilberforce (Ioan Gruffudd) was elected to the British House of Commons, and soon established himself as a politician with a conscience. Several years later, his close friend William Pitt (Benedict Cumberbatch) became prime minister, and together they made a bold plan to introduce a bill banning slavery before the English legislature. Wilberforce was aided by anti-slavery activists Olaudah Equiano (Youssou N'Dour) and Thomas Clarkson (Rufus Sewell); however, pro-slavery hard-liners Lord Tarleton (Ciarán Hinds) and the Duke of Clarence (Toby Jones) spearheaded a hard-fought opposition to the legislation, and despite Wilberforce's best efforts, his bill went down in defeat. In 1797, Wilberforce left politics due to poor health and a battered spirit; staying at the country home of his friends Henry and Marianne Thornton (Nicholas Farrell and Sylvestra Le Touzel), he became acquainted with Barbara Spooner (Romola Garai), a beautiful woman with progressive views. Spooner became deeply infatuated with Wilberforce, and she encouraged him not to give up on his noble goals; with her help, Wilberforce launched a second campaign to persuade England's lawmakers to end the slave trade. Amazing Grace made its North American premiere as the closing-night gala attraction at the 2006 Toronto Film Festival(n)</desc>

His marriage to a fellow journalist having recently come to an end, Steve is wandering through Los Angeles' Skid Row when he notices a bedraggled figure playing a two-stringed violin. The figure in question is Ayers (Jamie Foxx), a man whose promising career in music was cut short due to a debilitating bout with mental illness. The more Lopez learns about Ayers, the greater his respect grows for the troubled soul. How could a man with such remarkable talent wind up living on the streets, and not be performing on-stage with a symphony orchestra? Later, as Lopez embarks on a quixotic quest to help Ayers pull his life together and launch a career in music, he gradually comes to realize that it is not Ayers whose life is being transformed, but his own(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">An embittered family man finds his childhood love of Christmas rekindled thanks to a generous gift from a mysterious stranger in this holiday drama for the entire family. Three decades after a childhood tragedy that destroyed his love of Christmas, cynical Michael Walker still loathes the sound of carols, and the sight of Old St. Nick. Try as his spirited wife (Connie Britton) and family might, they still can't get Michael into the holiday spirit. Meanwhile, as the snow begins to fall, misfortune strikes Michael's family, prompting the concerned father to reflect on his troubled past. Just when Michael's future looks to be teetering on the brink of disaster, however, a benevolent stranger (Willie Nelson) bestows his family a lavish new home under the one condition that they join in their new neighborhood's Christmas festivities. In the process, the man who forgot how to feel joy rediscovers that wide-eyed child who ran down the stairs every Christmas morning eager to see what Santa had left him under the tree. Kris Kristoferson and Lyle Lovett co-star(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Die Hard 2</title>
    <desc lang="en">"Another basement, another elevator...how can the same thing happen to the same guy twice?" asks John McClane (Bruce Willis), in what is doubtless the key question of this film. A year after foiling the terrorist takeover of a high-rise office building in the first movie, McClane is waiting to pick up his wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), at Dulles International Airport just outside Washington, D.C., on Christmas Eve. Scheduled to arrive the same evening is Ramon Esperanza (Franco Nero), a South American political figure who is being brought to the United States to stand trial for his role in a drug-smuggling ring. However, a group of terrorists, led by renegade American military officer Col. Stuart (William Sadler), take control of the airport, scuttling radio transmissions and placing their own men in the control tower. Stuart and his men ensure that Esperanza's plane lands safely, and then demand that Stuart and his men be given a fully-fueled 747 and free passage wherever they choose to go. Otherwise, they will guide the many circling jets waiting for landing instructions into definite crash landings, killing the many passengers on board. Not willing to stand aside as terrorists once again threaten his wife's life, the wise-cracking McClane once again leaps into action to foil Stuart's plans and bring the passenger jets safely to the ground. William Atherton, John Amos, Dennis Franz, and John Leguizamo highlight the supporting cast(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A group of disparate characters look for understanding and compassion in the midst of a lonely holiday season in this comedy drama. Rose (Susan Sarandon) is a middle-aged divorcée whose mother is in the hospital with an advanced case of Alzheimer's disease; while Rose wants one more chance to tell her mother that she loves her, the woman doesn't even know who she is anymore. Mike (Paul Walker) is a police officer who has become the obsessive focus of an elderly waiter, Artie (Alan Arkin), who is convinced Mike is the reincarnation of his late wife. Meanwhile, Mike is engaged to marry the beautiful Nina (Penélope Cruz), but he's so consumed with jealousy and suspicion that she's not sure if she can go through with the wedding. And Jules (Marcus Thomas) is a street hustler who has only one fond memory of Christmas -- ending up in an emergency room, where the staff was holding a party. Jules wants to relive the experience, and is even willing to injure himself to do so. Noel was the first directorial effort from actor and playwright Chazz Palminteri(n)</desc>

The first episode in Ken Burns' spectacular documentary of America's favorite pastime takes us from baseball's origins in the 1840s to the dawning of a new century, when glorious moments were captured in still photos rather than newsreel footage. Learn about the valuable contributions of Albert Goodwill Spaulding and Harry Wright, and recall some of the century's great players such as King Kelly, Cap Anson, and Cy Young. Burns highlights great teams like the Cincinnati Red Stockings and the Baltimore Orioles, and provides the background of those less glorious moments, when Moses Fleetwood Walker and all other Negroes were expelled from the major leagues. Also told is the story of John Montgomery Ward's efforts to establish a players' union. Ken Burns' Baseball: Inning 1 -- Our Game is a powerful and informative first inning for this classic baseball series(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Something Like a War. At the turn of the 20th century, Ken Burns' documentary homage to baseball history enters its "second inning." Baseball's first decade in the new century began with the creation of a new league, as "Ban" Johnson's unbending will -- along with the 500-dollar bonus he offered National League players to switch allegiances -- forced the American League into being. Detroit's Ty Cobb ruled the decade on the field while the Pirates' Honus Wagner, another possible contender for best player, was pushed to the sidelines. Other highlights of volume two in this nine-part series include the development of independent professional Negro teams, as well as the story of female semi-pro pitcher Alta Weiss(n)</desc>

This bio-picture stars Jackie Robinson and features his story of working his way through the Negro Leagues and entering Major League Baseball. Jackie Robinson shined in his career and established himself as a role model for other athletes that followed. This motion picture also stars the very talented Ruby Dee as Nancy Robinson(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This festive episode from 1996 finds the Craggy Island clerics and six other priests lost in what seems to be the world's largest lingerie department, with only Ted's quick thinking preventing the Catholic Church being rocked by a major scandal. His bravery earns him the coveted Golden Cleric award, which is when his troubles really begin. Comedy, starring Dermot Morgan, Ardal O'Hanlon and Frank Kelly.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Matt Lucas narrates another look back at TV shows from past decades, with clips and reactions to programmes from people not around to watch them at the time. This edition revisits the changing social attitudes reflected on the small screen in the 1960s, including humorous shows which took liberties in the name of satire, disability being mocked and bulletproof vests being put to the test on live TV. With contributions by Joan Bakewell, Peter Purves, Valerie Singleton and Melvyn Bragg.(n)</desc>

Initially focusing on insects, Attenborough meets a descendant of the dragonfly, before examining the Atlas beetle, which tends to restrict flight to times when it needs a mate or a fresh supply of food. More aesthetically pleasing is a group of beautiful tropical butterflies, followed by an in-depth study into the blow fly - the jet fighter of insects.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Cold Souls</title>
    <desc lang="en">Writer/director Sophie Barthes crafts this metaphysical tragicomedy, which straddles the line between reality and fantasy, set in a world where souls are extracted from humans and traded as commodites. Paul Giamatti is an anxious New Yorker who finds the answer to his deep-rooted malaise after stumbling upon an article about a high-tech company that claims to have found a solution to human suffering. By deep-freezing souls, claims the company, they can give their customers a life free from fear, doubt, and worry. Eager to free himself from the emotional burden of angst, Giamatti eagerly enlists their services. Trouble arises, however, when Giamatti's soul is swiped by a soul-trafficking "mule" who in turn gives it to a no-talent Russian soap opera actress. Now, in order to get back the soul that is rightfully his, Giamatti must make the arduous trip to St. Petersburg, along the way discovering that the true key to happiness isn't the absence of pain, but the ability to experience the entire spectrum of emotion and cherish the things that really matter(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Winter Passing</title>
    <desc lang="en">Money and emotions lead to a difficult reunion between a father and daughter in this drama. Reese Holden (Zooey Deschanel) is a struggling stage actress in New York City whose life has become an uphill struggle -- her career isn't giving her satisfaction, her relationship with would-be rock star Ray (Dallas Roberts) is stuck in neutral, an affair with her friend Rob (Robert Beitzel) brings no excitement, and her colleague Deirdre (Deirdre O'Connell) simply doesn't understand her problems. Reese is also short on money, which is why she's willing to listen to a proposal from a publisher who wants to release a series of love letters that her mother, a well-known author who died years ago, wrote to her father, Don (Ed Harris), another respected novelist who has fallen out of the limelight but is said to be working on a final major work. Having accepted an advance for the collection, Reese pays a visit to Don in Michigan to get his OK for the project and collect the letters, but discovers two strangers have moved in with Don -- Shelly (Amelia Warner), who studied under Don and has installed herself as his business manager, and Corbit (Will Ferrell), a neighborhood sad sack who helps with the housekeeping and runs errands for the reclusive writer. As Reese vies with Shelly for her father's attention, she struggles to come to terms with issues from her childhood and the dissatisfaction with her life. Winter Passing was written and directed by noted playwright Adam Rapp; it was his first feature film(n)</desc>

Upset at discovering that his ex-girlfriend is planning to move out of state with the couple's young son, Durell knows that the only way to keep his fractured family in close proximity to one another is to raise the 17,000 dollars needed to pay off her growing debt.

    <title lang="en">No</title>
    <desc lang="en">Gael García Bernal stars in Chilean director Pablo Larraín's third drama to probe the dark realities of life in his country under the brutal Pinochet regime. The Oscar-nominated No is as fascinating as the previous two works, though rather less immediately shocking and violent. It's 1988 and, after 15 years of his oppressive dictatorship, there's to be a referendum over whether Augusto Pinochet should stay in power for another eight years. Young advertising executive René Saavedra has agreed to produce the nightly 15-minute TV ads for the 'No' campaign. However, to the dismay of the anti-Pinochet lobby, he doesn't intend to air daily reminders of the brutality and atrocities Chile has had to endure. Instead, he aims to employ colourful, upbeat images and bright messages of a hopeful future to persuade the country to vote no. But, given the comfortable lives now lived by Chile's middle classes and the general air of cynicism around the referendum (which many see as a foregone conclusion), will it work? And what are Saavedra's real motives: democracy for his nation, or a chance to win back his estranged wife? Also starring Alfredo Castro as Saavedra's boss, who's running the ad campaign for the 'Yes' vote. In Spanish with English subtitles(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Hotel Rwanda</title>
    <desc lang="en">Terry George's moving, dramatic film is based on a true story from the Rwanda genocide of 1994. Don Cheadle plays Hutu Paul Rusesabagina, the manager of a four-star hotel in the capital Kigali, who's married to Tutsi Tatiana. When the Hutus start massacring Tutsis, he gives refuge to over 1000 Tutsis in the hotel and its grounds. At first, he uses the hotel's stock of beer, wine and spirits to bribe the marauding, murderous Hutu gangs. But as stocks run low, he must use all the diplomatic skills he learnt as a successful manager to save not just the lives of the Tutsis but his own and those of his family. The film also stars Nick Nolte as Col Oliver, a UN representative in the capital who finds himself impotent and without any support as the world abandons Rwanda's Tutsis to their terrible fate(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Emperor's Club</title>
    <desc lang="en">A dedicated teacher learns some important lessons about himself years after he retired from the classroom in this drama. William Hundert (Kevin Kline) is an instructor at St. Benedict's School for Boys, an exclusive private academy on the East Coast where Hundert drills his charges on the moral lessons to be learned through the study of Greek and Roman philosophers. Hundert is fond of telling his students, "A man's character is his fate," and he strives to impress upon them the importance of the ordered and examined life. In 1976, however, Hundert finds himself with an especially challenging group of students -- party-minded Fred Masoudi (Jesse Eisenberg) , introverted Martin Blythe (Paul Dano), bright but mischievous Deepak Mehta (Rishi Mehta), and most notably, openly rebellious Sedgewick Bell (Emile Hirsch). The son of a powerful politician, Bell pointedly runs against the current of Hundert's example, questioning the importance of the material, flouting the school's rules, talking out of turn in class, and devoting as much time to his interest in girls as in his studies. However, Hundert sees the possibility of great things in Bell, and encourages him to take part in the school's annual academic competition for the title of Mr. Julius Caesar. Hundert even goes so far as to bend the rules in scoring to favor Bell in the early stages of the contest, but his faith is betrayed when Bell is discovered cheating during the contest finals. Years later, Hundert is reunited with his students, where they learn the years have taught them all a great deal about their virtues and weaknesses. The Emperor's Club also features Harris Yulin, Rob Morrow, and Edward Herrmann(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A widowed Englishman working in Denmark and a Danish hairdresser who's been left by her husband forge a fragile romance during a trip to Italy to see their son and daughter get married. Philip (Pierce Brosnan) is a stern businessman who hates living in Denmark, and hasn't seen his son Patrick (Sebastian Jessen) in years. He's in a race to Patrick's wedding in Italy when he has a chance run-in with Ida (Trine Dyrholm) who's recovering from successful chemotherapy treatments when she learns that her husband Leif (Kim Bodnia) has been sleeping with a younger woman. Ida also happens to be the mother of Astrid (Molly Blixt Egelind), Patrick's beautiful bride-to-be. Though initially Philip and Ida appear to have nothing in common, their shared recognition that their children's union may be in trouble before the wedding bells have started to chime leads to an unexpected connection, and a second chance at happiness as they work to set things right.

Following a disastrous incident involving a Velcro jump suit at Milan Fashion Week, Brüno is fired from his TV show Funkyzeit mit Brüno, turns his back on the fashion, and heads off to America, hoping to become more famous than Hitler (though for different reasons, naturally). Once Stateside, his in-your-face uber-campness and total lack of self-awareness proceeds to shock, horrify and infuriate everyone he encounters - from a black TV audience, to whom he reveals his adopted African baby, via various homophobic bigots, to a memorable meeting with a Texan Congressman (who's probably still having nightmares about it). And, not willing to stop there, Brüno decides to jet off to the Middle East to solve the Arab/ Israeli conflict - to the utter horror of both parties, and risking injury or worse himself. Opinions are divided over whether Brüno is out to expose the idiocy of homophobia, or whether he's simply using it for laughs. However, there is consensus that this is a very, very funny film, albeit one not for the faint-hearted(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Caveman's Valentine</title>
    <desc lang="en">A man struggles back from madness to avenge the death of someone he knew in an intelligent thriller based on the acclaimed novel by George Dawes Green. Romulus Ledbetter (Samuel L. Jackson) once had a career as an acclaimed concert pianist, a position at the Juilliard School of Music, and a loving wife and children. But Ledbetter's life has been devastated by paranoid schizophrenia; now homeless, Ledbetter wanders the streets of New York City as he rails against Cornelius Gould Stuyvesant, a man whom he believes controls all the evil in the world while following his movements from a perch atop the Chrysler Building. Most nights, Ledbetter takes shelter in a cave in Central Park, earning him the nickname "the Caveman." One morning, Ledbetter discovers a frozen corpse caught in the branches of a tree near his cave; the body is that of Scotty (Sean MacMahaon), a homeless drug addict who was close friends with his pal Matthew (Rodney Eastman). Ledbetter is determined to get justice for Scotty, and he's also eager to prove himself to his daughter Lulu (Aunjanue Ellis), now a New York City police officer. While Ledbetter is at first convinced that his nemesis Stuyvesant is responsible for Scotty's death, in time he focuses on another suspect: David Leppenraub (Colm Feore), a famous photographer known for his controversial erotic images of young men, who occasionally hired Scotty as a model. As Ledbetter attempts to investigate Leppenraub's possible role in the murder, he soon gains an unexpected ally -- Moira (Ann Magnuson), a noted sculptor and Leppenraub's sister. The Caveman's Valentine marked the major-studio debut for director Kasi Lemmons, who made an impressive debut in 1997 with the independent drama Eve's Bayou(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Which Way Is Up?</title>
    <desc lang="en">This Americanized remake of Lina Wertmuller's The Seduction of Mimi offered audiences the novelty of seeing Richard Pryor performing three different roles in the same film. Which Way Is Up? tells the tale of Leroy Jones (Pryor), a poor orange picker who gets fired from his job when he accidentally joins a worker's union during a demonstration. He is forced to travel to Los Angeles and abandon his family, which includes his wife, Annie Mae (Margaret Avery), and his perpetually randy father, Rufus (also Pryor). While there, he falls in love with labor organizer Vanetta (Lonette McKee), but is soon rehired by his former employers when they realize he is easily manipulated. Back home, Leroy discovers his new managerial role alienates him from his former friends as he tries to divide his time between Annie Mae and Vanetta. When he discovers Annie Mae has been impregnated by the Reverend Lennox Thomas (Pryor's 3rd role) during his absence, Leroy sets his sights on seducing Lennox's wife. The resulting film had ambition to spare, but was generally panned as an inferior remake by the critics and failed to find a mass audience. However, Which Way Is Up? gained a second lease on life via cable and home video and has become a cult favorite with Pryor's fans(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">In the Mix</title>
    <desc lang="en">R&amp;B star Usher Raymond plays his first starring role in this story which blends crime with romantic comedy. Darrell (Usher Raymond) is a successful club DJ who one night unexpectedly rescues a woman from a dangerous situation. It turns out the woman in question is the wife of Frank Pacelli (Chazz Palminteri), one of New York City's most powerful mobsters. To show his appreciation, Pacelli gives Darrell a job -- serving as bodyguard for this beautiful daughter, Dolly (Emmanuelle Chriqui). A short-lived romance blooms between Darrell and Dolly, but it isn't long before the couple are quarreling, which makes Pacelli more than a bit unhappy with his new hire. However, Pacelli also has a mob war and a disloyal and ambitious young lieutenant to deal with, and Darrell soon finds Pacelli's problems become his problems too. Also starring Kevin Hart and Robert Davi, In the Mix was produced under the title Dying for Dolly(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Golden Compass</title>
    <desc lang="en">Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig and Dakota Blue Richards star in Chris Weitz's family fantasy-adventure, based on the first book in Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy. Twelve-year-old orphan Lyra Belacqua lives in an Oxford college, where the academic and domestic staff do their best to push her enquiring mind down conventional educational routes and quell her tomboy tendencies; it's a losing battle. One day, having sneaked into a private meeting of the college's dons, Lyra learns of mysterious events taking place in the Arctic. Soon after, amid news of mysterious child abductors called the 'Gobblers', her best friend Roger vanishes. The fearless Lyra sets off, determined to rescue her playmate. But Lyra's is a parallel universe: one with VIctorian-style technology; where people's souls take the form of character-suggesting visible animals; witches and talking, armoured polar bears rule the cold lands of the north; and an organisation called The Magisterium aims to assert its authority over everyone. Lyra's journey will prove a dangerous one; one that uncovers the terrible truth that links the Gobblers and the Arctic phenomenon she heard about in the safety of Oxford. Also starring Eva Green, and the voices of Freddie Highmore and Ian McKellan. Sadly, it now looks as though the following two films in the series are fated not to be made. Even so, this stands as a stirring, thoughtful family adventure that's reasonably true to Pullman's masterpiece(n)</desc>

But Lyra's is a parallel universe: one with VIctorian-style technology; where people's souls take the form of character-suggesting visible animals; witches and talking, armoured polar bears rule the cold lands of the north; and an organisation called The Magisterium aims to assert its authority over everyone. Lyra's journey will prove a dangerous one; one that uncovers the terrible truth that links the Gobblers and the Arctic phenomenon she heard about in the safety of Oxford. Also starring Eva Green, and the voices of Freddie Highmore and Ian McKellan. Sadly, it now looks as though the following two films in the series are fated not to be made. Even so, this stands as a stirring, thoughtful family adventure that's reasonably true to Pullman's masterpiece(n)</desc>

Wearing thick "age" makeup, Albert Salmi stars as ruthless millionaire Feathersmith, who would give anything to relive his carefree youth. Enter Miss Devlin (Julie Newmar) -- actually the Devil, but a very shapely Devil -- who offers to strike a deal with the decrepit tycoon. Curiously, Devlin doesn't want Feathersmith's soul (which he had already lost several years earlier), but she will settle for cold, hard cash. Another cautionary "Be Careful What You Wish For" yarn, "Of Late I Think of Cliffordville" originally aired April 11, 1963(n)</desc>
