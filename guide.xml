    <desc lang="en">Academy Award-winning screenwriter John Patrick Shanley's first foray into the director's chair is a quirky romantic fantasy, featuring Bo Welch's signature production design. Tom Hanks plays Joe Banks, a man who hates his job, thinks the overhead fluorescent lights are making him sick, and quakes at the presence of his boorish boss Frank Watori (Dan Hedaya). He is attracted to the office secretary DeDe (Meg Ryan) but is afraid to speak to her. Then his life changes when he visits Dr. Ellison (Robert Stack). Dr. Ellison tells Joe that he has something called "a brain cloud" that is rapidly spreading throughout his brain. He will feel great, but he'll be dead within five months. Instead of being depressed at this bleak prognosis, Joe suddenly feels free. He quits his job, asks DeDe out, and is contacted by a rich millionaire named Graynamore (Lloyd Bridges). Graynamore owns an island named Waponi Woo, whose natives need to be placated. The natives require a sacrifice to their island volcano, the Big Woo, so that the island won't sink beneath the Pacific. Graynamore offers unlimited wealth to Tom in exchange for Tom's becoming the object of human sacrifice. Joe has nothing to lose, so he accepts the offer. As he heads out to the island, Joe meets Graynamore's daughters -- Angelica, a Los Angeles socialite, and Patricia, Angelica's blonde half-sister (both roles played by Ryan). Joe arrives at the island, and as he stands at the lips of the Big Woo he has to decide whether he really wants to leap into the maw of the fiery volcano(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The World According to Garp</title>
    <desc lang="en">The 1982 film version of the John Irving novel The World According to Garp attempts to captures the quirky spirit while condensing the Irving original. Robin Williams plays the title character, the son of unmarried, unorthodox feminist Jenny Fields (Glenn Close, in her film debut). Every effort made by Jenny to broaden Garp's outlook on life -- she even arranges for him to spend the night with a hooker (Swoosie Kurtz) -- crams more fears and phobias into his psyche. Aspiring to become a novelist, Garp succeeds in this goal at the same time that his mother publishes her first feminist manifesto. Though successful and happily married to college sweetheart Helen Holm (Mary Beth Hurt), Garp remains envious of his fearless mother, who has taken in the radical "Ellen Jamesians," a group named after a young woman who had her tongue cut out by a rapist. Mutilation, in fact, becomes something of a leitmotif in Garp's life, climaxing (in every sense of the word) in an auto accident brought about by Helen's tryst with Michael Milton (Mark Soper). There is, of course, much more to the story than this: standing out amongst the dozens of offbeat supporting characters is John Lithgow as Roberta Muldoon, a transexual ex-football jock. John Irving appears as a referee during a college wrestling match, while director George Roy Hill plays the pilot whose low-flying plane crashes into Garp's new home. The World According to Garp didn't attract as large an audience as other, more conventional Robin Williams vehicles, though Close and Lithgow would both be nominated for Best Supporting Actor statues(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Who Wants to Be a Millionaire</title>
    <desc lang="en">Although the once-hot game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? had lost its luster as a prime-time ABC offering, the producers felt that there was enough life left in the property to warrant a Monday-through-Friday syndicated version. Taking over from the earlier series' host Regis Philbin was Meredith Vieira of The View. To make certain that the series would not be bankrupted after its first week on the air, the questions posed to contestants were considerably harder than those on the prime-time incarnation. Also, the famous "fastest finger" round was eliminated, taking some of the pressure off the contestants when they struggled to come up with answers. The most noteworthy change from the original version was the absence of Regis Philbin's familiar catchphrases: One would never hear Meredith Vieira chime in with the legendary "Is that your final answer?" The syndicated Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? was launched on September 16, 2002(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The veteran rocker invites Alan Yentob to his LA home to conduct an interview, in which Stewart looks back on a career spanning more than 50 years. He discusses working with acts like the Steampacket and Jeff Beck in the 1960s and his time with the Faces, whose offstage antics became legendary - as did the frontman's affairs with a string of famous women. His solo career propelled him to superstardom with songs such as Maggie May and Sailing, and while the 1980s proved to be less successful, his constant reinvention has given him a lasting career. Having more recently become known as a singer of American standards, he talks about recording Time, his first album of new material in almost 20 years.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Richard Hammond presents this chilly version of Total Wipeout, which sees the contestants wrapping up warm to tackle a snow-covered course with winter-themed obstacles and seasonal challenges. They must manoeuvre themselves past Granny's House, watching out for the angry dog nipping at their ankles and a front door guaranteed to smack them in the face. They then cling onto the ski lift to avoid plunging into the icy waters, before riding the conveyor belt that throws them onto those old Wipeout favourites, the big red balls. Amanda Byram laughs it up at the side of the course.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Adele Story</title>
    <desc lang="en">Documentary charting the remarkable career trajectory of Adele Adkins, the pop and soul singer who rose from humble beginnings in Tottenham to become one of the biggest stars of the modern music industry. Now popular enough to warrant going by her forename only, Adele's interest in music was encouraged by her mother from an early age. Winning a place at the Brit School in Croydon, Adele first shot into the public eye when her friend uploaded a demo to MySpace in 2006, and by the time she graduated, the singer had already secured a record deal. What followed were three hugely successful albums, 19, 21 and 25, each of which surpassed the last in terms of critical acclaim and sales figures. Adele also scored an Oscar in 2013 for her song Skyfall, which featured as the theme of the James Bond film of the same name.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Blood and Wine</title>
    <desc lang="en">Jack Nicholson reunited with director Bob Rafelson, director of Five Easy Pieces and The King Of Marvin Gardens, for this violent, downbeat crime drama. Alex (Jack Nicholson) is a wine dealer whose business is going belly-up, along with his life. His step-son Jason (Stephen Dorff) hates him, his wife Suzanne (Judy Davis) has a drinking problem and is the constant target of Alex's abuse, and Alex is having an affair with Gabriella (Jennifer Lopez), a domestic worker from Cuba. One of the people that Gabriella cleans for has a diamond necklace worth several million dollars locked in a safe in a bedroom. Desperate for a quick score to get himself out of debt, Alex sees a opportunity for a lot of fast money and hooks up with Victor (Michael Caine), a career criminal who knows how to open safes but is desperately ill with tuberculosis. Nicholson and Rafelson first worked together on the film Head, starring The Monkees (Nicholson only had a bit part, but he also wrote the screenplay and was credited with producing the soundtrack album)(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Free to Murder Again. The Texas penal system wakes up from a nightmare in the A&amp;E program American Justice: Free to Murder Again. The subject of the documentary is serial killer Kenneth McDuff, the biggest mistake the parole board ever made. McDuff was first sentenced to death in 1968 for killing three teenagers. Seemingly, his incarceration meant the end of his murder spree. But due to the overcrowding of Texas jails, McDuff was eventually released after serving only 21 years. Soon, the criminal was back on the streets harassing children and adults alike.

    <desc lang="en">Clare Balding travels to South Africa to join a veterinary team trying to help a rhino called Thandi who was attacked by poachers for her horn. For the first time, a plastic surgeon will attempt a skin graft on the animal to heal the wound. She also visits the rainforest of Borneo to follow the story of an orangutan who needs cataracts removing from her eyes so that she can be released back into the wild. Elsewhere, vet Steve Leonard takes a trip to Chicago's Lincoln Park Zoo, where the latest technology is being used to help chimpanzees with heart disease. He also visits the South African city of Pretoria, where a Cape fur seal requires a CT scan to identify the root cause of her illness, and a giraffe urgently needs to be anaesthetised to treat a leg injury.(n)</desc>

Seen on the NBC-owned stations in the larger markets, Whacked Out Sports was initially broadcast on September 7, 2006(n)</desc>

While young Bart Simpson (voice of Nancy Cartwright) hasn't had much use for girls in the past, he begins to change his mind about the fairer sex when he meets Laura Powers (voice of Sara Gilbert), the daughter of a divorcée who has moved into the neighborhood. Laura is the perfect girl for Bart -- she's pretty, she knows how to put bullies in their place, and she's hip to such pranks as the "Wet Willie" and the "Hertz Doughnut." However, she's also about five years older than Bart, which makes it hard for her to take him seriously as potential boyfriend material, though he makes a good impression (for a change) when she comes over to babysit. Bart is convinced he's found true love, until Laura informs him she has a boyfriend -- Jimbo Jones (voice of Pamela Hayden), one of Springfield's more obnoxious thugs-in-training. Bart isn't about to take this lying down and plots his revenge against Jimbo. Meanwhile, Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) takes Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) to local seafood restaurant The Frying Dutchman when he hears they have an "all you can eat" buffet; however, the restaurant's management cuts Homer off after eating most of their stock on hand, and Homer decides to take the matter to court with the help of semi-qualified attorney Lionel Hutz (voice of Phil Hartman).

    <desc lang="en">Estranged from his parents by circumstance and nudged toward a foster family, a young boy seeks out his long-lost folks and discovers prodigious musical talent in this family-oriented drama from Disco Pigs director Kirsten Sheridan. In the aftermath of a passionate night together above New York's Washington Square, a charismatic Irish guitarist named Louis (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) and a reserved cellist named Lyla (Keri Russell) are forced apart by fate. Despite the fact that they do not remain together, however, their fleeting union has created something amazing that neither could have ever anticipated -- a baby. Unfortunately, just after the child's birth, the mother is misinformed that the infant has died. Cut to 11 years later, when the child, Evan, is living in a Gotham-area boys' home and has developed an acute ability to listen to the sounds of the outside world -- hoping against all hope that his biological mother and father will turn up to claim him, while those in charge try to encourage him to open himself up to the possibility of adoption. Unduly rejecting these bids, Evan runs away into the city. Out on the streets, the child falls into the clutches of a manipulative, untrustworthy street person named Wizard (Robin Williams), who renames Evan "August Rush" and opens the boy up to the depth and breadth of his own musical talent even as he smells the opportunity to grow rich off of the foundling. Meanwhile, Evan/August's hope persists that he will be reunited with his folks, and Louis and Lyla, unable to forget their initial night of love, feel themselves being drawn back together by fate(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">August Rush</title>
    <desc lang="en">Estranged from his parents by circumstance and nudged toward a foster family, a young boy seeks out his long-lost folks and discovers prodigious musical talent in this family-oriented drama from Disco Pigs director Kirsten Sheridan. In the aftermath of a passionate night together above New York's Washington Square, a charismatic Irish guitarist named Louis (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) and a reserved cellist named Lyla (Keri Russell) are forced apart by fate. Despite the fact that they do not remain together, however, their fleeting union has created something amazing that neither could have ever anticipated -- a baby. Unfortunately, just after the child's birth, the mother is misinformed that the infant has died. Cut to 11 years later, when the child, Evan, is living in a Gotham-area boys' home and has developed an acute ability to listen to the sounds of the outside world -- hoping against all hope that his biological mother and father will turn up to claim him, while those in charge try to encourage him to open himself up to the possibility of adoption. Unduly rejecting these bids, Evan runs away into the city. Out on the streets, the child falls into the clutches of a manipulative, untrustworthy street person named Wizard (Robin Williams), who renames Evan "August Rush" and opens the boy up to the depth and breadth of his own musical talent even as he smells the opportunity to grow rich off of the foundling. Meanwhile, Evan/August's hope persists that he will be reunited with his folks, and Louis and Lyla, unable to forget their initial night of love, feel themselves being drawn back together by fate(n)</desc>

Today, Dre runs a successful record label, and Sidney is a respected music journalist; both have managed to turn their love for the music into careers, and both are still close friends. Close enough, in fact, that many of their pals wonder why they've never become boyfriend and girlfriend. While both have always denied their attraction to one another, Sidney begins to have second thoughts when Dre proposes to his girlfriend Reese (Nicole Ari Parker), a lawyer. Even though Sidney has a relationship of her own with professional basketball player Kelby (Boris Kodjoe), as Dre's wedding draws closer, Sidney begins to suspect that her longtime best friend is actually the love of her life. Brown Sugar features supporting performances form real life Hip Hop stars Mos Def and Queen Latifah; former basketball star Earvin "Magic" Johnson served as executive producer(n)</desc>

But much later, Jack has become an urban Wall Street exec with no wife or family of his own, and a mysterious proxy (Don Cheadle) offers him the opportunity to step into the life he left behind. After falling asleep in his posh New York apartment, Jack awakens to find himself in bed with his now-wife Kate, daughter Annie (Makenzie Vega), and a new baby, none of which he has ever experienced in his fast-paced single life. After discovering his "real" life has been eliminated, he begrudgingly tries to fit in with his newly appointed life as a family man. The Family Man also stars Saul Rubinek and Jeremy Piven(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Coraline</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Henry Selick (The Nightmare Before Christmas; James and the Giant Peach) delivers a deliciously dark stop-motion animated adventure for children who don't mind a scare or two, based on Neil Gaiman's much-praised book. Coraline Jones and her parents have just moved into the Pink Palaces Apartments in Oregon, where they find themselves surrounded by eccentric neighbours, including a pair of ageing burlesque performers. It should be an exciting time, but Coraline's parents are too busy as horticultural journalists to spend any time with her, so she is deeply bored. That is until she discovers a mysterious door that only appears after dark. Bold and inquisitive, the youngster investigates. She discovers a brightly coloured alternative universe, where her 'Other Mother' has plenty of time to play with her and her neighbours' quirks are charmingly exaggerated; in fact, she's tempted to stay. But all is not as it seems: everyone in the new world has buttons for eyes - and the operation to install them involves knitting needles. And that revelation is just the first of her shocking discoveries about the true nature of her apparent idyll... So, there's definitely good reason for that PG certificate, though children who can cope with the story of Hansel and Gretel shouldn't find anything too disturbing here. Selick's film won great critical acclaim, and scooped festival prizes around the world, as well as picking up an Oscar nomination and winning the 2009 BAFTA Children's Award(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker</title>
    <desc lang="en">The young protégé of one of the world's greatest superheroes has his first encounter with an old nemesis in this direct-to-video feature adapted from the popular animated series Batman Beyond. Terry McGinnis (Will Friedle) has taken over the crime-fighting responsibilities of Batman from aging Bruce Wayne (Kevin Conroy), but while Terry has learned a great deal from Wayne, he's never heard the startling truth about Batman's final encounter with his arch-enemy, The Joker (Mark Hamill). However, when The Joker returns to Gotham City as vicious as ever, Wayne decides that it's time that the new Batman learned all there is to know about the green-faced terror before he can bring the city to its knees -- especially after Bruce is attacked by his one-time rival. Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker also features the voice talents of Melissa Joan Hart and Angie Harmon. Upon its initial release, the movie sparked some controversy among Batman Beyond fans because of last-minute edits that toned down the violence level. However, it was eventually released on DVD in an uncut format(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Coraline</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Henry Selick (The Nightmare Before Christmas; James and the Giant Peach) delivers a deliciously dark stop-motion animated adventure for children who don't mind a scare or two, based on Neil Gaiman's much-praised book. Coraline Jones and her parents have just moved into the Pink Palaces Apartments in Oregon, where they find themselves surrounded by eccentric neighbours, including a pair of ageing burlesque performers. It should be an exciting time, but Coraline's parents are too busy as horticultural journalists to spend any time with her, so she is deeply bored. That is until she discovers a mysterious door that only appears after dark. Bold and inquisitive, the youngster investigates. She discovers a brightly coloured alternative universe, where her 'Other Mother' has plenty of time to play with her and her neighbours' quirks are charmingly exaggerated; in fact, she's tempted to stay. But all is not as it seems: everyone in the new world has buttons for eyes - and the operation to install them involves knitting needles. And that revelation is just the first of her shocking discoveries about the true nature of her apparent idyll... So, there's definitely good reason for that PG certificate, though children who can cope with the story of Hansel and Gretel shouldn't find anything too disturbing here. Selick's film won great critical acclaim, and scooped festival prizes around the world, as well as picking up an Oscar nomination and winning the 2009 BAFTA Children's Award(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Actress and writer Nia Vardalos, who became an overnight sensation with My Big Fat Greek Wedding, returns to the big screen with this gender-bending comedy. Connie (Vardalos) and Carla (Toni Collette) are best friends who've shared the same dream ever since they were teenagers -- making a name for themselves in the musical theater. However, after years of treading water on Chicago's dinner theater circuit and playing bottom-of-the-barrel nightclubs, the two are facing middle age with minimal career success. One evening after a performance, Connie and Carla have the misfortune of witnessing the murder of nightclub owner Frank (Michael Roberds) by low-level Mafiosi; the gals are seen by the shooters, and they hit the road in fear for their lives. Connie and Carla end up in Los Angeles, where they struggle to create new identities for themselves. After witnessing a drag review at a nightclub, they realize that even they have more talent than most of the men performing that evening, and they decide to pose as female impersonators in hopes of landing a gig. Connie and Carla's new act is an immediate hit, and soon they're the toast of L.A.'s gay community. But the women discover it's difficult to keep on fooling people into believing they're men, and things become even more complicated when the Mobsters discover that Connie and Carla are in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, Connie finds herself falling for Jeff (David Duchovny), a regular guy looking for his cross-dressing brother who can't understand why he's developing a crush on a drag queen(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Michael Clayton</title>
    <desc lang="en">Michael Clayton (George Clooney) handles all of the dirty work for a major New York law firm, arranging top-flight legal services and skirting through loopholes for ethically questionable clients. But when a fellow "fixer" decides to turn on the very firm they were hired to clean up for, Clayton finds himself at the center of a conspiratorial maelstrom. Once an ambitious D.A., Clayton is now a shell of his former dynamic self, thanks to a divorce, an unfortunate business venture, and astronomical debt. Though he longs to leave the cutthroat, ethically dubious world of corporate law behind, Clayton's poor financial situation and devotion to firm head Marty Bach (Sydney Pollack) leave him little choice but to remain on the job and tough it out. Meanwhile, litigator Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton) finds her entire company's future hinging on the outcome of a multi-billion-dollar settlement overseen by Clayton's friend, star lawyer Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson). When Edens snaps and decides to blow the whistle on the questionable case, sabotaging the defense, Clayton must decide between his loyalty and his conscience(n)</desc>

Parker's eponymous detective. Having recently settled into his position as the police chief of Paradise, Massachusetts, Stone is troubled to learn that the body of a former straight-A student has been found floating in a nearby lake. Later, as Stone delves ever deeper into the case, he finds that the girl had grown increasingly self-destructive in her last days and that her parents hadn't even bothered to report her missing. His investigation around the quiet New England town yielding little to go on, Stone ventures into the city to search for clues and has a frightening brush with the Boston mob. With every inquiry Stone makes, he appears to be moving farther away from the truth than ever before. Though a disturbing instance of explosive domestic violence momentarily distracts the detective from the task at hand, Stone's determination quickly turns to obsession when he begins to feel as if he may finally be on track to solving the case(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Denzel Washington delivers an Academy Award-winning performance opposite Ethan Hawke in this gritty drama set in the morally ambiguous world of undercover police work. Every day a war rages between drug dealers and cops on the streets of America's inner cities. With every war come casualties, none greater than 13-year veteran Los Angeles narcotics officer Alonzo Harris (Washington), whose questionable methods blur the line between legal and corrupt. Today Alonzo gets a new partner, idealistic rookie Jake Hoyt (Hawke), and Jake has one day--and one day only--to prove his mettle to his fiercely charismatic superior. Over 24 hours, Jake will be dragged into the ethical mire of Alonzo's logic as both men risk their careers and their lives to serve conflicting notions of justice. Starring Denzel Washington, Ethan Hawke &amp; Macy Gray(n)</desc>

In an extraordinary turn of events, further work on the Liverpool Street station has revealed another burial ground, this time accommodating the capital's radicals, rebels and outsiders. The Bedlam burial ground, which is thought to be the final resting place of nearly 20,000 people, was believed to be lost for around 300 years. Now, with the excavation process under way, archaeologists and historians have been using bone analysis techniques in conjunction with parish records to reveal the names and life stories of those whose remains were found on-site. Their research reveals that people came from as far afield as Africa to work in the English capital, and sheds light on how pollution first became one of the city's most prolific killers.(n)</desc>

More than 150 years after Charles Darwin formulated his ground-breaking theory of evolution on the remote archipelago, Attenborough explains how life on the islands has continued to evolve in biological isolation, examining how the ever-changing volcanic landscape has given birth to species and sub-species that exist nowhere else in the world. He begins by revealing how Galapagos rose from the ocean four million years ago.(n)</desc>

One potential partner to steer well clear of, however, is the praying mantis, the female of which is notorious for eating the male just after - or even during - mating.

However, the harvestman spider has no use for sex at all, and reproduces by cloning itself.(n)</desc>

Susan (Blanchard Ryan) and Daniel (Daniel Travis) are a busy married couple on an island vacation. They board a vessel called the Reef Explorer with a group of other scuba divers, traveling 15 miles out to sea. Since they are certified to dive in open waters, the couple breaks off from the group to go exploring. The Reef Explorer accidentally leaves without a proper head count, leaving them stranded in shark-infested waters. Kentis and producer wife Laura Lau did all the filming themselves in the actual ocean without extraneous special effects, while the actors wore special steel-mesh under their wetsuits in the scenes where actual sharks were involved. Open Water was shown at the Sundance Film Festival in 2004 as part of the American Spectrum competition(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Money and emotions lead to a difficult reunion between a father and daughter in this drama. Reese Holden (Zooey Deschanel) is a struggling stage actress in New York City whose life has become an uphill struggle -- her career isn't giving her satisfaction, her relationship with would-be rock star Ray (Dallas Roberts) is stuck in neutral, an affair with her friend Rob (Robert Beitzel) brings no excitement, and her colleague Deirdre (Deirdre O'Connell) simply doesn't understand her problems. Reese is also short on money, which is why she's willing to listen to a proposal from a publisher who wants to release a series of love letters that her mother, a well-known author who died years ago, wrote to her father, Don (Ed Harris), another respected novelist who has fallen out of the limelight but is said to be working on a final major work. Having accepted an advance for the collection, Reese pays a visit to Don in Michigan to get his OK for the project and collect the letters, but discovers two strangers have moved in with Don -- Shelly (Amelia Warner), who studied under Don and has installed herself as his business manager, and Corbit (Will Ferrell), a neighborhood sad sack who helps with the housekeeping and runs errands for the reclusive writer. As Reese vies with Shelly for her father's attention, she struggles to come to terms with issues from her childhood and the dissatisfaction with her life. Winter Passing was written and directed by noted playwright Adam Rapp; it was his first feature film(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Good Morning, Vietnam</title>
    <desc lang="en">The film begins in 1965, when disc jockey Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams) is assigned to take over the AFR's Saigon radio broadcasts. In contrast to the dull, by-rote announcers that have preceded him, Cronauer is a bundle of dynamite, heralding each broadcast with a loud "Goooooood morning, Vietnaaaaam," playing whatever records tickle his fancy (even those not officially sanctioned by his hidebound superiors), and indulging in wild flights of improvisational fancy. Cronauer's immediate superior Lt. Hauk (Bruno Kirby), whose own notions of humor are puerile and pathetic, jealously attempts to dethrone Vietnam's favorite rock jock. Fortunately, Cronauer's popularity is such that he enjoys the full protection of the higher-ups. But when Cronauer, after experiencing the horrors of war first-hand, insists upon telling his listeners the truth instead of the official government line, he is instantly replaced by the unfunny Hauk and must struggle to get back on the air(n)</desc>

Chuckie (voice of Christine Cavanaugh) has been fretting over his father Chas (voice of Michael Bell) and his status as a single father, as he wants to have a mommy like all of his friends. Chas and his father Stu (voice of Jack Riley) were hired to create a bevy of electronic critters for the newly opened Euro-Reptarland theme park, but the robots are acting up, and park manager Coco La Bouche (Susan Sarandon) is hopping mad. So Stu and Chas are flown to Paris to do some repairs, with Chas bringing Chuckie and all his friends along. Their visit to the City of Lights proves to be one adventure after another, as Chuckie tries to find a suitable mother (with Coco leading the pack) and Tommy (voice of Elizabeth Dailey) somehow gets behind the wheel of the giant Reptar robot. Rugrats in Paris: The Movie features original songs from T-Boz from TLC, The Baha Men, and Mylene Farmer, while John Lithgow, Debbie Reynolds, and Mako contribute to the voice cast(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Gerard Butler stars in Marc Forster's violent, fact-based drama about a substance-addicted criminal who finds God and relocates to Sudan to offer his own idiosyncratic brand of Christian charity. The film initially portrays Sam Childers as being a far from nice man: a misogynistic biker whose life is steeped in crime, narcotics and violence, and who quickly returns to armed robbery almost as soon as he's released from jail. But while he was inside, his wife Lynn found Jesus, and, after Sam gets stabbed, she urges him to join her at church. Sam subsequently has his own Damascene moment and starts life afresh, founding his own (legitimate) construction company. Before long he has also built his own church. But it's only after a trip to Sudan, where he witnesses the devastation wrought by the marauding Lord's Resistance Army, that he truly becomes driven. Relocating to the African country, he sets up a faith-based centre to care for victims of the LRA's violence and rape. And also takes up arms to literally fight the good fight... Also starring Michael Shannon(n)</desc>

Waters and his men find Kendricks, but she refuses to leave with them unless she can bring along 70 refugees who have been left to her care. Kendricks makes it clear that if they are left behind, the refugees will face certain death, but Waters's C.O. insists he bring back Kendricks -- but not her patients. Forced by his conscience to disobey orders, Waters and his team race against time to escort the refugees to a border town where they will find safe haven before invading troops can ambush them.

    <title lang="en">Glory</title>
    <desc lang="en">Glory is a celebration of a little-known act of mass courage during the Civil War. Simply put, the heroes involved have been ignored by history due to racism. Those heroes were the all-black members of the 54th Regiment of the Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, headed by Col. Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick), the son of an influential abolitionist (played by an uncredited Jane Alexander). Despite the fact that the Civil War is ostensibly being fought on their behalf, the black soldiers are denied virtually every privilege and amenity that is matter of course for their white counterparts; as in armies past and future, they are given the most menial and demeaning of tasks. Still, none of the soldiers quit the regiment when given the chance. The unofficial leaders of the group are gravedigger John Rawlins (Morgan Freeman) and fugitive slave Trip (Denzel Washington), respectively representing the brains and heart of the organization. The 54th acquit themselves valiantly at Fort Wagner, SC, charging a fortification manned by some 1,000 Confederates. Glory was based on Lincoln Kirstein's Lay This Laurel and Peter Burchard's One Gallant Rush; the latter book was founded on the letters of Col. Robert Gould Shaw, the real-life character played by Matthew Broderick. The film won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for co-star Denzel Washington, and additional statuettes for Best Cinematography (Freddie Francis) and Sound Recording(n)</desc>

Simon (Bill Paxton) seduces Helen with the lie that he is a secret agent; he's really a used car salesman. Harry suspects that Helen is cheating on him, and he sends a few colleagues to kidnap them. Helen then discovers that Harry is a secret agent by night, working for a shadowy group called the Omega Sector. Harry and his partner Gib (Tom Arnold) are trying to find four nuclear warheads that have disappeared from a former Soviet republic(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Glory</title>
    <desc lang="en">Glory is a celebration of a little-known act of mass courage during the Civil War. Simply put, the heroes involved have been ignored by history due to racism. Those heroes were the all-black members of the 54th Regiment of the Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, headed by Col. Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick), the son of an influential abolitionist (played by an uncredited Jane Alexander). Despite the fact that the Civil War is ostensibly being fought on their behalf, the black soldiers are denied virtually every privilege and amenity that is matter of course for their white counterparts; as in armies past and future, they are given the most menial and demeaning of tasks. Still, none of the soldiers quit the regiment when given the chance. The unofficial leaders of the group are gravedigger John Rawlins (Morgan Freeman) and fugitive slave Trip (Denzel Washington), respectively representing the brains and heart of the organization. The 54th acquit themselves valiantly at Fort Wagner, SC, charging a fortification manned by some 1,000 Confederates. Glory was based on Lincoln Kirstein's Lay This Laurel and Peter Burchard's One Gallant Rush; the latter book was founded on the letters of Col. Robert Gould Shaw, the real-life character played by Matthew Broderick. The film won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for co-star Denzel Washington, and additional statuettes for Best Cinematography (Freddie Francis) and Sound Recording(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Volver</title>
    <desc lang="en">Two sisters learn that the bonds of family don't always end after death in this gentle observational comedy drama that marks celebrated Spanish filmmaker Pedro Almodóvar's 16th feature. The story explores the interactions between three generations of women in a Spanish family. Raimunda (Penélope Cruz) was born and raised in the apocryphal village of Alcanfor de las Infantas, in La Mancha, Spain. However, she now resides in Madrid, where she works as a janitor. She is married to Paco (Antonio de la Torre), an unemployed layabout, and looks after her daughter, Paula (Yohana Cobo). Raimunda's mother, Irene (Carmen Maura), died several years back (along with her father) in a house fire. Raimunda's younger sister, Sole (Lola Dueñas), also lives in Madrid and works as a hair stylist, while their aunt Paula (Chus Lampreave) still makes her home in La Mancha, with occasional help from neighbor Agustina (Blanca Portillo). The story takes an unusual and mystical twist when Agustina mentions that Irene has begun reappearing in ghostly form -- a fact questioned by Raimunda and Sole. After a murder and an unexpected family tragedy, Paula's story is indeed corroborated by the appearance of Irene's spirit (who has come to comfort her family), and Sole must decide how to respond to the long-dead mother's strange, enchanting presence(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Based on the novel by John Katzenbach, author of Just Cause (1995), this prison camp drama combines elements of A Soldier's Story (1984) and the classic Stalag 17 (1953). Colin Farrell stars as Lt. Tommy Hart, a second-year Harvard Law School student who enlists to fight in World War II but ends up being taken prisoner by the Germans. When a murder at the Nazi-run Stalag Luft 13 leaves a black Tuskegee airman named Lt. Lincoln Scott (Terrence Dashon Howard) accused of the crime, high-ranking prisoner (and fourth-generation war hero) Col. William McNamara (Bruce Willis) persuades camp commandant Col. Werner Visser (Marcel Iures) to allow the prisoners to hold their own trial. Hart is recruited to defend his fellow officer, but as he reluctantly investigates, he discovers that not all of his fellow allied soldiers are fighting the same war and that his "client" may well have been framed. In the meantime, it becomes apparent that McNamara is using events to mask his true intent, a mission to destroy a nearby munitions plant that he still intends to carry out despite his incarceration. Hart's War (2002) co-stars Vicellous Shannon, Cole Hauser, Rory Cochrane, and Jonathan Brandis(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">28 Days</title>
    <desc lang="en">In this romantic comedy, a journalist who's become too much the life of the party finds a new lease on life in a drug and alcohol treatment center. New York newspaper columnist Gwen Cummings (Sandra Bullock) has a fondness for liquor, a boyfriend (Dominic West) with a similar taste for the bottle, and a party girl image that camouflages plenty of emotional baggage. At the wedding of her sister (Elizabeth Perkins), Gwen's pursuit of a good time goes a bit too far when she topples the wedding cake and steals the bridal party's limousine. The result is a court-ordered, 28-day stay in a rehabilitation facility for drug and alcohol abusers. Gwen's failure to get with the program causes her to butt heads with the clinic's director (Steve Buscemi), but her attitude begins to change when she meets Eddie Boone (Viggo Mortensen), a baseball player trying to deal with his substance abuse problems. Diane Ladd, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, and Azura Skye play Gwen's fellow rehab inmates, and legendary roots rock band NRBQ performs at the wedding reception(n)</desc>

Invited to the party are a host of friends from their demi-monde, including Kevin Kline as Cal Gold, no longer first call when a rom-com leading man is needed; and Gwyneth Paltrow as Skye Davidson, a rising young star. Also invited are the Therrians' neighbours Ryan and Monica Rose (Denis O'Hare and Mina Badie) who have nothing in common with the gathering of once bright young things.

    <desc lang="en">A handful of college students looking for a good time are thrown into a world of danger in this homage to the slasher film cycle of the 1970s and '80s. Ben (Joel David Moore) has just been given his walking papers by his girlfriend and is deeply depressed. Needing a pick-me-up, Ben and his friend Marcus (Deon Richmond) head to New Orleans for Mardi Gras, and take in a "Haunted Swamp Tour," with master of ceremonies Shawn (Parry Shen) guiding guests through a spooky patch of bayou country. Along the way, Ben and Marcus meet a pair of half-bright exotic dancers, Misty (Mercedes McNab) and Jenna (Joleigh Fioreavanti), as well as Marybeth (Tamara Feldman), a pretty girl who is secretive about her past. As they tour the swamp, Shawn tells his customers about the local legend of Victor Crowley, a deformed man who was taunted by the other children living near the swamp until he was nearly bludgeoned with an axe by his father while trying to open the door of their burning shack. While Ben and Marcus don't think much of the story at first, it doesn't take long before they have serious reason to believe Victor Crowley is still at large -- and is looking to settle some old scores. Hatchet received its world premiere at the 2006 Tribeca Film Festival(n)</desc>

Captain Marley (Robert Forster), pilot Vanzant (James Spader), medical officer Evers (Angela Bassett), medical technician Penalosa (Lou Diamond Phillips), paramedic Lund (Robin Tunney), and computer technician Sotomejor (Wilson Cruz) pick up a distress signal from a group of workers involved in a mining operation on a comet. But as they move in for a rescue, they discover that this isn't the mission of mercy they were expecting. They pick up Larson (Peter Facinelli), a mysterious and menacing man with a strange alien artifact, who draws the ship into the orbit of a huge star that is due to explode into a supernova at any time. Supernova had a production history that can be charitably described as "troubled." Australian filmmaker Geoffrey Wright was replaced by Walter Hill shortly before filming began. Actor Vincent D'Onofrio left the project shortly after Wright, replaced by Cruz. Hill then left the project in post-production and requested that his name be removed from the film. Francis Ford Coppola was hired to supervise a final re-cut, nearly a year after the completion of photography(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Machine Gun Preacher</title>
    <desc lang="en">Gerard Butler stars in Marc Forster's violent, fact-based drama about a substance-addicted criminal who finds God and relocates to Sudan to offer his own idiosyncratic brand of Christian charity. The film initially portrays Sam Childers as being a far from nice man: a misogynistic biker whose life is steeped in crime, narcotics and violence, and who quickly returns to armed robbery almost as soon as he's released from jail. But while he was inside, his wife Lynn found Jesus, and, after Sam gets stabbed, she urges him to join her at church. Sam subsequently has his own Damascene moment and starts life afresh, founding his own (legitimate) construction company. Before long he has also built his own church. But it's only after a trip to Sudan, where he witnesses the devastation wrought by the marauding Lord's Resistance Army, that he truly becomes driven. Relocating to the African country, he sets up a faith-based centre to care for victims of the LRA's violence and rape. And also takes up arms to literally fight the good fight... Also starring Michael Shannon(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Deliver Us From Eva</title>
    <desc lang="en">Three men discover that meddling in their sister-in-law's love life only makes their own lives more complicated in this romantic comedy. Eva Dandridge (Gabrielle Union) developed a sense of responsibility early on in life, when after the death of her parents she was left to care for her three younger sisters, Kareenah (Essence Atkins), Bethany (Robinne Lee), and Jacqui (Meagan Good). All four of the Dandridge sisters have grown up to be attractive, intelligent, and successful; Kareenah is happily married to Tim (Mel Jackson), while Bethany is engaged to Michael (Duane Martin), and Jacqui is going steady with Darrell (Dartanyan Edmonds). However, Eva still watches over her siblings like a hawk, and while her sisters love Eva dearly, Tim, Michael, and Darrell wish their sister-in-law would stay out of their business. The guys decide that if Eva had a boyfriend, she might be less interested in running other people's lives, and they turn to Ray (LL Cool J), a notorious ladies' man, for help. Ray is short on cash, so the guys make him a deal -- they'll give him 5,000 dollars to romance Eva, sweep her off her feet, and then dump her a few weeks later. Ray agrees, and while getting past her no-nonsense demeanor takes some doing, before long she's head over heels for him. However, Ray unexpectedly finds himself falling in love with Eva, and Eva, when offered a job in another town, decides to stay on to be with Ray. Even worse, the other Dandridge sisters are so impressed with the romantic Ray that they start demanding a bit more TLC from their own men(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Gospel-minded playwright David E. Talbert produces, writes, and directs this urban crime comedy concerning a pair of criminals who take a group of church parishioners hostage while attempting to rob the holy house, only to find their captives slowly convincing them to repent and give up their lawless lifestyles. Durell (Ice Cube) and LeeJohn (Tracy Morgan) are two best friends with a special knack for petty crime. Upset at discovering that his ex-girlfriend is planning to move out of state with the couple's young son, Durell knows that the only way to keep his fractured family in close proximity to one another is to raise the 17,000 dollars needed to pay off her growing debt. In order to get the money before his ex decides to make the big move, the desperate Durell enlists the aid of his scheming best buddy to rob their neighborhood church. But someone has beaten Durell and LeeJohn to the punch, and if they ever hope to get their hands on that quick cash, this bumbling pair will first have to spend an entire night in the presence of not just the almighty lord, but some of his most fervent followers as well.

Ben (Jimmy Fallon) is a high-school teacher who meets Lindsay (Drew Barrymore), who has a successful career in business. Ben and Lindsay don't appear to have much in common on the surface, but they hit it off and are soon involved in a serious romance. But when spring rolls around, Lindsay becomes aware of the true love of Ben's life -- the Boston Red Sox. Despite the team's lamentable record, Ben has been a fiercely loyal Red Sox fan since childhood, and Lindsay finds it hard to compete with his passion for baseball, while Ben is forced to choose between the obsessions of his youth and the enthusiasms of a responsible adult. Fever Pitch was shot in part in Boston during the 2004 baseball season, which to the surprise of the filmmakers saw the Red Sox winning baseball's world series for the first time since 1918(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Russell Crowe, Cate Blanchett and Mark Strong star in director Ridley Scott's retelling of one of Britain's most enduring myths. Things go badly wrong for Richard the Lionheart and his men during their return from crusade in the Holy Land. One of the King's soldiers who escapes with his life is archer Robin Longstride, who adopts the persona of the recently slain Robin of Loxley in order to get back to the safety of England. Back on home soil, Robin makes his way to the Loxley estate in order to hand back the dead man's sword. But he's not only greeted with gratitude, he's also unexpectedly invited to continue living his double life, including cohabiting with Loxley's widow, the strong, independent Marion. It may look as though he's landed on his feet, but there's a dark cloud on the horizon in the form of the slippery, villainous Sir Godfrey - who is simultaneously out to squeeze more taxes from the population to fund the playboy lifestyle of Prince John, while also treacherously laying the ground for a second French invasion of Britain(n)</desc>

Back in 1959, a Boston school buried a time capsule containing the pupils' imaginings of what life would be like in the future; most contributions were in the form of pictures, but one was very different. Now, 50 years later, the experiment has been dug up, and the predictions distributed among the school's current students; the oddity - a long list of numbers that baffles everyone - is given to Caleb Koestler, who takes it home. When Chandler's scientist dad, John, takes a look at it he realises that the list details a series of lethal events, all but three of which have already happened. Convinced he's right, John sets out to both prove his theory and stop the impending disasters. But little does he know the danger he, his family and everyone around him are in..(n)</desc>

After 57 years in deep sleep Ripley is rescued from the escape capsule of the starship Nostromo, the sole survivor of the alien attack. Back on Earth, she finds that the planet where she and her late crewmates first made contact has since been colonised, but all communication has been lost. Persuaded that the mission is to destroy the aliens, Ripley joins a group of marines sent to investigate. Inside the colonists' complex, they discover a terrified girl, Newt who reveals the truth; a group of aliens are using the human hosts to incubate. With most of the marines killed, Corporal Hicks takes charge and decides to nuke the planet. But when their shuttlecraft crashes, the survivors find shelter and and must hope their mother ship will pick them up before the raging fires consume the planet and cause a nuclear explosion..(n)</desc>
