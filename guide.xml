    <title lang="en">Tarzan</title>
    <desc lang="en">A teenage boy raised by gorillas in Africa falls for a pretty conservationist following a chance meeting in the jungle, but finds their romance threatened by a menacing Silverback, and a scheming capitalist in search of a new energy source in this animated adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs' classic tale. John Greystoke, Jr. was just a toddler when he accompanied his adventurous mother and father on a journey into Africa in search of a mineral that could revolutionize the energy industry. That trip turns tragic, however, when their helicopter crashes in a race to escape a massive storm, leaving young John the sole survivor. Raised from that day forward by a motherly gorilla named Kala, the boy, now named Tarzan, quickly integrates into the family of primates. But alpha male Silverback Tablat refuses to accept Tarzan's presence, viewing him as a direct threat to the clan. Nearly a decade later, Tarzan encounters beautiful Jane Porter, and begins to long for human contact. When Jane returns to the jungle accompanied by smooth-talking entrepreneur William Clayton a few years later, her relationship with Tarzan is rekindled. But while Clayton has ostensibly come to the jungle to support Jane's conservationist endeavors, he's actually searching for the very same energy source once sought by Tarzan's father, and hopes to turn a tidy profit by exploiting the precious resource. The situation turns critical when Jane recognizes Clayton's true intentions, and the only one who can save her from both the villainous industrialist and the menacing Tablat is the noble Tarzan of the apes(n)</desc>

Hosted by Christine Long, the series used actual footage and re-enactments to show its target audience (kids aged 13 to 16) how to confront and cope with extraordinary situations, many of them dangerous in nature. Typical episodes demonstrated CPR techniques, the extinguishing of household fires, and the handling of moral dilemmas. Also offered were tips on building, cooking and general housekeeping, with added input from experts in these fields. Offering three to four "features" per half hour episode, WHADDAYDO? was first distributed by TVI Media beginning the week of September 12, 2005(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">I Am Legend</title>
    <desc lang="en">Adapted from acclaimed author Richard Matheson's influential novelette of the same name, Constantine director Francis Lawrence's I Am Legend follows the last man on Earth as he struggles to survive while fending off the infected survivors of a devastating vampiric plague. A brilliant scientist who raced to discover a cure for the man-made virus as humanity came crumbling down all around him, Robert Neville (Will Smith) was inexplicably immune to the highly contagious superbug. Now the entire population of New York City -- and perhaps the world -- has been transformed into carnivorous bloodsuckers that fear the light and live solely to spread their contagion to any remaining living creature that crosses their path. It's been three years since civilization came to an end, and the loneliness has taken a devastating toll on Neville. By day he scours the city for food and supplies while sending out desperate radio messages in hopes that someone might respond, and by night he attempts to find a way to reverse the effects of the virus by experimenting with his own blood. But time is running out for Neville as the legions of infected watch his every move from the safety of the shadows, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. They, too, long to learn the secret that lurks in Neville's blood, though they will have to take caution while attempting to procure it because Neville will sooner die attempting to slay every last one of them than willingly giving up a single drop. Previously adapted for the screen in the 1964 Vincent Price frightener The Last Man on Earth and the 1971 Charlton Heston action film The Omega Man, Matheson's novelette also served as the inspiration for George A. Romero's groundbreaking zombie classic Night of the Living Dead(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Adapted from acclaimed author Richard Matheson's influential novelette of the same name, Constantine director Francis Lawrence's I Am Legend follows the last man on Earth as he struggles to survive while fending off the infected survivors of a devastating vampiric plague. A brilliant scientist who raced to discover a cure for the man-made virus as humanity came crumbling down all around him, Robert Neville (Will Smith) was inexplicably immune to the highly contagious superbug. Now the entire population of New York City -- and perhaps the world -- has been transformed into carnivorous bloodsuckers that fear the light and live solely to spread their contagion to any remaining living creature that crosses their path. It's been three years since civilization came to an end, and the loneliness has taken a devastating toll on Neville. By day he scours the city for food and supplies while sending out desperate radio messages in hopes that someone might respond, and by night he attempts to find a way to reverse the effects of the virus by experimenting with his own blood. But time is running out for Neville as the legions of infected watch his every move from the safety of the shadows, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. They, too, long to learn the secret that lurks in Neville's blood, though they will have to take caution while attempting to procure it because Neville will sooner die attempting to slay every last one of them than willingly giving up a single drop. Previously adapted for the screen in the 1964 Vincent Price frightener The Last Man on Earth and the 1971 Charlton Heston action film The Omega Man, Matheson's novelette also served as the inspiration for George A. Romero's groundbreaking zombie classic Night of the Living Dead(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">John Ford Goes to War</title>
    <desc lang="en">In this documentary centered on legendary filmmaker John Ford's cinematic contributions to Allied morale during World War II, actor/musician Kris Kristofferson narrates as the How Green Was My Valley director turns his back on Tinseltown in order to fulfill his patriotic duty. By the time the United States became involved in World War II, John Ford was already a film legend, but when Uncle Sam came calling the veteran filmmaker eagerly packed his bags and set his sites on the frontlines. Though Ford did sustain battlefield injuries during the production of the Oscar-winning documentary The Battle of Midway, the remarkable film endeared him to patriotic American audiences across the country and his next wartime effort, 1943's December 7th, proceeded to earn the filmmaker yet another Oscar. In addition to featuring footage from these and other, lesser-known wartime films from Ford, this documentary also offers an intimate look at the complex filmmaker and explores his remarkable legacy through both archive footage and interviews with such notable directors as Oliver Stone and Peter Bogdanovich(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">After four weeks of heats, 40 hopefuls have been whittled down to the most promising 12 - and now they face the knockout stage, beginning with either a main or a pudding based on briefs by judges John Torode and Gregg Wallace. The top nine then go straight to the next stage, while the bottom three face a cook-off in which they have to come up with their showstopper dish - and with only two more places available, only the best will do.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">MasterChef</title>
    <desc lang="en">The knockout stage continues, and if the amateurs thought it was tough getting this far, the upcoming round will really sort the dishwashers from the chefs. Over the next two nights the remaining contestants are split into two groups and get their first taste of professional cooking. Tonight's hopefuls head to London restaurant Typing Room, overseen by Lee Westcott, where they serve up every dish during a busy lunchtime service. Then it's back to the studio for an Invention Test - but adding to the pressure, they'll be presenting their food to MasterChef: The Professionals judge and formidable perfectionist Monica Galetti. After this, one of them will be hanging up their apron and going home.(n)</desc>

When the Infinity Space Probe goes missing, Ham joins a mission to find it. He's been recruited as a PR stunt, but his fellow Space Chimps, Luna and Titan, are highly trained experts. When they crash-land on the planet Malgor, they find a race of aliens who are being oppressed by the tyrannical Zartog, who is using the probe for his own nefarious ends. Can the feckless Ham use his circus skills to save the day, help liberate the aliens, recover the probe, get the girl, and find a way to get back home? This is great fare for all the family, with plenty of deadpan asides to keep grown-ups entertained(n)</desc>

When the Infinity Space Probe goes missing, Ham joins a mission to find it. He's been recruited as a PR stunt, but his fellow Space Chimps, Luna and Titan, are highly trained experts.

Can the feckless Ham use his circus skills to save the day, help liberate the aliens, recover the probe, get the girl, and find a way to get back home?

The directors explain how Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin, and Jessie Misskelley Jr. were arrested for the crime, and then details how evidence has mounted in the nearly 20 years since then indicating that none of them had anything to do with the crime. The filmmakers centerpiece is an attempt by the threesome's legal team to earn them a new hearing by getting the Arkansas State supreme court to define what kind of new evidence can be admitted into evidence when an old murder case is reopened because of new DNA testing.

The directors explain how Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin, and Jessie Misskelley Jr. were arrested for the crime, and then details how evidence has mounted in the nearly 20 years since then indicating that none of them had anything to do with the crime. The filmmakers centerpiece is an attempt by the threesome's legal team to earn them a new hearing by getting the Arkansas State supreme court to define what kind of new evidence can be admitted into evidence when an old murder case is reopened because of new DNA testing. Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory played at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival(n)</desc>

Kate Holbrook (Fey) is a 37-year-old business executive who has always put her professional life before her personal life, but these days her biological clock is ticking louder than ever before. As with everything else she has accomplished in life, Kate is determined to have a child on her own terms. Unfortunately for Kate, the chance of her ever becoming pregnant is slim to none. Undaunted, a willful Kate drafts South Philly working-class girl Angie Ostrowiski (Poehler) -- a woman who may just be her polar opposite -- to be a surrogate mother. Subsequently informed by the head of the surrogacy center (Sigourney Weaver) that her surrogate is indeed pregnant, the excited mother-to-be soon purchases every child-rearing book she can find and excitedly begins the nesting process. But life hasn't quit throwing Kate curveballs just yet, because when a pregnant Angie shows up on her doorstep with no place to live, the woman who once thrived on order finds her life descending into chaos. Now, as Kate attempts to transform Angie into the ideal expectant mother, this odd couple will discover that families aren't always biological, but occasionally formed through friendship as well. Writer Michael McCullers, who authored the screenplays for Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and Undercover Brother in addition to working on Saturday Night Live, makes his feature directorial debut with a self-penned screenplay(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Snow Angels</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director/screenwriter David Gordon Green adapts Stewart O'Nan's popular novel to the screen in this feature, which tells the parallel tales of a teenager named Arthur (Michael Angarano) and his onetime babysitter Annie (Kate Beckinsale) -- whose turbulent relationship with her estranged husband, Glenn (Sam Rockwell), leads the small-town waitress down a troubled path. Arthur is a high-school student from a dysfunctional family, and does everything in his power to avoid hanging around the house while mom and dad quarrel. When he's not practicing his trombone and performing with the high-school marching band, Arthur can usually be found bussing tables at the local Chinese restaurant and flirting with older waitress Annie. Annie used to be Arthur's babysitter, and is currently struggling to separate from her former high-school sweetheart, Glenn. But being a single mother isn't easy, especially since the troubled Glenn wants nothing more than to clean up his act and reunite his family. Back at school, Arthur and pretty classmate Lila (Olivia Thirlby) have been bonding over their mutual love for all things geeky. Though the casual friendship shows promise of evolving into something more when Lila expresses her true feelings for Arthur, he can't help but becoming distracted by his chaotic family life: his father is moving out of the family home, and his mother is doing everything in her power to maintain some semblance of normalcy. Realizing that happiness is fleeting as his family becomes shattered and Annie experiences a series of distressing encounters with Glenn, Arthur gradually begins to fall for Lisa despite his growing cynicism concerning long-term relationships. Later, on a cold winter morning, Glenn and Annie's past catches up with them in a blinding flash, and the lives of everyone they know are suddenly and irrevocably changed(n)</desc>

The Golden Buzzer went unpressed on Saturday 6th May, which means David Walliams and Ant and Dec may still have the right to send an act straight through to the semi-final, but will any of this evening's performers catch their eye?.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The audition stage of the nationwide talent contest reaches its penultimate round, as Ant and Dec invite another batch of auditionees to show off their unique abilities to judges Simon Cowell, David Walliams, Amanda Holden and Alesha Dixon. Next Monday will see the beginning of the live shows, in which the panel begins the process of whittling down the number of would-be stars they have previously thrown their weight behind throughout the audition process. The Golden Buzzer went unpressed on Saturday 6th May, which means David Walliams and Ant and Dec may still have the right to send an act straight through to the semi-final, but will any of this evening's performers catch their eye?.(n)</desc>

Taped on the network's Saturday Night Live set in New York, the series did its best to eschew the usual couch-and-desk talk show format; with no monologue and no sketches, Daly simply sat down and talked to his guests, who returned the compliment by avoiding the standard relentless plugging of their latest movie, CD, or TV special. Last Call With Carson Daly was supposed to premiere on Monday, January 7, 2002, but a last-minute contract dispute between MTV and NBC forced the latter network to sheepishly issue an apology and move the debut episode to Tuesday, January 8(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Myra Hindley: The Untold Story</title>
    <sub-title lang="en">Partners in Crime: The Lost Body.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The dramatised documentary examines how Ian Brady told the police he and Hindley had killed two more children when he discovered she had fallen in love with a female prison officer. He hoped his belated confession would scupper any chances his former girlfriend had of an early release. A re-launched investigation in 1987 saw the recovery of the body of 16-year-old Pauline Reade, but the remains of 12-year-old Keith Bennett have never been found. The film also charts the state of Brady's mental health, including his decade-long hunger strike and his recent attempt to be transferred to an ordinary prison.(n)</desc>

Alex suggests he strip down his menu and redecorate the dining area, but with the relaunch looming, difficulties arise in the kitchen.(n)</desc>

The emergency services are called out to a flooded bakery HQ, where a constant stream of sausage rolls keeps spirits high, a homesick Geordie hits upon the idea of introducing Newcastle stottie bread to southerners, and the Greggs chefs tackle the seemingly impossible task of concocting low-fat pastries. Can they crack the recipe?.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In the aftermath of a job gone awry, an American hitman retreats to the Italian countryside, where he befriends a local priest and strikes up an unexpected romance while awaiting the details of his next assignment. Jack (George Clooney) is lucky to be alive after his Swedish assignment went sour, and he knows that it's only a matter of time before his luck runs out. Not eager to tempt fate again, Jack arrives in a small Italian town and takes a job assembling a weapon for the mysterious Mathilde (Thekla Reuten). During this uncharacteristically peaceful interlude, Jack befriends kindly clergyman Father Benedetto (Paolo Bonacelli), and connects with pretty local Clara (Violante Placido). But in the process of reaching out for a little human contact, Jack is making himself more vulnerable than ever. The American was adapted for the screen from the novel A Very Private Gentleman by author Martin Booth(n)</desc>

France's come-from-behind victory in the World Cup soccer championships turns tragic when the team's coach, Yves Gulant (Jason Statham), is murdered during a post-game celebration. Gulant's girlfriend, pop star Xania (Beyoncé Knowles), was standing by his side as he was felled by a poisoned dart, and in the chaos that followed a diamond ring he gave her was stolen, which held one of the world's largest and most valuable jewels, known as "the Pink Panther." The media and the public demand that the killer be found out and brought to justice, and Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Kevin Kline) of the Paris Police pledges to put his best man on the case. However, somehow the astoundingly clumsy but consistently lucky Inspector Jacques Clouseau (Steve Martin) gets the assignment instead, and with his assistant, Gendarme Gilbert Ponton (Jean Reno), in tow, Clouseau follows a dizzying trail of clues from Paris to New York City as he attempts to recover the rare diamond and find the villains who killed Gulant. An updated variant on the Inspector Clouseau comedies that helped make Peter Sellers a major star in the United States, The Pink Panther also stars Emily Mortimer, Kristin Chenoweth, Roger Rees, and William Abadie; leading man Steve Martin also wrote the film's screenplay(n)</desc>

Gulant's girlfriend, pop star Xania (Beyoncé Knowles), was standing by his side as he was felled by a poisoned dart, and in the chaos that followed a diamond ring he gave her was stolen, which held one of the world's largest and most valuable jewels, known as "the Pink Panther."

Lonely and destitute, Ali (Matthias Schoenaerts) leaves the north of France for his sister's house in Antibes after becoming the sole guardian of his estranged five-year-old son Sam. When Ali lands a job as a bouncer in a nearby nightclub, things quickly start to look up for the itinerant father and son. Then one night, after breaking up a fight in the club, Ali meets the radiant Stephanie (Marion Cotillard), and slips her his number after dropping her off safely at home. Though Stephanie's position on the high end of the social spectrum makes romance an unlikely prospect for the pair, a tragic accident at Marineland robs her of her legs, and finds her reaching out in desperation to Ali. Her spirit broken by the same tragedy that took her legs, Stephanie gradually finds the courage to go on living trough transcendent moments spent with Ali -- a man with precious little pity, but an enormous love of life(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Daniel Radcliffe stars as Beat Generation icon Allen Ginsberg in this biopic set during the famed poet's early years at Columbia University, and centering on a murder investigation involving Ginsberg, his handsome classmate Lucien Carr, and fellow Beat author William S. Burroughs. The year is 1944. Ginsberg (Radcliffe) is a young student at Columbia University when he falls hopelessly under the spell of charismatic classmate Carr (Dane DeHaan). Alongside Carr, Ginsberg manages to strike up friendships with aspiring writers William S. Burroughs (Ben Foster) and Jack Kerouac (Jack Huston) that would cast conformity to the wind, and serve as the foundation of the Beat movement. Meanwhile, an older outsider named David Kammerer falls deeply and madly in love with the impossibly cool Carr. Later, when Kammerer dies under mysterious circumstances, police arrest Kerouac, Burroughs, and Carr as potential suspects, paving the way for an investigation that would have a major impact on the lives of the three emerging artists.

    <title lang="en">The Perfect Man</title>
    <desc lang="en">A girl plays Cupid for her mom, but has to invent the right man to woo her in this romantic comedy. Jean Hamilton (Heather Locklear) is a single mother with two daughters, teenaged Holly (Hilary Duff) and grade-school-aged Zoe (Aria Wallace). Fortysomething Jean has stumbled in and out of a number of bad relationships in her lifetime, and is desperate to find a good man; however, Holly has grown a bit tired of Jean's favored means of therapy after a bad breakup -- packing up the family and moving to a new city. Once Jean and her girls settle in Brooklyn, Holly thinks they should stay for a while, and when Jean's romantic prospects begin to look less than rosy, Holly and her new friend Amy (Vanessa Lengies) decide to invent a secret admirer for her. Needing advice on what the "perfect man" would say and do, Holly and Amy turn to Ben (Chris Noth), Amy's uncle, who talks a very good game when it comes to romance. But convincing Jean that there's a real man behind the steady stream of letters and e-mails from her new admirer isn't as easy as Holly imagines, and it looks as if her imaginary suitor might get in the way of a flesh-and-blood Mr. Right(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">The Four of Us Are Dying</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The Four of Us Are Dying. Once seen in childhood, the January 1, 1960 Twilight Zone episode "The Four of Us Are Dying" can never be forgotten. Set in a surrealistic New York City (replete with flashing neon signs and forced-perspective streets), the story concerns one Arch Hammer (Harry Townes), a two-bit hood gifted with the ability to change his facial features. In rapid succession, he assumes the personalities of two recently deceased individuals -- jazz musician Johnny Foster (Ross Martin) and murdered gangster Virgil Sterig (Phillip Pine) -- for his own financial and sexual gain. But Arch comes to grief when, pursued by Sterig's killers, he transforms his face into that of punkish prizefighter Andy Marshak (Don Gordon). Enchancing the episode's dramatic clout is a brilliant performance by Beverly Garland as a nightclub singer and a driving musical score by Jerry Goldsmith. "The Four of Us Are Dying" was written by Rod Serling from a story by George Clayton Johnson(n)</desc>
