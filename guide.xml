Schwarzenegger stars as John Kimble, an L.A. cop who learns that the ex-wife and son of his drug-dealer quarry Crisp (Richard Tyson) are living in secrecy in small-town Oregon. Kimble is partnered with Phoebe (Pamela Reed), a former teacher, who is slated to begin undercover work at the school where Crisp's ex is suspected of working under an assumed identity. However, Phoebe becomes ill, forcing rough, gruff Kimble to take over the kindergarten class instead(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Sunshine State</title>
    <desc lang="en">Like Lone Star, Sunshine State is a John Sayles film in which a multitude of characters struggle with the past, both recent and ancient -- both family history and the traumatic past of the land itself. It's set on the fictional Plantation Island in Florida, the history of which is based upon Amelia Island, where the film was actually shot. Lincoln Beach, the once thriving black community on the island, is based on the region's American Beach. Sunshine State portrays a relentless onslaught of real estate developers in the area. Desiree Perry (Angela Bassett, who was also in Sayles' Passion Fish and City of Hope) has returned to Florida for the first time since being sent away as a pregnant teen. She nervously brings her husband, Reggie (James McDaniel of NYPD Blue), an anesthesiologist, to meet her estranged mother, Eunice (Mary Alice). Eunice has recently taken in a troubled teenaged relative, Terrell (newcomer Alexander Lewis). Eunice's friend, Dr. Lloyd (Bill Cobbs), is trying to rally the Lincoln Beach community to slow development. Marly Temple (Edie Falco of The Sopranos, here playing a Southerner) runs the motel owned by her ailing father (Ralph Waite of Waltons fame), but has little interest in the business, and the developers are pressuring her to get her father to sell. She's in the process of ending a relationship with the local golf pro (Marc Blucas from TV's Buffy the Vampire Slayer), when a rather mercenary landscape architect, Jack Meadows (Timothy Hutton), catches her eye. Meanwhile, Francine Pickney (Mary Steenburgen) is so busy organizing the town's cheesy Buccaneer Days festival that she doesn't realize that her husband, Earl (Gordan Clapp, also of NYPD Blue and a Sayles regular) is suicidal. As usual, Sayles wrote, directed, and edited the film, with Maggie Renzi producing(n)</desc>

Nearly 20 years after refusing to inform on his partner-in-crime, Val (Al Pacino) emerges from prison a free man.

Meanwhile, one of the three is harboring a secret that will test their longtime friendship unless they can finally come to terms with their troublesome past. Julianna Margulies co-stars(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Perkins' 14</title>
    <desc lang="en">Dark Ride director Craig Singer returns to the helm with this shocking horror film about a delusional psychopath who creates a unified team of 14 maniacal killers. Produced entirely over the Internet, where writers uploaded story details and actors submitted audition tapes, Perkins' 14 was released into theaters as part of the third After Dark Horror Fest. Ronald Perkins was just six years old when his parents were brutally slaughtered right before his eyes. Unable to overcome the incredible trauma of witnessing such a diabolical event, Perkins becomes convinced that the killers who murdered his parents will eventually return to finish the job they started years ago -- and he plans to be fully prepared to fight back when they do. Years later, when Perkins turns 34, he kidnaps 14 people from his hometown of Stone Cove and sets about reprogramming them to become relentless killing machines. Now, if the killers ever do return, they'll have to get through Perkins' 14 in order to reach their intended target. Trouble is, now that Perkins' 14 are ready for battle, they've become increasingly difficult to contain(n)</desc>

Kenji's trail leads the mismatched cops to Paris, where car chases and a sequence among the under-dressed dancers of the Folies Bergère await them, plus rather a lot of dodgy French stereotypes and a finale atop the Eiffel Tower.

    <desc lang="en">Katie Derham makes use of archive footage and family records to tell the story of how Vera Lynn came to become one of the UK's most well-known musical stars. Vera celebrates her 100th birthday on March 20th, and marks the occasion by reminiscing about her early days in showbusiness, with help from her daughter Virginia. She recalls starting out as Vera Welch in the 1920s, first appearing on stage at the tender age of seven, before charming the nation's servicemen and becoming the `forces sweetheart' during the Second World War. She also remembers becoming the first British artist to achieve a number one in America in the 1950s, and a similar feat in 2009, when she became the oldest living singer to reach the same position in the UK charts. Along the way, Second World War veterans and entertainment industry figures - including Paul McCartney, Barry Humphries and Miriam Margolyes - pay tribute to the power of her voice.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Rich House, Poor House</title>
    <desc lang="en">Families from opposite ends of the wealth and class divide swap homes, budgets and social status for seven days to discover how the other half lives. The Bentleys from Lincolnshire trade places with the Carter-Begbie family from Stamford. The Bentleys rank in the top 10 per cent of Britain's wealthy, and live in a large four-bedroom house with three bathrooms, two reception rooms, a top-of-the-range kitchen, conservatory and games room. The Carter-Begbies live in a rented three-bedroom house and have a weekly budget of £140. This week, however, that will rise to almost £1,800.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Shannon Matthews: The Mother's Story</title>
    <desc lang="en">The disappearance of nine-year-old Shannon Matthews in 2008 gripped the nation. Her mother Karen claimed that her daughter had gone missing on her way home from school, prompting a nationwide search. But weeks later, it was revealed that Karen had known the truth all along - Shannon was being kept hidden by a man known to her mother, who had plotted to claim the £50,000 reward money for her return. This documentary tries to get at the truth of a woman many have branded as evil, asking what drove her to do it, how she can rebuild her life and whether she is sorry for her actions.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Fired Up!</title>
    <desc lang="en">This peppy and uproarious teen romp is boosted by excellent performances from Nicholas D'Agosto and Eric Christian Olsen as Illinois high-school football stars who bag summer camp in red-hot Texas to try their luck at cheerleading camp instead. With 300 young ladies to hit on, it becomes more of a booty camp than boot camp for the two young lotharios. But before they know it, both get more involved, romantically and athletically, than they expected. Molly Sims. Directed by Will Gluck(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Good Day for a Hanging</title>
    <desc lang="en">When the sheriff of a small western town is murdered, Ben Cutler (Fred MacMurray) puts on a badge and organizes a posse to bring in the killer, a personable young hotshot known as The Kid (Robert Vaughn). Upon bringing The Kid back to town, Ben prepares to oversee his execution, only to discover that the townsfolk are in sympathy with the murderer and don't much care if he is punished. The longer The Kid remains in jail, the locals grow more and more fond of the prisoner, and begin working up strategies to prevent his date with the gallows. Much to his surprise, Ben is accused of being a cruel and sadistic man, and the evidence he has against the Kid is ignored and discredited--even by Ben's own daughter Laurie (Joan Blackman). It will take something more than Ben's word to convince his neighbors that they're wrong and he's right, and that "something more" isn't long in coming(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">How Stella Got Her Groove Back</title>
    <desc lang="en">Terry McMillan and Ron Bass wrote this screenplay based on McMillan's semi-autobiographical best-selling novel (over 2,000,000 copies in print before the release of this film). San Francisco stockbroker Stella (Angela Bassett), a 40-year-old divorcee, has a nice Marin County home and an 11-year-old son, Quincy (Michael J. Pagan). With Quincy off to see his dad, Stella and her best friend Delilah (Whoopi Goldberg) vacation in Jamaica, where she meets sexy, good-looking Winston Shakespeare (Taye Diggs). He's the man of her dreams in every way except one -- he's half her age. Even so, a romance develops. Grammy Award-winning songwriters Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis supervised the film's music and produced the R&amp;B-slanted soundtrack album. Shown at the 1998 Urbanworld Film Festival (NY)(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Gunmen</title>
    <desc lang="en">This film opens with a big fat close-up of a sweaty prisoner with a fly (on a string) crawling on his face. The prisoner quickly pops the fly in his mouth and spits it out. Then he leeringly laughs about it to the prisoner next door. Nope. This is not a bad undiscovered Sergio Leone spaghetti western. Rather it is the opening shot Deran Sarafin's Gunmen -- a brainless action film without an original thought in its head. Christopher Lambert is the fly-eater, a man named Dani Servigo, the brother of a dead smuggler and a prisoner in a South American jail, who holds the secret to the whereabouts of $400,000 in stolen drug money. The walls of the prison explode, and Cole Parker (Mario Van Pebbles) makes his entrance. Cole is a mercenary working with the DEA who is in this South American hellhole to mop up the drug traders and to avenge his father's death at the hands of the drug traders. He wants Dani to lead him to the gold. In this love-hate buddy film, the two thrown-together friends/enemies race through the Amazon jungle with ruthless assassins in pursuit, as they all gravitate towards the secret stash of money(n)</desc>

Lisa Simpson (voice of Yeardley Smith) and her brother Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright) are among the students at Springfield Elementary who take part in the school's Model United Nations program, and along with their classmates they board a bus for a mock UN conference being held in a neighboring town. The rattletrap bus runs off a bridge into the river below, and a freak wave sends the vehicle off to sea. Bus driver Otto (voice of Harry Shearer) is washed away, but the students arrive safely on a deserted island.

Millhouse (voice of Pamela Hayden) is chosen to guard the food, but come morning, the snacks are gone and Millhouse claims a monster stole them. No one is willing to believe Millhouse, and as order breaks down, the kids devolve into a band of feral savages. Meanwhile back at home, Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) decides to start a home business to make some extra money, and launches an internet firm that seems ready to pay off when it attracts the attention of Bill Gates.

    <title lang="en">The Sixth Sense</title>
    <desc lang="en">(1999) M Night Shyamalan's chiller about a boy who has the not-entirely-welcome ability to directly contact the dead. Bruce Willis stars as child psychologist Dr Malcolm Crowe, who is asked to help Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), who claims he can 'see dead people'. Crowe is sceptical at first, but - prompted partly by a past case he felt he badly let down - he's gradually convinced that the boy is telling the truth. Crowe believes that actively engaging with the ghostly presences could help both Sear and the spirits to find peace. Overcoming his terror, the lad finds that communicating with the deceased does, at first, seem to be beneficial. But then matters take on their own momentum, leading to one of the director's trademark plot twists... Also starring Toni Collette. M,W,S,(n)</desc>

Steve Martin costars as Fey's New Age health-food entrepreneur boss, and Sigourney Weaver is hilarious as a smug director of the surrogacy agency.

    <title lang="en">The Sixth Sense</title>
    <desc lang="en">(1999) M Night Shyamalan's chiller about a boy who has the not-entirely-welcome ability to directly contact the dead. Bruce Willis stars as child psychologist Dr Malcolm Crowe, who is asked to help Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), who claims he can 'see dead people'. Crowe is sceptical at first, but - prompted partly by a past case he felt he badly let down - he's gradually convinced that the boy is telling the truth. Crowe believes that actively engaging with the ghostly presences could help both Sear and the spirits to find peace. Overcoming his terror, the lad finds that communicating with the deceased does, at first, seem to be beneficial. But then matters take on their own momentum, leading to one of the director's trademark plot twists... Also starring Toni Collette. M,W,S,(n)</desc>

Carlos and Elena are close friends with Mike White (McCaleb Burnett) and Betty Bristol (Ashley Wolfe), who were born and raised in the States. Like Carlos and Elena, Mike and Betty are planning to marry but haven't done so yet, and when they learn of their friends' dilemma, someone comes up with a solution -- Carlos will marry Betty, Mike will marry Elena, and once their respective green cards come through, both couples will divorce and everyone lives happily ever after. However, the plan doesn't go as smoothly as expected -- suspicious immigration agents are keeping a close watch on Carlos and Elena, so the newlyweds have to live with their respective spouses and act happily married in order to maintain the illusion of matrimony, which leads the four friends into a variety of romantic complications.

    <desc lang="en">Just how low will a guy sink in order to impress the woman of his dreams? How does stealing her dog sound? In Lost and Found, David Spade plays Dylan, who is about to open an new restaurant and has finally found the perfect apartment. The apartment just gets better when he meets his new neighbor, Lila (Sophie Marceau), a very beautiful women who has recently come to the United States from France. However, Lila has just gotten out of a bad relationship with René (Patrick Bruel), who doesn't want to leave her alone, so she has little interest in romance, preferring to devote herself to her cello and her dog Jack. One day, Jack runs away and Dylan finds him; when he returns the pooch to Lila, it's the first time she's been willing to speak in full sentences to him, though not for very long.

Josh (Josh Kornbluth) is an overstuffed aspiring writer who is trying to finish his first novel, but in the meantime he supports himself by working as an office temp. Josh has grown accustomed to the Byzantine world of temporary labor, particularly the bossy secretaries and chilly co-workers, but Josh manages to impress his latest employers enough that they offer to make him a permanent, full-time employee. While a fellow temp who worked for the same company warns Josh that taking the job would be a mistake, Josh takes the plunge anyway, and soon discovers that his fellow employees now embrace him as one of their own. He also discovers that Bob Shelby (Warren Keith), his new boss, is more than a little crazy, and when Bob gives Josh an assignment to mail a series of important letters, John finds that he's suddenly incapable of doing this seemingly simple task. Instead, Josh spends his days working on his book (on company time and on a company computer), with his fellow office drones offering emphatic encouragement. Josh Kornbluth adapted Haiku Tunnel (with the help of John Bellucci and Jacob Kornbluth) from a semi-improvised one-man show Kornbluth created with David Ford; the Kornbluth brothers also directed the film(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Last Mimzy</title>
    <desc lang="en">An intergalactic package discovered on the beach holds a myriad of fantastic discoveries for siblings Noah and Emma Wilder in The Last Mimzy, studio head-turned-director Bob Shaye's wondrous sci-fi fantasy parable. The children stumble onto their discovery amid a trip to the family beach house, and find inside of the crate strange crystals that Emma levitates with her mind, as well as the Mimzy -- a stuffed bunny with a built-in supercomputer that advances its possessor's brain by great leaps and bounds by whispering into the person's ear. Meanwhile, via interaction with the box and its contents, Noah gains the ability to converse with spiders and instructs them to build miniature bridges. He also etches complex Tibetan mandalas, and somehow manages to black out half of Seattle. The children naturally keep these happenings (and the box) from their mom and dad (Joely Richardson and Timothy Hutton), but in time the kids set their sights higher and embark on correcting huge problems that cannot be missed. Rainn Wilson (The Office) co-stars as the children's hippie science teacher; New Age expert Bruce Joel Rubin (Ghost, Jacob's Ladder) and Toby Emmerich co-authored the script, adapting the 1943 short story Mimsy Were the Borogoves, by Lewis Padgett(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">After being discharged from the Army, Brian Flanagan (Tom Cruise) moves back to Queens and takes a job in a bar run by Doug Coughlin (Bryan Brown), who teaches Brian the fine art of bartending. Brian quickly becomes a patron favorite with his flashy drink-mixing style. Brian adopts his mentor's cynical philosophy on life and goes for the money. He leaves his artist girlfriend Jordan Mooney (Elisabeth Shue) for Bonnie (Lisa Banes), a wealthy, high-powered executive. Brian soon must chose between the two, as he evaluates his options. Scriptwriter Heywood Gould displayed his sense of humor when assigning the character name "Mr. Mooney" to Lucille Ball's real-life son-in-law, actor Laurence Luckenbill. Television fans of The Lucy Show will recall Mr. Mooney, played by Gale Gordon, as Lucy's fussy financial boss. The film is more memorable for the 17-song soundtrack and plays like a series of MTV videos. Cocktail was a big draw at the box office in 1988(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Departed</title>
    <desc lang="en">Legendary director Martin Scorsese takes the helm for this tale of questionable loyalties and blurring identities set in the South Boston organized crime scene and inspired by the wildly popular 2002 Hong Kong crime film Infernal Affairs. As the police force attempts to reign in the increasingly powerful Irish mafia, authorities are faced with the prospect of sending in an undercover agent or seeing their already frail grip on the criminal underworld slip even further. Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a young cop looking to make a name for himself in the world of law enforcement. Collin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is a street-smart criminal who has successfully infiltrated the police department with the sole intention of reporting their every move to ruthless syndicate head Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). When Costigan is assigned the task of working his way into Costello's tightly guarded inner circle, Sullivan is faced with the responsibility of rooting out the informer before things get out of hand. With the stakes constantly rising and time quickly running out for the undercover cop and his criminal counterpart, each man must work feverishly to reveal his counterpart before his identity is exposed by the other. Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, and Ray Winstone co-star, and writer William Monahan adapts a screenplay originally penned by Alan Mak and Felix Chong(n)</desc>

After calling a truce with Addison (Kate Walsh), Derek (Patrick Dempsey) shares a few words (and a bath!) with Meredith.

    <title lang="en">Winged Seduction: Birds of Paradise</title>
    <desc lang="en">National Geographic photographer Tim Laman and ornithologist Ed Scholes have spent the better part of a decade sleeping in tents and dangling from the rain forest canopy to document all 39 species of Birds of Paradise. Their mission takes them into the jungles of one of last wild places on earth, New Guinea - where children carry machetes, women carry heavy loads and men carry on tribal warfare. Far-flung islands, impenetrable jungle and extreme elevations all create areas of isolation where ordinary birds have evolved into some of the most beautifully bizarre species on earth. Tim and Ed's first quarry on this expedition is Goldie's Bird of Paradise - a dazzling color-shaker that attracts females with a mating dance done in pairs. Rough seas, a flooded island and inaccurate scouting all stand in their way, but Tim and Ed make natural history filmmaking history by capturing a Goldie display with a remote controlled camouflaged camera. After a wild flight into the Huon Mountains, they search out Wahne's Parotia, a shape-shifter that transforms from bird to a feathered man in a skirt. Tim and Ed are after a scientific first - filming the Parotia from the female's perspective. Feathers that look like a skirt from the side, look like an oval from above, where the female audience members sit - no human has ever filmed it before. Digital explorers on an old-fashioned quest, Tim and Ed have survived everything the jungle has to throw at them to become first in the world to capture all 39 species of Birds of Paradise(n)</desc>

In this one hour programme physicists such as Stephen Hawking and Michio Kaku talk about the possibility of time travel. They both agree that time travel to the future is possible. Traveling close to the speed of light will slow down the rate of time experienced. But other physicists are trying to find ways to travel back in time. To do this they attempt to warp space and time by using gravity. Time travel into the past does however raise some difficult issues. Could the time traveler alter history?(n)</desc>

The wolf hones its hunting skills over about two years of intensive training-and the lessons are hard.

    <title lang="en">Mighty Joe Young</title>
    <desc lang="en">Ron Underwood's remake of the 1949 cult classic stars Charlize Theron as Jill Young, who runs a game reserve in Africa that is home to Mighty Joe Young, a paranormally large gorilla. But both of them are in danger from big game hunter Strasser, who was also responsible for orphaning Jill and Joe. When Gregg O'Hara, a Californian zoologist, offers them both a haven in his reserve in America, Jill accepts but Strasser won't be thwarted and pursues Joe. And when Joe escapes and starts running amok in Hollywood, it seems the hunter's moment may have come... Since the film is produced by Disney, it is heart-warming throughout, but fans of special effects will enjoy the realisation of Joe, the work of expert Rick Baker, who also worked on King Kong (1976) and Gorillas in the Mist(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Crash</title>
    <desc lang="en">(2004) Paul Haggis won two Oscars for his major feature debut as director and co-writer. Set in Los Angeles over two days, it is a picaresque, episodic film with a cast of disparate characters whose lives coincide for one reason or another, from racist cop John Ryan (Matt Dillon) who pulls over black TV director Cameron Thayer (Terrence Howard) and his wife Christine (Thandie Newton), to the simple hassles that Iranian Farad (Shaun Toub) encounters. Haggis shows a city where racism and its manifestations are easily encountered but where those at both the giving and receiving end are not simple ciphers but complex human beings whose intolerance is caused by both personal problems and issues within society at large.

    <desc lang="en">Ron Underwood's remake of the 1949 cult classic stars Charlize Theron as Jill Young, who runs a game reserve in Africa that is home to Mighty Joe Young, a paranormally large gorilla. But both of them are in danger from big game hunter Strasser, who was also responsible for orphaning Jill and Joe. When Gregg O'Hara, a Californian zoologist, offers them both a haven in his reserve in America, Jill accepts but Strasser won't be thwarted and pursues Joe. And when Joe escapes and starts running amok in Hollywood, it seems the hunter's moment may have come... Since the film is produced by Disney, it is heart-warming throughout, but fans of special effects will enjoy the realisation of Joe, the work of expert Rick Baker, who also worked on King Kong (1976) and Gorillas in the Mist(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Crash</title>
    <desc lang="en">(2004) Paul Haggis won two Oscars for his major feature debut as director and co-writer. Set in Los Angeles over two days, it is a picaresque, episodic film with a cast of disparate characters whose lives coincide for one reason or another, from racist cop John Ryan (Matt Dillon) who pulls over black TV director Cameron Thayer (Terrence Howard) and his wife Christine (Thandie Newton), to the simple hassles that Iranian Farad (Shaun Toub) encounters. Haggis shows a city where racism and its manifestations are easily encountered but where those at both the giving and receiving end are not simple ciphers but complex human beings whose intolerance is caused by both personal problems and issues within society at large.

    <title lang="en">Tiny Furniture</title>
    <desc lang="en">A recent college graduate keeps stumbling as she steps out into the real world in this independent comedy drama. Aura (Lena Dunham) has just graduated from a university in the Midwest, receiving a degree in film theory that even she seems to realize is essentially worthless. With no real prospects she returns home to her mother, Siri (Laurie Simmons), a successful photographer living in New York City. Aura's 17-year-old sister, Nadine (Grace Dunham), is about to graduate from high school and is choosing which college to attend in the fall; Aura is ostensibly back home to help Siri and Nadine during a hectic time, but they don't appear to particularly need or want her assistance. Aura befriends Jed (Alex Karpovsky), a minor celebrity thanks to his surreal YouTube videos, who insists he's in New York to take meetings for an upcoming TV project; he soon invites himself into Aura's bedroom as a semi-permanent guest, though he clearly has no interest in any sort of romantic or sexual relationship. With little else to do, Aura takes a job at a nearby restaurant and becomes smitten with Keith (David Call), one of the cooks; while he seems attracted to her, he also has a girlfriend and it isn't until they're both stoned one night that he makes his move in a rather unusual setting. Tiny Furniture was written and directed by Lena Dunham, who also plays Aura; Laurie Simmons and Grace Dunham are her mother and sister in real life as well as in the film, which was mostly shot in Simmons' actual apartment. The film was named Best Narrative Feature at the 2010 South by Southwest Film Festival(n)</desc>

What he has is a tractor-mower that he decides to drive the 300 miles to Wisconsin. The film simply documents his painfully slow progress, the people he meets and the adventures he has but does so with loving care, slowly bringing out Alvin's character but showing along the way how he too brings out the best in those he meets.

    <desc lang="en">Shot in black-and-white and set in small-town California in the late '40s, this latest film from Joel Coen and brother Ethan Coen is a throwback to vintage film noir. Recalling Alfred Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt in its setting of Santa Rosa, CA, the story follows the dutiful, passive barber Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton), who narrates the tale. A soft-spoken fellow, Ed is greeted by Creighton Tolliver (played by Coen regular Jon Polito), a chatterbox customer who tells Ed that dry cleaning is the wave of the future. When Ed discovers his wife Doris (Frances McDormand) has been cheating on him with her department store boss Big Dave (James Gandolfini), Ed suddenly turns bitterly jealous. He hatches a blackmail scheme to extort money from Big Dave to fund a dry cleaning enterprise, which takes a wrong turn when Big Dave ends up dead. Meanwhile, Doris is charged with Dave's murder, having been found doctoring the books at her job, and Ed hires an impeccable new lawyer (Tony Shalhoub), who proves costly in the midst of his already unraveling life. The film also co-stars Michael Badalucco, Katherine Borowitz, and Scarlet Johanssen(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Sound and the Fury</title>
    <desc lang="en">James Franco directs this adaptation of William Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury, the writer's tale of the Compson family, a once wealthy Southern clan devolving into obscurity. Tim Blake Nelson portrays the patriarch, a boozy lawyer who oversees the lives of his children with cynical monologues delivered through an alcoholic haze. Quentin, the oldest child, goes to Harvard, but he's very close with Caddy, the only daughter in the family who has a child out of wedlock. Second son Jason attempts to rule the family with an iron fist, but he's full of resentment towards Caddy's bastard child. All of them attempt to care for the developmentally disabled Benjy (Franco). Franco employs a fractured approach to the narrative in an attempt to capture Faulkner's distinctive prose style. The Sound and the Fury screened at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival(n)</desc>

But La Fleur decides to set up a money-earning dodgeball tournament (a sport that consists of not being hit by balls hurled by the opposing team). And, of course, La Fleur's team of misfits end up in a face-off against Goodman's tough pros in the final.

    <title lang="en">Deliver Us From Eva</title>
    <desc lang="en">Three men discover that meddling in their sister-in-law's love life only makes their own lives more complicated in this romantic comedy. Eva Dandridge (Gabrielle Union) developed a sense of responsibility early on in life, when after the death of her parents she was left to care for her three younger sisters, Kareenah (Essence Atkins), Bethany (Robinne Lee), and Jacqui (Meagan Good). All four of the Dandridge sisters have grown up to be attractive, intelligent, and successful; Kareenah is happily married to Tim (Mel Jackson), while Bethany is engaged to Michael (Duane Martin), and Jacqui is going steady with Darrell (Dartanyan Edmonds). However, Eva still watches over her siblings like a hawk, and while her sisters love Eva dearly, Tim, Michael, and Darrell wish their sister-in-law would stay out of their business. The guys decide that if Eva had a boyfriend, she might be less interested in running other people's lives, and they turn to Ray (LL Cool J), a notorious ladies' man, for help. Ray is short on cash, so the guys make him a deal -- they'll give him 5,000 dollars to romance Eva, sweep her off her feet, and then dump her a few weeks later. Ray agrees, and while getting past her no-nonsense demeanor takes some doing, before long she's head over heels for him. However, Ray unexpectedly finds himself falling in love with Eva, and Eva, when offered a job in another town, decides to stay on to be with Ray. Even worse, the other Dandridge sisters are so impressed with the romantic Ray that they start demanding a bit more TLC from their own men(n)</desc>

Although it was not the last episode shot for the show's fifth season -- that would be "The Hamptons," which aired second to last -- it makes sense that "The Opposite" aired last, as several turns of events set the stage for the sixth season. It all starts with George deciding to do the opposite of everything he would normally do. Once he puts the plan into action, the perennial loser suddenly sees things going well for himself. He gets a girlfriend, a job with the Yankees, and finally moves out of his parents house. Meanwhile, Jerry realizes that his luck is "even Steven," Kramer appears on Live! With Regis and Kathy Lee to promote his coffee-table book about coffee tables, and Elaine suddenly can't win, leading her to believe that she has switched places with George. Originally airing May 19, 1994, the fifth-season closer guest starred 3rd Rock From the Sun's French Stewart and featured the first appearance of the faceless George Steinbrenner, voiced by co-creator Larry David(n)</desc>
