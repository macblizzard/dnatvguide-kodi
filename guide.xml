    <desc lang="en">Will Ferrell, Woody Harrelson and André Benjamin star in Kent Alterman's sports comedy. Jackie Moon is a musician whose sole chart success earns him enough to buy a professional basketball team. It's 1976 and Moon's team, the Tropics, plays in the American Basketball Association, which is about to merge with the National Basketball Association. But only four teams from the ABA will survive the merger, and Moon is determined not to be left owning a defunct team. As well as earning enough points, they also have to attract at least 2000 fans to each home game, so Moon stages a series of desperate publicity stunts, from the astute to the gloriously insane (and, while this is a loose retelling of the ABA/NBA story, some of these stunts actually happened). Can Moon, his back-from-retirement signing Monix and self-centred but promising youngster Clarence ensure the Tropics' survival?(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Casanova</title>
    <desc lang="en">History's most renowned ladies' man finally meets his match in this historical romance laced with comedy and adventure. In Venice in 1753, Giacomo Casanova (Heath Ledger) is a notorious playboy whose way with women goes too far when he's caught leaving the bedroom of a novice nun, and one of the leading prosecutors of the Inquisition, Pucci (Jeremy Irons), puts him on trial. The Doge (Tim McInnerny), Venice's political point man, is a friend of Casanova's and pulls strings to get him off the hook and allow him to stay in the city, but under one condition -- he must take a wife and remain faithful to her. Casanova sets his sights on Victoria (Natalie Dormer), a lovely young maiden who is obviously taken with the handsome ladykiller, but he's not the only one who wants her hand. Giovanni Bruni (Charlie Cox) is a young man who is very much in love with Victoria, and in order to move him out of the picture, Casanova challenges him to a duel. However, when Casanova is bested in swords in the challenge, he discovers he's actually been parrying with Giovanni's sister, Francesca (Sienna Miller). As Casanova gets to know Francesca, he discovers she's a gifted writer and a bright and independent woman as well as a good hand with a sword, and he comes to the realization that she's the woman he wants to take to the altar. However, Francesca has already been promised to the vain and chubby Papprizzio (Oliver Platt), a man she's never met, and she doesn't seem at all interested in the notorious Casanova. Casanova also stars Lena Olin, and Omid Djalili(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A rag-tag group of con artists and ex-cons team up for the heist to end all heists in this high-profile remake of the 1960 Rat Pack favorite. As with its predecessor, Ocean's Eleven opens with its titular hero Danny Ocean (George Clooney stepping into the Frank Sinatra role) eager for a new challenge. The similarities to the original end there, as Ocean conspires with his old pal Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) to rob 150 million dollars from an underground vault that serves three of Las Vegas' biggest casinos. Between the two of them, they recruit nine other men, each with his own criminal specialty, to assist in the mission: moneyman Reuben Tishkoff (Elliot Gould), card dealer Frank (Bernie Mac), pickpocket Linus (Matt Damon), aging con artist Saul (Carl Reiner), British explosives pro Basher (Don Cheadle), techie Dell (Eddie Jemison), rude-boy brothers Virgil (Casey Affleck) and Turk (Scott Caan), and professional acrobat Yen (Shaobo Qin). What Ocean doesn't tell the group is that there's another reason he's coordinating the heist: the three casinos they're robbing are all owned by ruthless gambling mogul Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), who just happens to be married to Ocean's former love Tess (Julia Roberts). Ocean's Eleven was updated by scribe Ted Griffin and marked the third feature shot by director Steven Soderbergh under the alias Peter Andrews(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Day 10.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Sue Barker introduces coverage of day 10 at the All England Club, where the ladies' semi-final singles matches are due to take place. The opening contest at the corresponding stage of last year's tournament featured six-time champion Serena Williams in action against the unseeded Elena Vesnina, who was appearing in her first-ever Grand Slam semi-final. While the American's pedigree at SW19 is unquestionable, Vesnina had failed to progress beyond the second round during this decade, and had crashed out at the first time of asking 12 months previously, so would have to produce an almighty upset if she was to reach the final. As expected, it was the defending champion who emerged victorious, claiming a straightforward 6-2, 6-0 victory, as she continued her efforts to retain the title. Other matches scheduled to take place today include the semi-finals of the men's doubles competition.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">On Monday, March 13, 2006, eight healthy young men took part in a clinical trial of an experimental drug known as TGN1412. The drug was intended to treat leukaemia and had already been successfully tested on monkeys but never on humans. However, it went terribly wrong, leaving six of the volunteers fighting for their lives. This drama-documentary tells the story of one of the most infamous medical emergencies in recent British history.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">An extreme vacation turns terrifying when a group of friends visit the Chernobyl disaster site, and learn that some nightmares never die. Conceived and produced by Paranormal Activity's Oren Peli, Chernobyl Diaries gets underway as six thrill-seeking tourists hire a fearless tour guide, and travel to the abandoned Ukrainian city of Pripyat. Back when the Chernobyl nuclear reactor was up and running, Pripyat was the place the workers called home. But 25 years after one of the worst power-plant accidents in history, the city serves as an eerily silent testament to the dangers of nuclear power. Later, after getting unexpectedly stranded in Pripyat, the tourists and their guide realize they are being hunted. Now the harder they try to flee, the faster their numbers dwindle until only a few are left standing. Only then will the unspeakable terror that stalks these deserted streets finally emerge from the shadows to launch one last relentless, terrifying attack(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Cabin Boy</title>
    <desc lang="en">Chris Elliot lends his flat and charmless presence to Adam Resnick's equally flat and charmless Cabin Boy. Elliot plays Nathaniel Mayweather, a simpering, upper-class snob who has just graduated from the Stephenson Finishing School. At the school he has completed all the course work to become an official "fancy lad." He heads after graduation to set sail and take over the charge of his father's hotel in Hawaii. But instead of getting on the luxury liner Queen Catherine, he boards a stinking fishing scow, "The Filthy Whore." The dirty and surly crew refuses to take Nathaniel to Hawaii, so Nathaniel takes matters into his own hands and tries to change the course of the ship. That he does, but instead of Hawaii, he sends the vessel into a bizarre section of the ocean called "Hell's Bucket" --a Ray Harryhausen nightmare spot with walking icebergs, talking cupcakes, laughing clouds, six-armed-women, and giant hardware-store managers. Through all this, Nathaniel develops a romance with a long-distance swimmer, Trina (Melora Walters), that the fishing tug has snagged. The beatific romance comes to a head one night as Nathaniel and Trina stare into the star-lit sky. Trina bares her soul to Nathaniel, after which, Nathaniel responds, "Sorry. I was just thinking how much fun it is to roast pumpkin seeds."(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">An extreme vacation turns terrifying when a group of friends visit the Chernobyl disaster site, and learn that some nightmares never die. Conceived and produced by Paranormal Activity's Oren Peli, Chernobyl Diaries gets underway as six thrill-seeking tourists hire a fearless tour guide, and travel to the abandoned Ukrainian city of Pripyat. Back when the Chernobyl nuclear reactor was up and running, Pripyat was the place the workers called home. But 25 years after one of the worst power-plant accidents in history, the city serves as an eerily silent testament to the dangers of nuclear power. Later, after getting unexpectedly stranded in Pripyat, the tourists and their guide realize they are being hunted. Now the harder they try to flee, the faster their numbers dwindle until only a few are left standing. Only then will the unspeakable terror that stalks these deserted streets finally emerge from the shadows to launch one last relentless, terrifying attack(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Brooklyn's Finest</title>
    <desc lang="en">In 'Brooklyn's Finest', we're taken on a dark ride through the streets of Brooklyn, following three New York Police officers as they wrestle with temptation while attempting to uphold the law and deal with the pressures of the job. Eddie (Richard Gere) is a bitter and disillusioned veteran cop who's a week away from retirement. Tango (Don Cheadle) is an undercover narcotics cop who tries desperately to leave the streets and earn a promotion to a desk job. Much like Eddie, he's lost sight of his priorities and his loyalties seem to lie more with notorious inner-city drug dealer Caz (Wesley Snipes) than with the boys in blue. At the same time, narcotics detective Sal is a family man in despair and needs to raise money to buy a better house for his family. In seven days, the lives of all three officers will converge at one crime scene(n)</desc>

However, a bogus neighborhood Santa Claus (Rickey Smiley) decides to help Craig and Day-Day share the wealth by robbing their apartment, and when he rips off their stereo, he also makes off with their rent money, which was hidden in the speaker cabinets. Desperate to make rent and have some money for Christmas presents, Craig and Day-Day land jobs at a local strip mall, where their fathers, Mr. Jones (John Witherspoon) and Uncle Elroy (Don "D.C."

    <title lang="en">Speed 2: Cruise Control</title>
    <desc lang="en">After finding herself stuck on an out-of-control bus in the first movie, Sandra Bullock's feisty heroine Annie returns for a new adventure. Annie thinks her new boyfriend, Alex (Jason Patric), is a policeman and she wants him to stop putting his life in danger. What Alex hasn't told her is that he's actually a SWAT team member, which means he's engaged in some of the most dangerous activities imaginable! When Annie finds out the truth, Alex decides to apologise by taking her on a romantic cruise. But fate conspires to ruin their holiday when disgruntled ex-employee Geiger (Willem Dafoe) decides to forego an industrial tribunal in favour of blowing up the boat owned by the company which fired him! As the now out-of-control cruise ship hurtles towards potential destruction and Annie gets herself into a series of risky scrapes, Alex dangles, dives, swings and leaps his way around the ship, rescuing passengers in distress and desperately searching for a way to prevent his romantic cruise from having an explosive ending(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">David Jason stars in this follow-up to Roy Clarke's popular comedy Open All Hours. Once the dogsbody, Granville has inherited the business from his miserly uncle Albert Arkwright, but he is not alone in running the shop - he now has his own assistant in the shape of his son Leroy, who proves more popular with the ladies than his dad ever did. It's a typical day at the grocer's as Granville tries to get a date with old flame Mavis without her terrifying sister Madge finding out, while Leroy shuns the old delivery bike in favour of an altogether more attractive way to take out the orders. James Baxter and Lynda Baron co-star, with appearances by Johnny Vegas, Mark Williams, Brigit Forsyth, Nina Wadia and Sally Lindsay.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">After five weeks of heats, 60 hopefuls have been whittled down to the most promising 10. But if they thought it was tough getting this far, the knockout stage will really sort the dishwashers from the chefs, as over the next two nights the remaining contestants are split into two groups of five and get their first taste of professional cooking. Tonight's group heads to London's Caxton Grill, where 2013 MasterChef: The Professionals finalist Adam Handling is head chef for a busy lunchtime service.

    <desc lang="en">Judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood assess the remaining contestants' dessert-making skills. The hopefuls start by creating tortes before tackling this week's technical test - the delicate French dish of creme caramel. Though these two rounds provide a stern examination of the amateurs' creative flair and technical ability, they then face possibly the toughest task of the series so far - a six-hour challenge to create a show-stopping layered meringue. Once the sugar has set, who will be this week's Star Baker, and who will be going home? Presented by Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins. From 2012.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The remaining contestants' pie-making skills are put to the test in a trio of demanding tasks. First, the hopefuls try to impress judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry by making beef Wellington, before creating hand-raised pies during this round's technical challenge - but several of the cooks run into difficulties as they try to work with a pastry dolly for the first time. Finally, the showstopper challenge sees traditional American pies being prepared - before one more baker is eliminated from the competition. From 2012.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The second lot of five hopefuls try their hand at professional service, preparing lunch at the Grain Store, a London restaurant overseen by classically trained chef Bruno Loubet. With paying customers to satisfy, they soon feel the weight of responsibility - who will rise to the challenge? The hopefuls then have a chance to show what they have learnt by rustling up a dish in an invention test, choosing from an array of seasonal produce - but in an unexpected twist, they also present their food to renowned chef Marcus Wareing. He then helps John Torode and Gregg Wallace evaluate the five amateurs before they decide which one has gone far enough in the competition.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Marley &amp; Me</title>
    <desc lang="en">The Devil Wears Prada director David Frankel's light comedy/ drama - based on a best-selling autobiography - stars Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston as a pair of married journalists who welcome a truly unruly dog into their lives. Relocating to Florida, newlyweds John and Jenny Grogan end up working for rival newspapers, and it's soon obvious that Jenny has landed the more high-profile job. But when she starts to become broody, one of John's colleagues suggests they see how they cope with a puppy before trying for a baby. John duly picks a cute yellow Labrador Retriever as a gift for his spouse. It's quickly clear their acquisition is something of a double-edged sword: he's an untrainably anarchic source of destruction; but he also gives John the material for a wry newspaper column, which greatly increases his standing (and the paper's readership). The film follows the trajectory of the Grogans' marriage, through good times and bad, and the stuff of everyday life, with the dog providing comic relief and the leads turning in convincing, heart-warming performances(n)</desc>

But his adversaries are equally determined, and they will not stop until the newborn is dead. Now, in order to ensure that maniacal criminal mastermind Mr. Hertz (Paul Giamatti) and his gang of henchmen do not succeed in accomplishing their nefarious goal, Mr. Smith joins forces with a prostitute known as the Dairy Queen (Monica Bellucci), who specializes in lactation fetishes, and flees into the bowels of the city while facing almost certain death on every street corner(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Devil Wears Prada director David Frankel's light comedy/ drama - based on a best-selling autobiography - stars Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston as a pair of married journalists who welcome a truly unruly dog into their lives. Relocating to Florida, newlyweds John and Jenny Grogan end up working for rival newspapers, and it's soon obvious that Jenny has landed the more high-profile job. But when she starts to become broody, one of John's colleagues suggests they see how they cope with a puppy before trying for a baby. John duly picks a cute yellow Labrador Retriever as a gift for his spouse. It's quickly clear their acquisition is something of a double-edged sword: he's an untrainably anarchic source of destruction; but he also gives John the material for a wry newspaper column, which greatly increases his standing (and the paper's readership). The film follows the trajectory of the Grogans' marriage, through good times and bad, and the stuff of everyday life, with the dog providing comic relief and the leads turning in convincing, heart-warming performances(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Shoot 'Em Up</title>
    <desc lang="en">A mysterious loner assumes the responsibility of protecting a newborn from a group of men determined to kill the child in first-time director/screenwriter Michael Davis' nonstop, adrenaline-fueled action film. Mr. Smith (Clive Owen) is the last man that a parent would want to have looking after their child, yet after stumbling upon a blazing shoot-out, helping to birth a child amidst a hail of gunfire, and seeing the mother die before his eyes, he becomes determined to protect the young innocent at all costs. But his adversaries are equally determined, and they will not stop until the newborn is dead. Now, in order to ensure that maniacal criminal mastermind Mr. Hertz (Paul Giamatti) and his gang of henchmen do not succeed in accomplishing their nefarious goal, Mr. Smith joins forces with a prostitute known as the Dairy Queen (Monica Bellucci), who specializes in lactation fetishes, and flees into the bowels of the city while facing almost certain death on every street corner(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Hollywood Ending</title>
    <desc lang="en">A down-on-his luck auteur gets one more chance at the big time -- provided his neuroses don't swallow him whole -- in Woody Allen's 33rd feature release, Hollywood Ending. Allen plays Val Waxman, a one-time cinematic genius who's resorted to taking advertisement work to pay the bills for himself and his airhead live-in girlfriend, Lori (Debra Messing). Val finds his luck is about to change, however, when he receives the script for The City Never Sleeps, a period noir set against the backdrop of 1940s New York City. It seems his ex-wife, Ellie (Tea Leoni), now an executive at Galaxy Pictures, has been pulling for him to direct the picture, claiming he's the only man who can do justice to the script. She even manages to convince her boyfriend, Hal (Treat Williams), Galaxy's high-powered studio head, to take a chance on Val's "unique vision." Just when the cameras are ready to roll, however, Val finds that unique vision in jeopardy -- literally -- as he's struck with a psychosomatic case of blindness. When physicians and psychiatrists fail to cure him, Val contrives a scheme to forge ahead with the picture, for fear of blowing his one last chance at greatness. Hollywood Ending co-stars George Hamilton and Mark Rydell(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Golden Compass</title>
    <desc lang="en">Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig and Dakota Blue Richards star in Chris Weitz's family fantasy-adventure, based on the first book in Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy. Twelve-year-old orphan Lyra Belacqua lives in an Oxford college, where the staff do their best to push her enquiring mind down conventional educational routes. One day, having sneaked into a private meeting of the college's dons, Lyra learns of mysterious events taking place in the Arctic. Soon after, amid news of mysterious child abductors called the 'Gobblers', her best friend Roger (Ben Walker) vanishes. The fearless Lyra sets off, determined to rescue her playmate. But Lyra's is a parallel universe: one with Victorian-style technology; where people's souls take the visible form of character-suggesting animals; witches and talking, armoured polar bears rule the cold lands of the north; and an organisation called The Magisterium aims to assert its authority. Lyra's journey will prove a dangerous one that uncovers the terrible truth linking the Gobblers and the Arctic phenomenon she heard about in Oxford. Also starring Eva Green, and the voices of Freddie Highmore and Ian McKellan. Sadly, it now seems the following two films in the series are fated not to be made. Even so, this stands as a stirring, thoughtful family adventure that's reasonably true to Pullman's masterpiece(n)</desc>

Alicia (Mia Kirshner), Hadley (Meredith Monroe), Julianne (Rachel True), and Sydney (Dominique Swain) are four students enrolled in the same sociology class at Colby University, an exclusive and respected college in the Carolinas. Alicia is a local girl born into modest circumstances who struggles to make ends meet and rarely gets a second look from the male students on campus, while Hadley, Julianne, and Sydney are close friends who all come from wealthy families and seem more concerned with partying than their studies. Alicia and Hadley are paired up to work on their semester project for the class, which is to be centered around the theme "Lead, Follow, or Get Out of the Way." As part of the project, Hadley decides to befriend Alicia, and brings her into her social circle. At first, Alicia seems more than grateful for the attention of her new friends, and blooms under the influence of Hadley, Julianne, and Sydney. But it isn't long before Alicia's personality begins to shift; she develops a powerful appetite for drugs and alcohol, and soon begins taking advantage of her new friendships. Things come to a head when Alicia seduces Sydney's boyfriend, Josh (Oliver Hudson), and soon Alicia ends up in the hospital after OD'ing on drugs. Artie Bonner (Taye Diggs), a local sheriff, begins looking into Alicia's case, convinced that her near-fatal accident with drugs was no accident at all(n)</desc>

Mr. Smith (Clive Owen) is the last man that a parent would want to have looking after their child, yet after stumbling upon a blazing shoot-out, helping to birth a child amidst a hail of gunfire, and seeing the mother die before his eyes, he becomes determined to protect the young innocent at all costs. But his adversaries are equally determined, and they will not stop until the newborn is dead. Now, in order to ensure that maniacal criminal mastermind Mr. Hertz (Paul Giamatti) and his gang of henchmen do not succeed in accomplishing their nefarious goal, Mr. Smith joins forces with a prostitute known as the Dairy Queen (Monica Bellucci), who specializes in lactation fetishes, and flees into the bowels of the city while facing almost certain death on every street corner(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">An upstanding businessman finds his upcoming marriage thrown into question when his connection with a down-on-her-luck cleaning woman turns unexpectedly romantic. Wesley Deeds (Tyler Perry) is a prominent businessman who has successfully taken the reins of the family business. He displays commendable patience while dealing with his insubordinate brother and strives to give his demanding fiancée, Natalie (Gabrielle Union), a happy, stable future. Up until now, Wesley's life has been comfortable, but the moment he meets Lindsey (Thandie Newton), everything starts to change. A proud single mother who has just gotten evicted and now struggles to give her daughter some much-needed stability, Lindsey never asked for a handout in her life. But when Wesley offers to lend the outspoken custodian the help that she needs to get her life back together, their friendly bond quickly develops into something much deeper. Now, with his heart and his head pulling in different directions, Wesley realizes that his entire future may not be as predictable as he once thought(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Tony Robinson and the team head to the Lake District to look for copper, a forgotten piece of the nation's industrial heritage. There are nearly two dozen old mines across the mountains, some thought to have been established 400 years ago when the valleys would have been studded with workshops, scaffolding and water-powered machines, home to a brave band of Tudor miners. The team battles the rain, wind and dangerously unstable trackways, but the combination of sheer effort and hi-tech kit enables the experts to access the heart of an old mine.(n)</desc>

To prove to Joey that she is capable of performing a good deed with no strings attached, Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) makes a large donation to PBS -- even though she has good reason to despise the network (it has something to do with Sesame Street never answering her letter). Chandler (Matthew Perry) overplays his hand when he overhears Monica (Courteney Cox) discussing her terrific "secret" boyfriend with Rachel (Jennifer Aniston). And Emily (Helen Baxendale) finally contacts her husband, Ross (David Schwimmer), begging him to move to London -- but what will Rachel say?(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Alpha Dog</title>
    <desc lang="en">A drug dealer moves on to bigger crimes in an effort to settle a score with disastrous results in this drama inspired by actual events. Though barely out of his teens, Johnny Truelove (Emile Hirsch) has already built a lucrative career for himself selling drugs -- he has his own home, a luxury car, and posse of friends who do double duty as his crew, including Elvis (Shawn Hatosy), Frankie (Justin Timberlake), and Tiko (Fernando Vargas). While life at Johnny's house is usually a constant party interrupted by occasional dope deals, Johnny has lost all of his patience with Jake Mazursky (Ben Foster), a regular customer who has run up a large tab that he can't pay. Determined to clear Jake's account, Johnny and his boys plan to kidnap Jake and hold him for ransom, but when they happen upon his 15-year-old stepbrother, Zack (Anton Yelchin), they impulsively decide to take the youngster instead. Jake's father, Butch (David Thornton), and his stepmother, Olivia (Sharon Stone), are already furious with their junkie son when they learn about Zack's disappearance, and aren't sure what they should do. Meanwhile at Johnny's place, Frankie takes a liking to young Zack, who already admires his brother's high-flying lifestyle, and introduces the kid to the joys of grown-up partying, which he takes to with dangerous zeal. Also featuring Bruce Willis as Johnny's father, Alpha Dog was based on the real-life story of Jesse James Hollywood, who at the age of 21 became one of the youngest people to ever appear on the FBI's "Most Wanted" list(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A drug dealer moves on to bigger crimes in an effort to settle a score with disastrous results in this drama inspired by actual events. Though barely out of his teens, Johnny Truelove (Emile Hirsch) has already built a lucrative career for himself selling drugs -- he has his own home, a luxury car, and posse of friends who do double duty as his crew, including Elvis (Shawn Hatosy), Frankie (Justin Timberlake), and Tiko (Fernando Vargas). While life at Johnny's house is usually a constant party interrupted by occasional dope deals, Johnny has lost all of his patience with Jake Mazursky (Ben Foster), a regular customer who has run up a large tab that he can't pay. Determined to clear Jake's account, Johnny and his boys plan to kidnap Jake and hold him for ransom, but when they happen upon his 15-year-old stepbrother, Zack (Anton Yelchin), they impulsively decide to take the youngster instead. Jake's father, Butch (David Thornton), and his stepmother, Olivia (Sharon Stone), are already furious with their junkie son when they learn about Zack's disappearance, and aren't sure what they should do. Meanwhile at Johnny's place, Frankie takes a liking to young Zack, who already admires his brother's high-flying lifestyle, and introduces the kid to the joys of grown-up partying, which he takes to with dangerous zeal. Also featuring Bruce Willis as Johnny's father, Alpha Dog was based on the real-life story of Jesse James Hollywood, who at the age of 21 became one of the youngest people to ever appear on the FBI's "Most Wanted" list(n)</desc>

In this macabre story, Shaun (Simon Pegg) is down in the dumps, going through an unstoppable crisis in his life. About to turn 30, he passes the time in The Winchester bar, dislikes his job, argues with his mother every day, and the relationship with his girlfriend, Liz (Kate Ashfield), worsens by the hour. When she finally leaves him, Shaun decides, once and for all, to do something about his life. His first step is not visiting a psychologist, but confronting an invasion of living dead with just two weapons: a cricket bat and a shovel! Zombies Party is -at the same time- a parody and a tribute to zombie films(n)</desc>

One day, Buck makes the news after he accidentally stops a gang of bank robbers from getting away with the loot, and his brief moment of celebrity attracts the attention of Many Liu (Eric Tsang), a low-rent private detective who's looking for help with a missing person's case. One of Many's clients is looking for his long-lost son, and Many thinks Buck is just the guy to help track him down. Buck signs on, and is sent to Korea, where he meets a mysterious man named Mr. Park; Buck doesn't think he's the man Many wants, but he wonders if he might be his own father, who disappeared when he was a child. Buck makes the acquaintance of Carmen (Kim Min-jeong), an attractive journalist who tips off Buck that Mr. Park is actually an infamous North Korean espionage agent; Buck confronts Mr. Park, who has suddenly fallen ill, and Park on his deathbed tells Buck a riddle that, if properly decoded, could lead him to a great fortune. As Buck and Carmen try to unravel the mystery of Mr. Park's final words, their adventures lead them to Istanbul, where the fate of millions is suddenly put into Buck's hands when he discovers a deadly biological weapon coveted by Mr. Zen (Wu Hsing-kuo), a ruthless Chinese crime boss.

    <title lang="en">Doom</title>
    <desc lang="en">One of the most popular and influential video games ever makes its way to the big screen in this sci-fi thriller. A coalition of Earth's scientific and military interests have established a research colony called Olduvai on the planet Mars, but one day all communication from the outpost stops and no one can tell what has happened -- though the final messages suggest it's not good. Believing foul play may have overtaken Olduvai's crew, the Rapid Response Tactical Squad, a team of specially trained military personnel, are deployed to investigate the situation and, if necessary, eliminate the invaders. But Sarge (Dwayne Johnson, aka The Rock) and Reaper (Karl Urban), leaders of the RRTS team, soon discover the situation is far more grim than they could have imagined. An experiment on Olduvai has very literally opened a portal to Hades, and a variety of savage and demonic creatures have overtaken the colony. Now the RRTS must seal off Olduvai, close off any access to Earth, and exterminate the satanic beasts before they can kill again. Doom also stars Rosamund Pike (as Dr. Grimm), Dexter Fletcher, Ben Daniels, and Deobia Oparei(n)</desc>

After diving into the ocean and realizing to their horror that they have forgotten to lower the safety ladder, the friends who had set out for a simple weekend getaway realize that they have become helplessly stranded in the middle of the ocean. The sheer sides of the yacht are impossible to climb, and now the group is growing increasingly desperate. As the grim reality of their helpless situation slowly begins to dawn on the doomed friends, hydrophobic Amy (Susan May Pratt) struggles to maintain her composure after realizing that her baby daughter Sarah is helpless and alone aboard the boat. Now treading water as panic begins to set in, the once inseparable friends fast begin to turn on one another as exhaustion begins to set in and the vast ocean threatens to swallow the entire group without a trace(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">On Her Majesty's Secret Service</title>
    <desc lang="en">Supposedly, when Sean Connery refused to star in another James Bond movie, producers Harry Saltzman and Albert Broccoli vowed to show up the insolent Connery by literally "creating" a new Bond from the ground up. That's why professional model and TV commercial-spokesman George Lazenby is cast as 007 in the 1969 filmization of Ian Fleming's 1963 Bond novel On Her Majesty's Secret Service. As a result, the film is one of the few in the series that could boast more than a passing resemblance to the Fleming original. This time around, Bond quits the secret service when he is told to end his obsessive search for master criminal Blofeld (Telly Savalas). While trailing his quarry in Portugal, Bond falls in love with Tracy Draco (Diana Rigg), daughter of a notorious gangster (Gabriele Ferzetti). The elder Draco agrees to help Bond find Blofeld, with the implicit understanding that Bond will marry Tracy. Bond's mission takes him to a Swiss mountain retreat, wherein Blofeld is executing his master plan of destroying the world's agricultural economy. When all is said and done, Bond does marry Tracy, but the honeymoon ends in sudden tragedy(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Hot Chick</title>
    <desc lang="en">A carefree young woman wakes up to discover her greatest nightmare is a reality -- she's become trapped in the body of Rob Schneider -- in this shape-shifting comedy. Jessica (Rachel McAdams) is a beautiful teenager whose life would be the envy of any high school student -- she's head of the cheerleading squad, her boyfriend, Billy (Matthew Lawrence), is the quarterback of the football team, and she's pretty and popular enough to get nearly anyone to do what she wants. However, Jessica is soon to find out how the other half lives, in more ways than she counted upon; she shoplifts a pair of earrings from an shop specializing in African curios run by Mambuza (Angie Stone), unaware that they carry the curse of Princess Nawa. Thanks to the curse, the next morning Jessica awakes to find that her spirit has entered the body of Clive (Rob Schneider), a sweaty and hirsute small-time crook. As Jessica tries to figure out how she can return to her old body, she has to lead the cheerleading squad to victory and attend her senior prom while looking like a less-than-handsome 30-year-old man. Billy is understandably puzzled by the changes in Jessica, while her best friend, April (Anna Faris), finds her feelings about Jessica change a bit once she volunteers to be her prom date. The Hot Chick is the first theatrical feature for director Tom Brady; Brady co-wrote an earlier Schneider vehicle, The Animal, and was on the writing staff for his television series Men Behaving Badly(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Dark Girls</title>
    <desc lang="en">When Africans were first brought to the United States as slaves, many slave owners took a strange approach to diving the labor among the humans they owned -- lighter skinned blacks were assigned to work inside the house, performing more precise but less physically demanding chores, while their darker skinned brethren were forced to perform punishing manual labor in the fields. In the 21st Century, a grim vestige of this tradition lives on in African-American culture, as women with dark complexion often find themselves looked down upon by their peers, considered less attractive, less intelligent and less refined than women with a lighter skin tone. A variety of African-American women discuss this phenomenon, sharing their thoughts on the social and cultural implications of this subtle but common form of prejudice, in the documentary Dark Girls. Directors Bill Duke and D. Channsin Berry feature interviews with women sharing their own experiences as dark skinned African-Americans, children who reveal how young these beliefs are implanted in girls, and men who share their feelings about women and skin color. Dark Girls was an official selection at the 2011 Toronto Film Festival(n)</desc>

Hayek and Cruz play Sara and Maria, respectively -- two women whose fathers (one a banker, the other a peasant farmer) are each wiped out by a nasty, vile, gun-wielding swindler named Tyler Jackson (Sling Blade co-star and country music singer Dwight Yoakam). Jackson cuts a bloody swath across the Southwest as he reduces one bank after another to an impoverished trash heap. In revenge, these women (who sit at opposite ends of the personality spectrum) vow to beat Tyler at his own game by hitting and robbing each of the banks before their father's killer can reach them.

    <title lang="en">Bandidas</title>
    <desc lang="en">Latina heartthrobs Salma Hayek and Penélope Cruz co-headline the rousing indie Western Bandidas. The brainchild of producer/screenwriter Luc Besson (La Femme Nikita, The Big Blue), Bandidas marks one of only a handful of films in its genre (along with Bad Girls, Cattle Annie and Little Britches, and Johnny Guitar) to use women as its principals, and distinguishes itself further by adding hefty doses of comic relief to the Western formula. Hayek and Cruz play Sara and Maria, respectively -- two women whose fathers (one a banker, the other a peasant farmer) are each wiped out by a nasty, vile, gun-wielding swindler named Tyler Jackson (Sling Blade co-star and country music singer Dwight Yoakam). Jackson cuts a bloody swath across the Southwest as he reduces one bank after another to an impoverished trash heap. In revenge, these women (who sit at opposite ends of the personality spectrum) vow to beat Tyler at his own game by hitting and robbing each of the banks before their father's killer can reach them. Steve Zahn co-stars as the "criminal science" officer who aids the girls in their mission; Espen Sandberg and Joachim Roenning co-direct(n)</desc>

Qualls. Larry (the Cable Guy) has lost his job and his woman in the short span of 24 hours. Convinced that some suds and target shooting are just the right remedies for a broken, jobless heart, Larry sets out with his next-door neighbor Bill (Engvall) and their trigger-happy pal Everett (Qualls) in order to blast off some rounds and down some brews. Their relaxing weekend soon takes an unexpected turn, however, when hard-case Army sergeant Kilgrove (Keith David) mistakes the trio as slacking Army reservists and loads them in a plane bound for Fallujah. Subsequently air-dropped over Mexico due to pilot error, the clueless, wannabe war heroes become convinced that they're actually in the Middle East and set out to save a rural village from what they assume to be an insurgent uprising. Though the thankful locals champion the noble but dimwitted trio for their heroism, the celebration is short-lived as ruthless warlord Carlos Santana (Danny Trejo) pays a personal visit to the town with a plan to confront the fearless warriors who dared to challenge his iron-fist rule(n)</desc>

It's the story of diaper-clad kids, told from a baby's point- of-view, and they were one of the hottest-selling toy franchises of the late '90s. The film features a hilarious musical number in the hospital nursery, where newborns have the voices of major rock stars that include Jakob Dylan (Bob Dylan's son), Iggy Pop, Lou Rawls, Lisa Loeb, and Patti Smith, to name a few. The story escalates when self-proclaimed leader Tommy Pickles is thrust into an impossible situation with the birth of his new brother, Dil Pickles. This new kid is grabbing all the attention and won't stop crying. With the help of other toddlers Lil and Phil, Tommy decides that the baby should be returned to the hospital for fixing. They all hop on their little wagon and take a high-speed ride straight into the deep woods where they realize they're lost. Chased around by animals (or so they think), the Rugrats clan must get home in one piece. Other celebrity voices include Whoopi Goldberg and The Rocky Horror Picture Show's Tim Curry, as well as Saturday Night Live's Andrea Martin and David Spade(n)</desc>

Larry Blyden stars in this hilarious Twilight Zone entry as egocentric TV western star Rance McGrew, who, while filming a fight scene, is knocked cold by a prop bottle. Upon awakening, Rance finds himself in the real west, circa 1880 -- and at the mercy of none other than Jesse James (Arch Johnson). It seems that old Jesse isn't too thrilled as to how he and his fellow outlaws have been depicted on Rance's series, and he intends to teach the vainglorious actor a lesson. Best line: "And you won an Emmy? Shoot, you can't act any better than you can draw!" This episode reunited two alumni of the classic 1951 sci-fi thriller The Thing: actor Robert Cornthwaite, and director Christian Nyby. Scripted by Rod Serling from an idea by Frederic Louis Fox (which in its original form wasn't a comedy at all), "Showdown with Rance McGrew" first aired February 2, 1962(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Stakeout. This episode of NBC's Seinfeld was the first of the show's first season, although the pilot had aired one year prior and another episode ("Male Unbonding") was actually taped before this one. Nonetheless, this show gave viewers their first introduction to Jerry's ex-girlfriend Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfuss), who was not in the pilot. It also saw Michael Richards' character called Kramer for the first time -- he'd been known as Kessler in the first episode. Originally airing May 31, 1990, "The Stakeout" found Jerry and George planning an elaborate ruse to "accidentally" bump into a woman whom Jerry had met but failed to get a phone number or last name from. As part of the ploy, George created the pseudonym Art Vandelay, a moniker that would come up several times throughout the series' life. Philip Bruns guest starred as Jerry's father, Morty, a role that would later be taken over by Barney Martin(n)</desc>

The weekend is ruined when all three ladies simultaneously have their periods! Listen for the reference to series star Ed O'Neill's first film Deliverance.

Ultimately, however, the episode was telecast more and less intact, though its title was changed to "The Camping Show" (a pointless gesture, in that the series' episode titles were never shown onscreen) and it was aired one hour later than its usual 8:30 p.m. time slot(n)</desc>
