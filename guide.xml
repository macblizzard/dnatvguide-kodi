    <title lang="en">Rachael Ray</title>
    <desc lang="en">Assembled for television by Oprah Winfrey's production company, the daily, hour-long talkfest Rachael Ray starred the former host of several Food Network programs, the author of several best-selling cookbooks, and the maven of many a popular franchised cooking product. At first glance, Rachael Ray may have seemed to be yet another Martha Stewart clone, but a closer examination revealed that Ray preferred to have a looser and more spontaneous format on her series than was seen on Martha's; also, though she certainly dispensed some cooking and housekeeping tips here and there, she did not confine herself to these domestic pursuit.

    <desc lang="en">Assembled for television by Oprah Winfrey's production company, the daily, hour-long talkfest Rachael Ray starred the former host of several Food Network programs, the author of several best-selling cookbooks, and the maven of many a popular franchised cooking product. At first glance, Rachael Ray may have seemed to be yet another Martha Stewart clone, but a closer examination revealed that Ray preferred to have a looser and more spontaneous format on her series than was seen on Martha's; also, though she certainly dispensed some cooking and housekeeping tips here and there, she did not confine herself to these domestic pursuit. The set of Rachael Ray was designed by the hostess herself as a "home away from home", complete with stove and plush chairs. Most of the guests on the series were specialized experts whom Ray had met and befriended during her previous TV life on the Food Network. Rachael Ray was first syndicated the week of September 18, 2006 by King World Productions(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Expendables</title>
    <desc lang="en">An all-star cast of action-movie icons headline Sylvester Stallone's explosive action thriller about a group of hard-nosed mercenaries who are double-crossed during a treacherous mission. Approached by the shadowy Church (Bruce Willis) to overthrow tyrannical South American dictator General Gaza (David Zayas) and restore order to the troubled island country of Vilena, stoic soldier of fortune Barney Ross (Stallone) rounds up an unstoppable team that includes former SAS soldier and blade specialist Lee Christmas (Jason Statham); martial arts expert Yin (Jet Li); trigger-happy Hale Caesar (Terry Crews); and cerebral demolitions expert Toll Road (Randy Couture). Traveling to Vilena on a reconnaissance mission with his old pal Christmas, Barney meets their local contact, a cagey guerrilla fighter named Sandra (Giselle Itie), and together the trio scopes out the landscape.. It isn't long before Barney and Christmas have discovered that their actual target is not General Gaza but James Monroe (Eric Roberts), a former CIA operative who has recently gone rogue. Monroe won't be easy to get to either, because his hulking bodyguard Paine (Steve Austin) is a force to be reckoned with. When their mission is compromised, Barney and Christmas are forced to flee, leaving Sandra behind to face almost certain death. But Barney isn't the kind of soldier to abandon a mission, or a hostage, and now in order to get the job done he'll need the help of his old crew(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Wild Dogs. Wild Dogs gives an inside look at how wild dogs operate as group hunters, analyzing everything from instinctive strategy and tactics, to the moment of capture. This is no easy task and to beat the competition, the pack must get creative. Well see these endangered predators employ three different lines of attack in order to feed their young and secure the next generation of wild dogs in Imfolozi. We follow the Shiyane pack of wild dogs as they try to catch elusive prey in South Africas Imfolozi Game Reserve. Two alpha dogs called Roxy and Lightfaze head this pack. Each brought along a few allies to this new coalition now ten dogs strong. Together the pack utilize 3 tactics to capture prey in order to feed the 10 adult members of the pack and their off spring. The cooperation and allegiance exhibited in the group hunt, is fundamental to the Shiyane packs survival. If the Shiyane pack expands, a few dogs will likely splinter off and mix into new packs, improving genetic diversity and strengthening the entire species(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Dead Woman Walking: The Karla Faye Tucker Story. This documentary, part of the American Justice series from A&amp;E, examines the Texas death penalty case of Karla Faye Walker. Narrated by American Justice host and producer Bill Kurtis, this episode goes inside the investigation of the two murders that Walker and her boyfriend Daniel Ryan Garrett committed. The trial of Walker is shown through exclusive footage. After the conviction, American Justice follows her through her daily life, showing her prison surroundings and talking with her about her crimes. Sentenced to death, while Walker was waiting to be executed, she became a born-again Christian. Her lawyers used this transformation as leverage to try to get her death sentence reduced to life in prison. Their attempts were unsuccessful and Walker was killed by lethal injection in February 1998. American Justice also shows interviews with lawyers and law enforcement professionals who knew Walker(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Looper</title>
    <desc lang="en">A hired gun from the future discovers that his greatest adversary is himself in this twisting sci-fi mindbender starring Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and directed by Rian Johnson (Brick, The Brothers Bloom). In the year 2047 time travel has yet to be invented. Thirty years later, however, it has. Though immediately outlawed, time-travel technology is quickly appropriated by the mob, and used to cleanly dispose of anyone deemed a threat. The process is simple: When the mob wants someone to disappear, they simply send them back to the year 2047, where an assassin known as a "looper" quickly carries out the hit, and disposes of the body. Joe Simmons (Gordon-Levitt) is one of the most respected loopers around. Each kill earns him a big payday, and he's got big plans to retire to France. Then, one day, as Joe patiently awaits the appearance of his next target near the edge of a remote corn field, he's shocked to come face-to-face with his future self (Bruce Willis). When the younger Joe hesitates, the older Joe makes a daring escape. Now, in order to avoid the wrath of his underworld boss (Jeff Daniels), young Joe must "close the loop" and kill his older counterpart. Meanwhile, the revelation that a powerful crime boss in the future has set the underworld ablaze pits the two Joes on a violent collision course, with the fate of a devoted mother (Emily Blunt) and her young son hanging in the balance.

    <desc lang="en">A booze-swilling, pot-smoking, hard-swearing seventh-grade teacher rallies to get out of the classroom for good by wrangling a rich substitute teacher into marriage in this comedy from director Jake Kasdan (Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story). Cynical teacher Elizabeth (Cameron Diaz) hates her job. She can't wait for the day she finds a man who makes enough cash to let her walk away from her life of middle-school misery, and when her fiancé cancels their wedding plans, her frantic search intensifies. Just when it starts to look like Elizabeth will have to muscle her way through another semester of skull-crushing hangovers, however, handsome substitute Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake) shows up at school sporting a fancy wristwatch and the promise of a care-free future. But in order to earn her meal ticket, Elizabeth will have to out-cute perky fellow teacher Amy (Lucy Punch). And it won't be easy, because Scott is crushing on Amy hard. Now, if Elizabeth can just motivate her students to study so that she can win a state contest to earn enough cash for some new breast implants, perhaps she can finally find a means of diverting Scott's gaze. Meanwhile, much to Elizabeth's chagrin, wisecracking, self-effacing gym teacher Russell (Jason Segel) refuses to admit defeat despite being turned down for a date by his gold-digging colleague time and again(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">One of the most celebrated horror films of the late '70s is given a new look in this remake, produced by blockbuster filmmaker Michael Bay. George and Kathy Lutz (Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George) are a young couple who are looking for a new home, and think they've found a dream house in Amityville, Long Island -- a large and beautiful home available at a bargain price. George thinks that there must be a catch, and learns that the house has a dark history -- a year before, a man living in the house murdered his family in their sleep, claiming he was commanded to commit the crime by demons. Shrugging off stories that the house is haunted, George and Kathy move in with their three kids, only to discover that something evil lurks within the house, and even Father McNamara (Philip Baker Hall), an expert on possession, is powerless to clear the dark spirits from the home. The Amityville Horror was based on the same book by Jay Anson that provided the basis for the 1979 film, which in turn documented an actual incident(n)</desc>

The time is the 1960s, and singers Effie (Jennifer Hudson), Lorrell (Anika Noni Rose), and Deena (Beyoncé Knowles) are about to find out just what it's like to have their wildest dreams come true. Discovered at a local talent show by ambitious manager Curtis Taylor Jr. (Jamie Foxx), the trio known as "the Dreamettes" is soon offered the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of opening for popular singer James "Thunder" Early (Eddie Murphy). Subsequently molded into an unstoppable hit machine by Taylor and propelled into the spotlight as "the Dreams," the girls quickly find their bid for the big time taking priority over personal friendship as Taylor edges out the ultra-talented Effie so that the more beautiful Deena can become the face of the group. Now, as the crossover act continues to dominate the airwaves, the small-town girls with big-city dreams slowly begin to realize that the true cost of fame may be higher than any of them ever anticipated(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Pint-size rap music star Lil Bow Wow shows that he can play ball as well as he raps in this youth-oriented comedy about a young boy whose dream comes true in an unexpected way. Calvin Cambridge (Lil Bow Wow) is a 14-year-old boy, who, since the death of his parents, has been living in an orphanage run by the unpleasantly eccentric Stan Bittleman (Crispin Glover). While the tough but caring Sister Theresa (Anne Meara) tries to encourage the kids, Calvin knows that he and most of the other kids his age are poor prospects for adoption. Calvin loves basketball and idolizes Michael Jordan, but he's too short to be much of a challenge to the older kids when shooting hoop at the playground. One day, Calvin discovers a pair of old basketball sneakers with the initials "MJ" written on the inside. Calvin is convinced they once belonged to Michael Jordan, but he can hardly believe what happens when he puts them on -- suddenly he's able to make superhuman jump shots and dunks just like a miniature version of Air Jordan himself. Calvin's newly developed talent on the court comes to the attention of Frank Bernard (Eugene Levy), the manager of the Los Angeles Knights, an NBA team having a humiliating season. Bernard brings Calvin to the team as a novelty item, but with the help of Coach Wagner (Robert Forster) and the new kid's can-do attitude, the Knights start to climb out of the cellar and look like possible season champs. However, Tracey Reynolds (Morris Chestnut), who used to be the team's star player, isn't happy to have his thunder stolen by a 14-year-old boy -- especially when he's made Calvin's roommate and de-facto guardian on the road. Like Mike also features cameo appearances by a number of pro basketball stars, including Allen Iverson, Chris Webber, and Jason Kidd(n)</desc>

Calvin loves basketball and idolizes Michael Jordan, but he's too short to be much of a challenge to the older kids when shooting hoop at the playground. One day, Calvin discovers a pair of old basketball sneakers with the initials "MJ" written on the inside. Calvin is convinced they once belonged to Michael Jordan, but he can hardly believe what happens when he puts them on -- suddenly he's able to make superhuman jump shots and dunks just like a miniature version of Air Jordan himself. Calvin's newly developed talent on the court comes to the attention of Frank Bernard (Eugene Levy), the manager of the Los Angeles Knights, an NBA team having a humiliating season. Bernard brings Calvin to the team as a novelty item, but with the help of Coach Wagner (Robert Forster) and the new kid's can-do attitude, the Knights start to climb out of the cellar and look like possible season champs. However, Tracey Reynolds (Morris Chestnut), who used to be the team's star player, isn't happy to have his thunder stolen by a 14-year-old boy -- especially when he's made Calvin's roommate and de-facto guardian on the road. Like Mike also features cameo appearances by a number of pro basketball stars, including Allen Iverson, Chris Webber, and Jason Kidd(n)</desc>

When the politics of the situation change, so must Thorne's strategy. And what can Alice and he do about the attraction growing between them?(n)</desc>

On the surface, Po (voice of Black) may look like just another portly panda bear, but beneath his fur he bears the mark of the chosen one. By day, Po works faithfully in his family's noodle shop, but by night he dreams of becoming a true master of the martial arts. Now an ancient prophecy has come to pass, and Po realizes that he is the only one who can save his people from certain destruction. With time running short and malevolent snow leopard Tai Lung (Ian McShane ) closing in, Furious Five legends Tigress (Jolie), Crane (David Cross ), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu), Monkey (Chan), and their wise sensei, Master Shifu (Hoffman), all draw on their vast knowledge of fighting skills in order to transform a lumbering panda bear into a lethal fighting machine. Now, if the noble Po can master the martial arts and somehow transform his greatest weaknesses into his greatest strengths, he will fulfill his destiny as the hero who saved his people during their darkest hour(n)</desc>

But Costello begins to smell a rat and demands Sullivan get him the name of the insider while Costigan realises the net may be closing in before he can get the information he needs. Superb performances from the three leads, with Nicholson reined in by Scorsese, supplemented by Oscar-nominee Mark Wahlberg as the foul-mouthed Sgt Dignam and Martin Sheen as Captain Queenan, Costigan's handlers who Sullivan must get past to find out his identity(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The interstellar battle between the Autobots and Decepticons rains destruction down on planet Earth as director Michael Bay adapts Hasbro and Takara's popular Transformers franchise into a big-budget, live-action summer tentpole extravaganza in this ambitious sci-fi action feature starring Shia LaBeouf, Tyrese Gibson, Bernie Mac, John Turturro, Jon Voight, and, of course, Optimus Prime and Megatron. Long ago, on the planet of Cybertron, a massive, powerful alien race divided into two factions, the noble Autobots, and the devious Decepticons. They fought for the sole access to a talisman known as the Allspark, a cube with the capacity to grant infinite power, and eventually the Autobots smuggled it off the planet's surface, hiding it in an unknown location on Earth. Now, hundreds of years later, the Deceptacons have come looking for it, and if the Autobots don't find it first, the Earth will be enslaved or destroyed by the evil aliens' use of its massive power. The Autobots don't know where the cube was hidden, but the information may be stored in the most unlikely of sources, as a gangly young Earthling named Sam Witwicky (LaBeouf) who's just picked up his first car, has a strange connection to the Allspark's history, making him the unlikely ally of these enormous creatures, as they fight for humankind's survival and the chance to return home(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Monologist Eric Bogosian's one-man theater piece Talk Radio, co-written by Bogosian and Tad Savinar, is searingly brought to the screen by Oliver Stone. Bogosian plays provocateur radio talk-show host Barry Champlain, whose constant espousal of his inflammatory views and ceaseless hectoring of his callers and listeners reaps equal parts love and hate. As his program rolls on, Champlain is revealed to be just as screwed up as any of his fans, if not more. And then he pushes one caller just a bit too far. In co-adapting the play for the screen, Stone interweaves elements of Stephen Singular's factual book Talked to Death, the story of a liberal Denver radio personality who was murdered at the behest of a militant right-wing hate group. One word of warning: if you're not a fan of the sort of radio depicted herein, chances are you won't warm up to this film(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">K-19: The Widowmaker</title>
    <desc lang="en">Harrison Ford steps into a different sort of heroic action role in this suspense-drama, based on a true story. In 1961, with America and the Soviet Union locked in the bitter struggle of the Cold War, the Soviets initiated a crash course to build and launch their first ballistic nuclear submarine to stand against America's seagoing nuclear arsenal. While Capt. Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson) had initially been put in charge of the sub, after lengthy delays and numerous mechanical failures, military chief Marshal Zelentstov (Joss Ackland) dropped Polenin down a rung in the chain of command and named tough-as-nails Capt. Alexei Vostrikov (Harrison Ford) commander of the ship. While Polenin's pride is stung when Vostrikov is named skipper, his greatest concern is that the ship is unsafe and not yet ready for launch; Vostrikov and Zelentstov supersede his objections, and the sub sets sail on schedule. However, Polenin's fears prove to be horribly prescient; as they sail beneath the waters near the United States' Eastern Seaboard, the ship's nuclear reactor goes haywire at sea, and experiences a near meltdown. Polenin and Vostrikov realize that a nuclear disaster aboard the sub is a very real possibility, which could not only send a deadly dose of radiation across America's East Coast, but could result in an explosion (and subsequent missile release) that would likely launch World War III. The adversarial Polenin and Vostrikov must set aside their differences and sacrifice their own safety in the interest of protecting innocent lives around the world. K-19: The Widowmaker also stars Peter Sarsgaard, John Shrapnel, and Donald Sumpter(n)</desc>

Morgan is eager to search out the rest of the map and retrieve the riches, but the fragment she holds is in Latin. Morgan then buys a well-educated slave, William Shaw (Matthew Modine), who can read the ancient language and already has a taste for the criminal life.

As Morgan and Dawg battle each other over the fragments of the map, a British journalist (Maury Chaykin) covers their feud for the penny press.

    <title lang="en">In Good Company</title>
    <desc lang="en">Paul Weitz's comedy romance stars Dennis Quaid as Dan Forman, head of ad sales at a successful sports magazine. The magazine is taken over by media mogul Teddy K who installs Carter Duryea, a 26-year-old hotshot, as Dan's replacement. Duryea keeps the experienced Dan on as his assistant, a post Dan can't quit for financial reasons. But when Carter meets and starts dating Alex, Dan's daughter, the fatherly instinct kicks in... What could have been a vapid comedy is lifted by the three leads, in particular Grace, who portrays Duryea almost as a kid who doesn't know what he wants next or what he's got right now, while Johansson portrays Alex as a young woman with a brain rather than an airhead, leading to a film brimming with honest storytelling(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Filmmakers Linda Atkinson and Nick Doob present this affectionate portrait of dance icons Carmen de Lavallade and Geoffrey Holder, who fell in love back in 1954, and quickly went on to become a New York institution. The year they first met, de Lavallade was making a name for herself in modern dance, and Holder was a respected painter and dancer from Jamaica who had just risen to fame as the world-renowned choreographer of The Wiz. A marriage proposal quickly followed, and 50 years later the couple is still setting the world on fire. Archival footage and candid interviews offer a glimpse into the remarkable lives of the two consummate professionals who never let fame get in the way of true love(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Day</title>
    <desc lang="en">A small band of friends make an uneasy alliance with a mysterious lone wolf in this blend of horror and adventure. An unnamed catastrophe has turned the Earth into a wasteland, and as packs of feral cannibals wander the countryside, a dwindling number of survivors struggle to stay alive. Rick (Dominic Monaghan), Adam (Shawn Ashmore), Henson (Cory Hardrict), and Shannon (Shannyn Sossamon) have been journeying together for months and are the last living members of a much larger group. Mary (Ashley Bell) is a solitary woman who crossed paths with the survivors and is now traveling with them. She isn't interested in discussing her past or becoming friends, but the others learn she's a powerful ally in a fight. The travelers take shelter in a house, but are soon surrounded by cannibals; they quickly realize just how strong a warrior Mary can be, while also discovering the terrible truth that led her to wander alone. The Day was directed by Douglas Aarniokoski, who has accumulated extensive credits as an assistant director and helming second-unit material on major films(n)</desc>

Not only will he find out whether or not he's been accepted into Georgetown University, but he might also lose his virginity to his smoking-hot classmate. From the moment he arrives at school and becomes the target of the volleyball team's wrath, however, the entire day spirals into disaster. When all is said and done Rob falls asleep, and awakens to find the entire nightmarish day beginning all over again. Uncertain if he may be experiencing a psychotic episode, Rob attempts to play it cool until realizing that he needs to find a way out. Although his good pals Stanley and Gabrielle do their best to provide emotional support, it's brilliant 12-year-old grade-skipper Arthur who may actually hold the secret to breaking the cycle.

In occupied Italy, a group of mainly English PoWs are about to attempt to escape from their camp when a tough American Colonel, Joseph Ryan, is incarcerated with them. When he hears the details of their plot, he thinks it amounts to suicide, and blows their plans by telling the Italian guards. His action earns their hatred, and the moniker 'von Ryan'. But Ryan is eventually able to make it up to his comrades when he spies the opportunity to hijack a train to get them all to safety in Switzerland. But they've still got a lot of the Italian countryside to cover, with the Nazis and Fascists determined to stop them, plus more trouble than they were expecting from their fellow Allied forces.

    <title lang="en">Von Ryan's Express</title>
    <desc lang="en">Mark Robson's Second World War adventure stars Frank Sinatra as the leader of Allied prisoners of war attempting to slip the clutches of their captors. In occupied Italy, a group of mainly English PoWs are about to attempt to escape from their camp when a tough American Colonel, Joseph Ryan, is incarcerated with them. When he hears the details of their plot, he thinks it amounts to suicide, and blows their plans by telling the Italian guards. His action earns their hatred, and the moniker 'von Ryan'. But Ryan is eventually able to make it up to his comrades when he spies the opportunity to hijack a train to get them all to safety in Switzerland. But they've still got a lot of the Italian countryside to cover, with the Nazis and Fascists determined to stop them, plus more trouble than they were expecting from their fellow Allied forces. Also starring Trevor Howard(n)</desc>

They knew they were taking a risk by settling in uncharted territory, but the land was bountiful and the future looked bright. The one thing that these settlers didn't count on was the railroad. When the bullets start flying and the locals start dying, there's no sheriff to maintain the peace within a hundred miles. With no one to defend the peaceful pioneers but a retired gunslinger and an ageing rancher, this unlikely duo loads their pistols and prepares to become the only law this town has ever known(n)</desc>

A typhoon at sea has sunk a ship, leaving Alexander Holmes (Martin Sheen) as the highest ranking officer to survive. Commandeering a crowded lifeboat, Holmes must face the fact that the tiny vessel is in danger of floundering itself--and there's another typhoon on the way. Thus is Holmes forced to "play God", decided who among the passengers will allowed to remain in the lifeboat, and who will be cast overboard.

    <desc lang="en">An aging slacker and former sperm donor discovers that he is the biological father of 533 children, and that 142 of them have filed a lawsuit to learn his true identity in this Dreamworks comedy starring Vince Vaughn. Aside from the fact that he was a regular visitor at a fertility clinic 20 years ago, there's nothing particularly remarkable about David Wozniak (Vince Vaughn): He drives a meat-delivery truck for his father's butcher business, he can't seem to hold down a relationship, and lately he's taken to growing marijuana as a means of paying off an $80,000 debt. He's so inept at even the simplest things that his girlfriend Emma (Cobie Smulders) can't stand the sight of him after she reveals that she's pregnant with his child. When an attorney tracks David down and reveals that he is the biological father of 533 children, and that 142 of them have filed a lawsuit to learn his true identity, the former donor panics, recruiting his lawyer friend Brett (Chris Pratt) to defend the privacy agreements he signed at the clinic. When Brett returns with an envelope containing profiles of all 142 children named in the lawsuit, however, David can't help but look, and before long he's surreptitiously injecting himself into the lives of his unsuspecting offspring. Meanwhile, as he begins to grow excited at the prospect of having his own child, he finds that sometimes the best fathers are the men who seem the least fit for parenting(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The two remaining designers compete for a place in the quarter final, this time transforming two attic bedrooms in desirable 1960s riverside homes in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. Each contestant is given a very different brief, with one designer facing the challenge of delivering a modern bachelor pad style room for the homeowners' son. The other must create a hippy yet chic bedroom inspired by the colours of an Indian sari, but their decision to use a multi-coloured scheme and create bulky pieces of bespoke furniture casts doubt on their ability.

    <desc lang="en">The north-eastern region of the United States, known as New England, is the stage for one of the most incredible colour changes on the planet when the vivid greens of summer give way to the golds and reds of autumn. This film reveals how this vibrant fiesta is created by the battles between the trees and the forests inhabitants. Moose, chipmunks, rattlesnakes and a bizarre mixture of caterpillars all play a crucial role; but surprisingly the forest itself was made to be so colourful, thanks to a combination of hard work by beavers, ants and humans. Narrated by Domhnall Gleeson.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">10,000 BC: Two Tribes: The Final</title>
    <desc lang="en">As the social experiment nears its end, the tribes prepare to pack up camp and go home. But before that, archaeologist Klint Janulis sets them one final challenge - to build a monument as a legacy of their experience. Meanwhile, John has not given up hope of catching an animal and manages to wound a deer, but needs the rest of the party's help to track it down rather than let it escape. Then as they finally return to the 21st century, each of them pauses to consider what living in the Stone Age has meant for them and how it will affect their lives going forward. Last in the series.(n)</desc>

The team battles the rain, wind and dangerously unstable trackways, but the combination of sheer effort and hi-tech kit enables the experts to access the heart of an old mine.(n)</desc>

There are nearly two dozen old mines across the mountains, some thought to have been established 400 years ago when the valleys would have been studded with workshops, scaffolding and water-powered machines, home to a brave band of Tudor miners. The team battles the rain, wind and dangerously unstable trackways, but the combination of sheer effort and hi-tech kit enables the experts to access the heart of an old mine.(n)</desc>

Tony and the crew investigate de Ferrers' long-lost private quarters, but it takes three days of twists and turns to determine what the site looked like 900 years ago. To mark the visit, they also cast a giant Time Team horseshoe to add to the collection that has decorated the castle hall for half a millennium.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Professor Noel Fitzpatrick tends to a Newfoundland called Billy, who clocks up thousands of miles travelling back and forth from his home in Aberdeen for treatment on his legs. He also attempts to help Barney, a tiny Yorkshire terrier who has a deformity in his neck which is compressing his spinal cord. For owners Linda and Barry, Noel is their last chance, but the operation involves high-risk surgery with no guarantee of success. The vet also manages the needs of both Kelly and her pampered Chihuahua, Miranda.(n)</desc>

Clive, meanwhile, still smarting from his unsuccessful silk application, takes on a sensitive case with a new solicitor, the fiery and passionate George Duggan, and soon discovers he has more than met his match. Neil Stuke co-stars, with Phil Davis, Indira Varma and Frances Barber joining the cast.(n)</desc>
