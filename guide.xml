But on Christmas Eve, Chuck proposes marriage to Kelly right before embarking on a large assignment. On the assignment, a plane crash strands Chuck on a remote island, and his fast-paced life is slowed to a crawl, as he is miles removed from any human contact. Finding solace only in a volleyball that he befriends, Chuck must now learn to endure the emotional and physical stress of his new life, unsure of when he may return to the civilization he knew before. Cast Away reunites star Hanks with director Robert Zemeckis, their first film together since 1994's Oscar-winning Forrest Gump(n)</desc>

Though Gnomeo (James McAvoy) and Juliet (Emily Blunt) belong to feuding garden-gnome families, they meet and fall in love. But the clans' shared animosity is exacerbated when Tybalt (Jason Statham) dies in part because of actions taken by Gnomeo to defend a friend whom Tybalt was attacking. After getting some sage advice from a statue of William Shakespeare (Patrick Stewart), Gnomeo attempts to set things right, and win the heart of the lawn ornament he loves. The supporting cast includes the vocal talents of Michael Caine, Hulk Hogan, and Maggie Smith(n)</desc>

Harry Sweeny (Jamey Sheridan) is an aged but handsome divorcée with a grown son and a small business. He lives a comfortable life in a small town, where his main source of entertainment is stopping by the local diner to flirt with pretty waitress Muriel (Karen Young). But Harry's life hasn't always been this easy, and after getting a call from Tom Kelly (Steve Buscemi) he starts to remember why. Tom isn't long for this earth, and before he goes he seeks forgiveness from David Kagan, a fellow crewman that he and Harry knew from their Navy days. Unable to say no to an old friend, Harry sets out on a reluctant search for David, visiting old friends and drudging up painful memories in the process. Why does Tom feel like he needs David's forgiveness to pass on, and whose redemption is Harry searching for anyway?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Satirist Jim Arahams returned with this comedy spoofing the Godfather trilogy, and other films and TV, including Jurassic Park, Lord of the Dance, and Barney. The opening emulates a Saul Bass sequence with Anthony Cortino (Jay Mohr) in a flight amid flames much like Robert De Niro in the Casino credits. After flashbacks go back in time to Sicily, Coppola/Scorsese references abound. Young Vincenzo (Jason Fuchs) travels to America to later become the clumsy chief of organized crime (with the late Lloyd Bridges as the aging Vincenzo) with his sons -- short-fused Joey (Billy Burke) and educated Anthony. Tony's WASP fiancee is Diane (Christina Applegate), recalling Diane Keaton in the Coppola films. During the wedding, assassins try to do away with Don Vincenzo, who's hospitalized, so Tony sets out to gain revenge for the murder attempt. In Vegas, Tony gets involved with showgirl Pepper (Pamela Gidley). When betrayals begin, can violence be far behind? This was Lloyd Bridges' final movie, and the film is dedicated to him(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Johnson Family Vacation</title>
    <desc lang="en">Comedian Cedric the Entertainer serves as both producer and star of this comedy about a family who discovers just how much can go wrong en route to a family get-together. When Nate Johnson (Cedric the Entertainer) is invited to a big family reunion in Missouri, he sees it as an opportunity to reconnect with his estranged wife and growing children, as well as a chance to show up his wealthier know-it-all brother, Mack (Steve Harvey). Nate takes delivery on an expensive new SUV, persuades his recently separated wife, Dorothy (Vanessa L. Williams), to tag along, and packs up his three kids -- nubile teenager Nikki (Solange Knowles), under-age wannabe rapper D.J. (Bow Wow), and precocious seven-year-old Destiny (Gabby Soleil) -- for what he imagines will be a leisurely drive from Los Angeles to St. Louis. However, between his wary wife, arguing kids, angry police officers, bizarre hitchhikers, bad diner food, and an unfortunate run-in with a cement mixer, getting from point A to point B proves to be just short of a nightmare. Johnson Family Vacation was the first feature film for director Christopher Erskin, who previously distinguished himself directing music videos for the likes of Missy Elliot, TLC, and Boyz II Men(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A ragtag group of juvenile delinquents assigned the task of cleaning up an abandoned hotel find out just how deadly community service can be when they are stalked by a monstrous, four-hundred-pound maniac with a grudge in director Gregory Dark's wrestling-infused survival horror flick. It was a mere four years ago that seven-foot menace Jacob Goodnight (WWE superstar Kane) was shot in the head and left for dead by a local police officer. But Jacob wasn't going down that easy. With a steel plate subsequently attached to his skull and ten razor-sharp fingernails ready to scrape grey matter from the skulls of his victims, Jacob retreated to the abandoned Blackwell Hotel, where he resided in the darkened, rotting hallways while planning his ultimate revenge. As fate would have it, Jacob wouldn't have to go far to satiate his raging bloodlust, though, and as the unsuspecting teens make their way through the crumbling corridors of the once-luxurious inn guided by the very same policeman who fired that misguided bullet years earlier, the notorious killer sharpens his nails, stalks his prey, and prepares for a little payback(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Daredevil</title>

During his childhood, an accident involving toxic waste blinded Murdock, but it also enhanced his other senses and gave him a kind of 'radar vision'. The incident was partially caused by his discovery that his father was involved with the Mob. Now, the adult Murdock, spurred partly by Catholic guilt over his role in his father's death, has dedicated this life to fighting crime and protecting the innocent. By day Murdock's a defence lawyer, but by night he dispenses summary justice to criminals who've escaped the courts. Things get complicated when he falls in love with Elektra Natchios. Not only is she the daughter of a man with connections to New York crime bosses but, unknown to Murdock, she's also a vigilante who's equally keen on figure-hugging leather (black in her case). And when Daredevil is framed for the murder of her father, Elektra swears vengeance on the masked crime-fighter (not realising that he's her lover).

    <desc lang="en">Jesse Eisenberg stars in the triple-Oscar-winning fictionalised account of the tetchy story behind Facebook's birth. Directed by David Fincher, it was inspired by Ben Mezrich's book The Accidental Billionaires and written by Aaron Sorkin, the sharp wordsmith of television's The West Wing. The gripping drama kicks off with neurotic Harvard computer science student Mark Zuckerberg drunkenly creating a misogynistic website called Facemash in revenge for being dumped by his girlfriend Erica. Once the hangover has worn off, Zuckerberg realises he may have the germ of a nifty idea, as long as he shifts the focus from settling scores to social interaction. Events unfold partly through chronological flashback and partly via later courtroom testimony, as the tale of friendships and business partnerships made and broken is told from the points of view of those involved. Sorkin's smart, humorous script propels the film with a kinetic energy. Also starring Andrew Garfield, Armie Hammer and Justin Timberlake(n)</desc>

Owner John Esposito left school at the age of 14 and has worked at his parents' restaurant, Sal's Pizzeria, ever since.

But when he lost his father as well, John became overwhelmed by the responsibility of running both establishments and his livelihood is at risk.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Carol Fuchs adapts writer/director Sandra Nettelbeck's screenplay for the 2001 romantic drama Mostly Martha for this Scott Hicks directed remake starring Catherine Zeta-Jones, Aaron Eckhart, and Patricia Clarkson. Kate Armstrong (Jones) is the master chef who is equally intense both in and out of the kitchen. Though Kate's "Type A" personality serves her well when whipping up meals in the trendy Manhattan eatery where she has made a name for herself, it threatens to sink her when she is named as the guardian of her nine-year-old niece Zoe (Little Miss Sunshine's Abigail Breslin). To complicate matters, an impetuous new sous chef named Nick Palmer (Eckhart) has recently joined the kitchen staff and his freewheeling personality seems to stand in direct opposition to Kate's unwavering perfectionism. Yet, despite the fact that they couldn't be more different on the surface, there's no denying the strong attraction between Kate and Nick. As the rivalry between the competitive cooks gradually gives way to romance, the lessons learned by compromising in the kitchen reveal to Kate the importance of learning to openly express herself in order to truly connect with Zoe and find romance with the good-natured Nick(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Carol Fuchs adapts writer/director Sandra Nettelbeck's screenplay for the 2001 romantic drama Mostly Martha for this Scott Hicks directed remake starring Catherine Zeta-Jones, Aaron Eckhart, and Patricia Clarkson. Kate Armstrong (Jones) is the master chef who is equally intense both in and out of the kitchen. Though Kate's "Type A" personality serves her well when whipping up meals in the trendy Manhattan eatery where she has made a name for herself, it threatens to sink her when she is named as the guardian of her nine-year-old niece Zoe (Little Miss Sunshine's Abigail Breslin). To complicate matters, an impetuous new sous chef named Nick Palmer (Eckhart) has recently joined the kitchen staff and his freewheeling personality seems to stand in direct opposition to Kate's unwavering perfectionism. Yet, despite the fact that they couldn't be more different on the surface, there's no denying the strong attraction between Kate and Nick. As the rivalry between the competitive cooks gradually gives way to romance, the lessons learned by compromising in the kitchen reveal to Kate the importance of learning to openly express herself in order to truly connect with Zoe and find romance with the good-natured Nick(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">On Her Majesty's Secret Service</title>
    <desc lang="en">Supposedly, when Sean Connery refused to star in another James Bond movie, producers Harry Saltzman and Albert Broccoli vowed to show up the insolent Connery by literally "creating" a new Bond from the ground up. That's why professional model and TV commercial-spokesman George Lazenby is cast as 007 in the 1969 filmization of Ian Fleming's 1963 Bond novel On Her Majesty's Secret Service. As a result, the film is one of the few in the series that could boast more than a passing resemblance to the Fleming original. This time around, Bond quits the secret service when he is told to end his obsessive search for master criminal Blofeld (Telly Savalas). While trailing his quarry in Portugal, Bond falls in love with Tracy Draco (Diana Rigg), daughter of a notorious gangster (Gabriele Ferzetti). The elder Draco agrees to help Bond find Blofeld, with the implicit understanding that Bond will marry Tracy. Bond's mission takes him to a Swiss mountain retreat, wherein Blofeld is executing his master plan of destroying the world's agricultural economy. When all is said and done, Bond does marry Tracy, but the honeymoon ends in sudden tragedy(n)</desc>

Racial tensions run high in the department as some of J.J.'s fellow officers resent his presence. His only real friend is the other new trooper, the first female officer to work there, who also suffers similar discrimination in the otherwise all-white-male work environment. When J.J. becomes increasingly aware of police corruption during the murder trial of Teddy Woods, who he helped to arrest, he faces difficult decisions and puts himself into grave personal danger in the service of justice(n)</desc>

Leeloo (Milla Jovovich) is the 'Fifth Element', a being who represents all that is good in the universe. Every 5,000 years, a doorway between two parallel dimensions opens which allows the forces of darkness to strike back at the forces of good in this dimension.

    <title lang="en">The Abyss</title>
    <desc lang="en">Approved by director James Cameron, The Abyss - Special Edition is an extended director's cut of the 1989 underwater science fiction epic, reinstating nearly a half hour of footage removed from the original release under studio pressure. The plot remains the same: the crew of an experimental, high-tech submersible is called into action to investigate a mysterious nuclear submarine crash. A series of strange encounters leads the crew to suspect the accident was caused by an extraterrestrial craft, and that they may be participating in an encounter with an alien species. However, in order to make contact, they must not only brave the abyss, an exceedingly deep underwater canyon, but also deal with the violent actions of one of their own crew members, an increasingly paranoid Navy SEAL officer. Much of the restored footage places these events in a grander political context, as the crew's mission becomes a factor in the dangerous escalation of nuclear tension between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The largest change involves the film's ending, which provides further information on the aliens' mission on Earth, bringing the film to closer to Cameron's intention: a modern remake of Robert Wise's The Day the Earth Stood Still(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Jay Hernandez, Jennifer Carpenter, and Johnathon Schaech star in this remake of Jaume Balagueró and Paco Plaza's successful, Spanish-language horror film [REC], which follows a television reporter and her cameraman as they fall under a mysterious quarantine issued on an inner-city apartment building. Television reporter Angela Vidal (Carpenter) and her trusty cameraman (Steve Harris) were documenting a night in the life of a Los Angeles fire station crew when the firefighters were summoned to a nearby apartment building to answer a routine 911 call. Upon arriving at the scene, Angela and company discover that police have already arrived to investigate the blood-curdling screams ringing out from one of the apartments. One of the women living in the building has been infected with something terrible, but what? When a few of the other residents are viciously attacked, they try to escape and discover that the CDC has quarantined the building. The officials in charge won't relay any information to those trapped inside the building, and it's impossible to seek information from the outside since telephone, Internet, television, and cell-phone access have all been cut off. By the time the quarantine is lifted, the intrepid cameraman's chilling footage provides the only evidence of the horrors that unfolded on that terrible night(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Another chance to see the 2012 contest, as presenters Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins invite 12 enthusiastic bakers to take part in a contest to determine which of them is Britain's best amateur, facing challenges devised by judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood. To begin with, they tackle an upside down cake, before following Paul's recipe for rum babas, a hybrid of cake and enriched dough that baffles some of the competitors. Finally, they are challenged to produce a show-stopping cake that reveals a hidden design when sliced into. Who will be first to leave?.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The 10 remaining amateur cooks' tart-making abilities are put to the test in the third round of the competition. Their first task is to bake a tarte Tatin, with judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry looking for intriguing flavour combinations to tickle their tastebuds. The hopefuls then face another daunting technical challenge as they try to replicate Mary's seemingly straightforward recipe for treacle tart, but the delicate task of adding a lattice top leaves some contestants flummoxed. Finally, they try to create an ornate fruit tart fit for gracing the window display of a leading patisserie - before discovering the identities of the latest Star Baker and the person who will be heading home.

The hopefuls start by creating tortes before tackling this week's technical test - the delicate French dish of creme caramel. Though these two rounds provide a stern examination of the amateurs' creative flair and technical ability, they then face possibly the toughest task of the series so far - a six-hour challenge to create a show-stopping layered meringue. Once the sugar has set, who will be this week's Star Baker, and who will be going home? Presented by Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins. From 2012.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Four bakers remain in the hunt for the title of Britain's best amateur baker, but they all need to raise their game when they tackle a trio of classic patisserie confections in the semi-final. A petits fours-making challenge provides an early test of nerves, before the quartet face the toughest technical task in the show's history - creating a fraisier, a sponge cake filled with mousse and strawberries. As tempers rise and confidence falters, the contestants have one last chance to impress judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry by baking a showstopping choux gateau - before discovering who has earned a place in the 2012 final. Presented by Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">After weeks of pastries, cakes and sponges, collapsing gingerbread houses and dodgy doughnuts, there are only three remaining bakers. But only one can be crowned the winner, and to prove they have what it takes the finalists face their most demanding challenges yet. Over two days, they must create a perfect pithivier, or puff-pastry pie, before making fondant fancies and their last showstopper - the notoriously difficult chiffon sponge. Only then will judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry decide who deserves the 2012 title. Presented by Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Another chance to see the 2012 contest, as presenters Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins invite 12 enthusiastic bakers to take part in a contest to determine which of them is Britain's best amateur, facing challenges devised by judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood. To begin with, they tackle an upside down cake, before following Paul's recipe for rum babas, a hybrid of cake and enriched dough that baffles some of the competitors. Finally, they are challenged to produce a show-stopping cake that reveals a hidden design when sliced into. Who will be first to leave?.(n)</desc>

The hopefuls then tackle a demanding technical challenge as they try to replicate Paul's recipe for an eight-strand plaited loaf, before receiving the dubious honour of becoming the first contestants in the show's history to make bagels. At the end of the day, Paul and Mary must decide who is this round's Star Baker - and who will be going home. Presented by Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins. From 2012.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The 10 remaining amateur cooks' tart-making abilities are put to the test in the third round of the competition. Their first task is to bake a tarte Tatin, with judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry looking for intriguing flavour combinations to tickle their tastebuds. The hopefuls then face another daunting technical challenge as they try to replicate Mary's seemingly straightforward recipe for treacle tart, but the delicate task of adding a lattice top leaves some contestants flummoxed. Finally, they try to create an ornate fruit tart fit for gracing the window display of a leading patisserie - before discovering the identities of the latest Star Baker and the person who will be heading home.

The hopefuls start by creating tortes before tackling this week's technical test - the delicate French dish of creme caramel. Though these two rounds provide a stern examination of the amateurs' creative flair and technical ability, they then face possibly the toughest task of the series so far - a six-hour challenge to create a show-stopping layered meringue. Once the sugar has set, who will be this week's Star Baker, and who will be going home? Presented by Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins. From 2012.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Erin Brockovich</title>
    <desc lang="en">Julia Roberts stars in this legal drama based on the true story of a woman who helped win the largest settlement ever paid in a direct-action lawsuit. Erin Brockovich (Roberts) is a single mother of three who, after losing a personal injury lawsuit, asks her lawyer, Ed Masry (Albert Finney), if he can help her find a job. Ed gives her work as a file clerk in his office, and she runs across some information on a little-known case filed against Pacific Gas and Electric. Erin begins digging into the particulars of the case, convinced that the facts simply don't add up, and persuades Ed to allow her to do further research; in time, she discovers a systematic cover-up of the industrial poisoning of a city's water supply, which threatens the health of the entire community. Erin Brockovich was directed by Steven Soderbergh; Julia Roberts earned a $20 million payday for her work on the film, the highest salary paid to a female film star up to that time(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">About a Boy</title>
    <desc lang="en">London's most frequently eligible bachelor gets some lessons in growing up from a maladroit 12-year-old boy in this third big-screen adaptation of a Nick Hornby novel, directed and co-written by siblings Chris and Paul Weitz of American Pie fame. About a Boy concerns the parallel coming-of-age stories of the thirtysomething Will (Hugh Grant), a layabout "serial nice guy" living a posh, carefree lifestyle off his deceased father's fortune; and the preteen Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), a bright but awkward youth who's tired of his mom Fiona's (Toni Collette) depressed, boyfriend-less state. Their paths collide when Will, deciding that single mothers are the easiest romantic conquests on the dating scene, fabricates a two-year-old son and joins a group called S.P.A.T. (Single Parents Alone Together). Marcus is wise to Will's scheme, however, and through some incessant pestering and blackmail, he contrives for Will to date Fiona. Though Will doesn't hit it off immediately with either Marcus or his mother, he gradually begins to open up to the people around him -- so much so that he attracts the attention of another attractive single mom (Rachel Weisz). A U.S./U.K. co-production of Robert DeNiro's Tribeca Films and Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner's Working Title (the company responsible for the Grant-related Four Weddings and a Funeral and Bridget Jones's Diary), About a Boy was co-written by What's Eating Gilbert Grape creator Peter Hedges(n)</desc>

But he's also suffered setbacks in his personal life, from being arrested with a loaded gun at an airport to being accused by his co-star in the TV show Martin of sexual harassment. In this outstanding film of his stand-up routine, he confronts his demons and those who demonise him, as well as veering off to his favourite subject: women, and how hard they are to live with. And 'rundletat' is short for 'run and tell that'(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Julia Roberts stars in this legal drama based on the true story of a woman who helped win the largest settlement ever paid in a direct-action lawsuit. Erin Brockovich (Roberts) is a single mother of three who, after losing a personal injury lawsuit, asks her lawyer, Ed Masry (Albert Finney), if he can help her find a job. Ed gives her work as a file clerk in his office, and she runs across some information on a little-known case filed against Pacific Gas and Electric. Erin begins digging into the particulars of the case, convinced that the facts simply don't add up, and persuades Ed to allow her to do further research; in time, she discovers a systematic cover-up of the industrial poisoning of a city's water supply, which threatens the health of the entire community. Erin Brockovich was directed by Steven Soderbergh; Julia Roberts earned a $20 million payday for her work on the film, the highest salary paid to a female film star up to that time(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A single father who has just found success as the host of an outrageous television talk show begins to question his path in life when he returns home to attend his parents' 50th wedding anniversary party in the company of his famous fiancée -- a reality television star -- in this crisis-of-conscience comedy starring Martin Lawrence. RJ Stevens (Lawrence) is a television talk-show sensation who has transcended his modest Southern beginnings to become the most popular self-help guru ever to grace the small screen. His show, "Team of Me," is a ratings juggernaut, his fiancée is a beautiful reality television star, and his pockets are always lined with large bills. There are few Tinseltown dreams that RJ hasn't already achieved, so when his parents announce their 50th wedding anniversary, the family-oriented television star immediately drops everything and sets his sights on Georgia. As a boy, RJ was always the target of ridicule within his family, but these days things are different; not only does RJ have a ten-year-old son, but his bride-to-be is admired by countless viewers all across the globe on a weekly basis. But RJ's egotistical West Coast attitude simply doesn't fly in the South, and when his lovable but relentless family refuses to cut him any slack due to his current superstar status, he must finally pause and take stock of the man he has become. Louis C.K., Cedric the Entertainer, Michael Clarke Duncan, and James Earl Jones co-star in a Southern-flavored family comedy written and directed by Malcolm D. Lee(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Leatherheads</title>
    <desc lang="en">Good Night, and Good Luck director George Clooney pulls double duty once again in this sports-oriented romantic comedy set against the formation of professional football in the 1920s. Dodge Connelly (Clooney) is a brash and handsome gridiron giant who is equally comfortable leading his team in a barroom brawl or charging for a touchdown in a packed stadium. But when Connelly's team loses their sponsor and the entire league appears set to collapse, the quick-thinking jock attempts a creative late-game comeback. If Connelly can convince former college football star and decorated war hero Carter Rutherford (John Krasinski) to join the team, there may be hope for the ill-fated team after all. Back in World War I, Rutherford single-handedly forced the surrender of multiple German soldiers -- a feat that firmly established the dashing young soldier as America's favorite son. Not only that, but Rutherford's unparalleled speed makes him a valuable asset to the team. To cub reporter Lexie Littleton (Renée Zellweger), Rutherford seems simply too good to be true, and she's determined to prove that her theory is correct. As Littleton digs deep into Rutherford's past, the two teammates enter into a fierce competition for her erratic affections. Now, as Connelly's plan begins to work better than he ever could have anticipated, the rowdy sport he always loved starts to take on a whole new look and feel. In the midst of holding his team together and simultaneously charming the girl of his dreams, Connelly discovers he may be able to use the same strategies he does to win on the field to win in love. Of course, there might be a few fouls as this game enters the fourth quarter, but like every good player, Connelly knows the value of always having a secret play to fall back on before the final score is called(n)</desc>

But then granny has a heart attack, so the kids load her dead body in a trunk and deposit the package on the steps of the local funeral home. The kids are ecstatic thinking that with the big wad of cash Mom has left, they can have a summer of consumer madness. But when they find out that the money has been buried with the baby-sitter, the kids have to fend for themselves to make ends meet. Teen dream Sue Ellen (Christina Applegate) tries working at a fast food restaurant but she can't stand the grease. So, she puts together a false resume and, posing as a twenty-eight-year old, she applies for a job as a receptionist at a garment manufacturing company. The company vice president, Rose is so impressed by her resume that she hires her on the spot as her executive assistant. Her deception looks to be working out great -- Sue Ellen manages to hold off the office lady killer, avoids exposure by the embittered receptionist, borrows money from the company's petty cash box for household incidentals, and continues her relationship with restaurant employee Bryan (Josh Charles). But suddenly, the clothing firm is set to go under, and Sue Ellen must use her teen fashion sense to save the company and her job . . . and she has to get the rest of the brood involved.

    <desc lang="en">Jim Davis' famous cartoon cat finally makes his way to the big screen in this adaptation of the popular comic strip Garfield, which combines live action with CGI animation. Jon Arbuckle (Breckin Meyer) is a sweet, if somewhat clueless, man who shares his home with his pet cat, Garfield (voice of Bill Murray). Garfield is not your ordinary tabby -- he's fat, he's smart-mouthed, he's arrogant, he won't do anything he doesn't have to, and would rather stuff himself with lasagna than do something Jon asks of him. Despite this, Jon loves his cat, but when he decides to expand his animal family, Garfield is less than enthusiastic about the presence of Odie, a lovably enthusiastic dog whose only flaw is his extreme stupidity. While Jon is crazy for Odie, and especially likes having two pets that necessitate periodic visits to Dr. Liz Wilson (Jennifer Love Hewitt), a veterinarian he has a crush on, Garfield decides to remove Odie from the picture. Garfield arranges for Odie to become the property of Happy Chapman (Stephen Tobolowsky), a television host who acts like an animal lover on the round-cornered screen but doesn't much like pets on his own time. While Garfield at first enjoys ruling the roost again, he soon realizes the error of his ways, and in a rare example of selfless and ambitious behavior, hatches a plan to rescue Odie from Chapman. Garfield also features the voice talents of Debra Messing, Brad Garrett, Jimmy Kimmel, and Alan Cumming(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Leatherheads</title>
    <desc lang="en">Good Night, and Good Luck director George Clooney pulls double duty once again in this sports-oriented romantic comedy set against the formation of professional football in the 1920s. Dodge Connelly (Clooney) is a brash and handsome gridiron giant who is equally comfortable leading his team in a barroom brawl or charging for a touchdown in a packed stadium. But when Connelly's team loses their sponsor and the entire league appears set to collapse, the quick-thinking jock attempts a creative late-game comeback. If Connelly can convince former college football star and decorated war hero Carter Rutherford (John Krasinski) to join the team, there may be hope for the ill-fated team after all. Back in World War I, Rutherford single-handedly forced the surrender of multiple German soldiers -- a feat that firmly established the dashing young soldier as America's favorite son. Not only that, but Rutherford's unparalleled speed makes him a valuable asset to the team. To cub reporter Lexie Littleton (Renée Zellweger), Rutherford seems simply too good to be true, and she's determined to prove that her theory is correct. As Littleton digs deep into Rutherford's past, the two teammates enter into a fierce competition for her erratic affections. Now, as Connelly's plan begins to work better than he ever could have anticipated, the rowdy sport he always loved starts to take on a whole new look and feel. In the midst of holding his team together and simultaneously charming the girl of his dreams, Connelly discovers he may be able to use the same strategies he does to win on the field to win in love. Of course, there might be a few fouls as this game enters the fourth quarter, but like every good player, Connelly knows the value of always having a secret play to fall back on before the final score is called(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The 1995 novel by Dr. Gene Brewer becomes this drama from director Iain Softley. After a mugging incident at New York's Grand Central Station, Prot (Kevin Spacey), a man who claims to be an alien from the planet K-PAX, is turned over to a public mental hospital and the care of Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges). When medication fails to alter Prot's insistence that he is visiting from another world on a fact-finding mission, Powell gets more involved with his patient, who seems to have a calming effect on the other residents of his ward. At first convinced that Prot is a delusional who can be treated, Powell begins to wonder if his bizarre patient's story is true, particularly after the hospital's doctors find that Prot possesses the baffling ability to see ultraviolet light. As the date grows nearer when Prot claims he must leave Earth (a "class BA-III planet"), Powell becomes increasingly concerned that a psychiatric breakthrough must occur by then. K-PAX (2001) co-stars Alfre Woodard and Mary McCormack(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Blair Witch Project</title>
    <desc lang="en">Combining Hi-8 video with black-and-white 16 mm film, this film presents a raw look at what can happen when college students forego common sense and enter the world of voodoo and witchcraft. Presented as a straightforward documentary, the film opens with a title card explaining that in 1994, three students went into the Maryland back woods to do a film project on the Blair Witch incidents. These kids were never seen again, and the film you are about to see is from their recovered equipment, found in the woods a year later. The entire movie documents their adventures leading up to their final minutes. The Blair Witch incident, as we initially learn from the local town elders, is an old legend about a group of witches who tortured and killed several children many years ago. Everyone in town knows the story and they're all sketchy on the details. Out in the woods and away from their parked car (and civilization), what starts as a school exercise turns into a nightmare when the three kids lose their map. Forced to spend extra days finding their way out, the kids then start to hear horrific sounds outside their tents in the pitch-black middle of night. They also find strange artifacts from (what can only be) the Blair Witch, still living in the woods. Frightened, they desperately try to find their way out of the woods, with no luck. Slowly these students start to unravel, knowing they have no way of getting out, no food, and it's getting cold. Each night they are confronted with shrieking and sounds so haunting that they are convinced someone is following them, and they quickly begin to fear for their lives. The film premiered in the midnight movie section at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">About a Boy</title>
    <desc lang="en">London's most frequently eligible bachelor gets some lessons in growing up from a maladroit 12-year-old boy in this third big-screen adaptation of a Nick Hornby novel, directed and co-written by siblings Chris and Paul Weitz of American Pie fame. About a Boy concerns the parallel coming-of-age stories of the thirtysomething Will (Hugh Grant), a layabout "serial nice guy" living a posh, carefree lifestyle off his deceased father's fortune; and the preteen Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), a bright but awkward youth who's tired of his mom Fiona's (Toni Collette) depressed, boyfriend-less state. Their paths collide when Will, deciding that single mothers are the easiest romantic conquests on the dating scene, fabricates a two-year-old son and joins a group called S.P.A.T. (Single Parents Alone Together). Marcus is wise to Will's scheme, however, and through some incessant pestering and blackmail, he contrives for Will to date Fiona. Though Will doesn't hit it off immediately with either Marcus or his mother, he gradually begins to open up to the people around him -- so much so that he attracts the attention of another attractive single mom (Rachel Weisz). A U.S./U.K. co-production of Robert DeNiro's Tribeca Films and Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner's Working Title (the company responsible for the Grant-related Four Weddings and a Funeral and Bridget Jones's Diary), About a Boy was co-written by What's Eating Gilbert Grape creator Peter Hedges(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Little Rock Central: 50 Years Later</title>
    <desc lang="en">The events that transpired at Little Rock Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, in September 1957 not only set a key and vital precedent for civil rights in the United States, but permanently altered the sociocultural landscape of postwar America. Late that month, Governor Orval Faubus unsuccessfully attempted to block the entrance of several African American students into the school, only to meet an unstoppable tide of resistance from President Dwight D. Eisenhower and the 101st Airborne Division of the U.S. Army. But what subsequently became of Little Rock Central High? For the 2007 documentary Little Rock High: 50 Years Later, documentarists Brent Renaud and Craig Renaud hearken back to the pivotal institution and commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Little Rock Crisis, by cross sectioning the school's current racial makeup, student attitudes, administration and policies. The filmmakers thus reveal the outstanding social progress eked out by the school, even as they unveil related challenges that still confront students and faculty members(n)</desc>

In this instance, that "underdog" is not some impoverished wretch, but instead the fabulously wealthy Larry Kirkoff (played by a pre-stardom James Woods), heir to a family fortune. Suspected of murdering his parents to get their money, Kirkoff hires Jimbo to prove his innocence, and to nail the guilty party, who may or may not have been the respective ex-lovers of his late mom and dad. Unfortunately, there are some extremely tough characters around and about who'd prefer that Larry remain under suspicion(n)</desc>

This doesn't quite explain why Florence, or Barbara, or whoever has hired Jim--but it does tell more than we want to know about Correll and his sinister motives. Curiously, guest star Joan Van Ark's name is spelled "Van Arc" in the opening credits...a mistake that certainly would not occur in future years(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The story of Alice in Wonderland receives a hyper-violent makeover in Watchmen and 300 director Zack Snyder's fantastical tale of a young psychiatric patient who escapes into a vivid world of fantasy after being committed to a mental hospital by her abusive stepfather. Set in the 1950s, Sucker Punch takes viewers on an incredible journey into the mind of Babydoll (Emily Browning), who finds herself at the mercy of her malevolent stepfather after her mother passes away. With no remaining family and no friends to turn to, her stepfather has her committed to a bleak mental hospital, where she is scheduled to receive a lobotomy in five days. As the procedure draws near, Babydoll creates a phantasmagorical alternate reality in which she must seek out five items in order to secure her freedom. Should she fail, her mind isn't the only thing she stands to lose. Abbie Cornish, Vanessa Hudgens, Carla Gugino, and Jon Hamm co-star in a film co-written by Snyder and Steve Shibuya(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">With attitudes to feminism, foreigners and family values being somewhat different 40 years ago, the second of two programmes narrated by Matt Lucas focuses on `good old-fashioned Britishness' on TV in the 1970s. From blacking-up in popular pre-watershed programmes, through to homophobia and xenophobia, the decade seems to have had a different set of manners and morals, and took a casual approach to sexism and racism. Looking back on a selection of surprising clips are the people who made the shows, those who watched them at the time, and younger viewers providing a fresh perspective.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Predator.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The broadcaster continues his bug-eyed view of the world of creepy-crawlies, revealing how predators defuse the defences of their prey. Highlights include the cockroach wasp, busy preparing a tasty - and very live - treat for its young, the whirligig beetle, which employs a water-based radar system, and the jumping portia spider, which feeds on other arachnids.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Courtship.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">A further selection of creepy-crawly close-ups, focusing on courtship in the bug world. Highlights include scorpions shaking their booty, the perfume-wearing nasonia wasp and the tropical cricket, for whom romance goes out of the window as it uses bribery to seal the deal with would-be partners. One potential partner to steer well clear of, however, is the praying mantis, the female of which is notorious for eating the male just after - or even during - mating. Narrated by David Attenborough.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Reproduction.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">A close-up view of sex, bug-style, as David Attenborough talks viewers through the different ways in which creepy-crawlies reproduce. Size matters for the minuscule male orb spider, creepily sneaking up on its intended and trying to mate without her noticing, while there's no rest for the lothario-like butterfly, which has plenty of notches on its proverbial bedpost. However, the harvestman spider has no use for sex at all, and reproduces by cloning itself.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Open Water 2: Adrift</title>
    <desc lang="en">A seafaring birthday celebration takes a turn for the terrifying when the passengers of a luxury yacht forget to lower the automated ladder before jumping into the ocean for a playful swim. It was a perfect setting for a relaxing weekend at sea, but sometimes even the best-planned trips can take an unexpected turn for the worst. After diving into the ocean and realizing to their horror that they have forgotten to lower the safety ladder, the friends who had set out for a simple weekend getaway realize that they have become helplessly stranded in the middle of the ocean. The sheer sides of the yacht are impossible to climb, and now the group is growing increasingly desperate. As the grim reality of their helpless situation slowly begins to dawn on the doomed friends, hydrophobic Amy (Susan May Pratt) struggles to maintain her composure after realizing that her baby daughter Sarah is helpless and alone aboard the boat. Now treading water as panic begins to set in, the once inseparable friends fast begin to turn on one another as exhaustion begins to set in and the vast ocean threatens to swallow the entire group without a trace(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Hurt Locker</title>
    <desc lang="en">Kathryn Bigelow's compelling fact-based, Iraq-set bomb disposal drama was scripted by journalist Mark Boal, drawing on his experiences while embedded with a United States Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal team in 2004. The focus is on the complex characters making up Bravo Company, who disable and destroy improvised explosive devices. The days are ticking down to the end of the bomb squad's tour, but their role puts the team in harm's way around the clock. And it doesn't help that one of the team is addicted to risk taking and pays scant attention to standard procedure, putting other lives in danger, as well as his own. The Hurt Locker provides a tense glimpse into the lives of these extraordinary men, and also probes the various psychologies of people whose job could kill them at any moment, as well as - briefly - exploring how they cope once away from their adrenaline-soaked vocation(n)</desc>

Shortly after Kathy arrives in Bosnia, Human Rights Commission head Madeleine Rees (Vanessa Redgrave) promotes her to the U.N.'s Gender Office, where she begins studying sexual-assault cases.

    <title lang="en">Revolutionary Road</title>
    <desc lang="en">Drama based on Richard Yates's acclaimed novel, reuniting the Titanic stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. April and Frank Wheeler are a young, thriving couple living with their two children in a Connecticut suburb in the mid-1950s. Their self-assured exterior masks a creeping frustration at their inability to feel fulfilled in their relationships or careers. Frank is mired in a well-paying but boring office job, and April is a housewife still mourning the demise of her hoped-for acting career. Determined to identify themselves as superior to the mediocre sprawl of suburbanites who surround them, they decide to move to France where they will be better able to develop their true artistic sensibilities, free of the consumerist demands of capitalist America. But as their relationship deteriorates into an endless cycle of squabbling, jealousy and recriminations, their trip and their dreams of self-fulfilment are thrown into jeopardy(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Drama based on Richard Yates's acclaimed novel, reuniting the Titanic stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. April and Frank Wheeler are a young, thriving couple living with their two children in a Connecticut suburb in the mid-1950s. Their self-assured exterior masks a creeping frustration at their inability to feel fulfilled in their relationships or careers. Frank is mired in a well-paying but boring office job, and April is a housewife still mourning the demise of her hoped-for acting career. Determined to identify themselves as superior to the mediocre sprawl of suburbanites who surround them, they decide to move to France where they will be better able to develop their true artistic sensibilities, free of the consumerist demands of capitalist America. But as their relationship deteriorates into an endless cycle of squabbling, jealousy and recriminations, their trip and their dreams of self-fulfilment are thrown into jeopardy(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Surfer, Dude</title>
    <desc lang="en">Hands on a Hard Body director S.R. Bindler directs this wave-twisting tale of a soul-searching surfer (Matthew McConaughey) in the midst of an existential crisis. Steve Addington (McConaughey) is an herb-toking long-boarder with a keen sense of balance and a mellow outlook on life. Upon returning to his hometown of Malibu to spend the summer with old friends, Steve begins to sense that the good vibes he remembers as a boy have been hopelessly corrupted by the powers that be. When the earthen surfer is faced with the prospect of expanding into virtual-reality video games and reality television or risk being rendered irrelevant, he opts to keep riding the majestic Southern California waves rather than participate in this new digital reality. Fate seems to intercede, however, when the ocean simply ceases to produce any suitable waves. His finances dried up, his sponsored expense accounts suddenly canceled, and his friends flocking off to bluer pastures, the surfer without a wave suddenly realizes that he has but two choices in life: he can either sit tight and try to keep his sanity until the waves come rolling in again, or finally give in to the Man and his intoxicating world of artificial amusements. Perhaps with a little wisdom from his trusted manager (Woody Harrelson), his aging mentor (Scott Glenn), his guardian angel (Willie Nelson), and his newfound muse (Alexie Gilmore), Addington can somehow manage to maintain his mellow just long enough to put it all into perspective and get back to the basics(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</title>
    <desc lang="en">Terry Gilliam (Brazil, Twelve Monkeys, The Fisher King) directed this colorful, stylized, pseudo-psychedelic $21-million adaptation of the 1971 Hunter S. Thompson classic, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey into the Heart of the American Dream, about stoned sportswriter Raoul Duke, Thompson's alter ego, on a wild drug-crazed road trip, a paranoid plummet into the belly of the beast, with his pal, lawyer Oscar Zeta Acosta. Originally serialized in Rolling Stone (November 1971), the book catapulted Thompson headfirst toward the Kerouac-Mailer-Capote pantheon and jump-started the entire movement of "gonzo journalism." Carrying a suitcase of drugs, Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp with shaved pate) and his attorney Dr. Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro) drive a red convertible across the Mojave from L.A. to Vegas, where Duke has an assignment to cover the Mint 400 desert motorcycle race. As the drugs kick in, Duke ventures into voiceover, filling in the blank spots and narrative gaps. "This is not a good town for psychedelic drugs," says Duke, but even so, they consume vast quantities, eventually escalating to ether. Duke notes that with ether "you can actually watch yourself behaving this terrible way, but you can't control it." The two trash their hotel room, and Gonzo goes back to L.A. Thinking the hotel room holocaust will lead to an arrest, Duke begins a drive back to L.A., but after an odd encounter with a highway patrolman (Gary Busey) and a telephone conversation with Gonzo, he returns to Vegas to cover the District Attorney Convention on Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs in the glitzy Flamingo Hotel. This time the drugged-out duo trash their Flamingo room. The crazed carnival atmosphere segues into a carney casino, Bazooko's Circus, where a barker (Penn Jillette) spiels amid aerialists, clowns, and a rotating carousel bar. Gonzo worries over runaway teen Lucy (Christina Ricci), who paints portraits of Barbra Streisand. Soon the hallucinations begin: Duke sees Gonzo transmogrify into a demon with breasts on its back, and an acid vision of a Vegas bar features large legit lounge lizards (courtesy of monster makeup man Rob Bottin). Flashbacks depicting Duke's intro to the drug scene jump back to love-Haight relationships in San Francisco's Summer of Love. Cameos and guest stars include Mark Harmon, Cameron Diaz, Flea, Lyle Lovett, Harry Dean Stanton, Ellen Barkin, Tobey Maguire, and Hunter S. Thompson himself. The film features a Geffen Records soundtrack mixing rock of the period with Vegas lounge tunes. Over the years, various script adaptations came and went as did numerous talents; people connected with past efforts to film Thompson's book include Martin Scorsese, Jack Nicholson, Dan Aykroyd, John Belushi, and writer-director Alex Cox. Shown in competition at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Raven</title>
    <desc lang="en">Upon discovering that a psychotic serial killer has been using his writings as inspiration, legendary author Edgar Allan Poe (John Cusack) joins forces with a bright, young Baltimore detective to catch the maniac and end his reign of terror. Detective Emmett Fields (Luke Evans) was investigating a vicious murder when he realized the crime scene bore a striking resemblance to a mystery story that was just published in the local newspaper. The author of that ominous tale was Edgar Allan Poe, a brilliant young writer whose status as a social outcast catches the attention of the diligent detective. Shortly after Poe is questioned by the authorities, detectives stumble upon yet another murder scene that seems to have been inspired by the author's morbid writings. Convinced that the killer will once again use Poe's writings as a springboard to murder, Detective Fields recruits the reclusive author to help piece together a pattern to the crimes and stop the madman before he can strike again. Brendan Gleeson and Alice Eve co-star in this tense period thriller from director James McTeigue (V for Vendetta)(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Man Who Wasn't There</title>
    <desc lang="en">Shot in black-and-white and set in small-town California in the late '40s, this latest film from Joel Coen and brother Ethan Coen is a throwback to vintage film noir. Recalling Alfred Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt in its setting of Santa Rosa, CA, the story follows the dutiful, passive barber Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton), who narrates the tale. A soft-spoken fellow, Ed is greeted by Creighton Tolliver (played by Coen regular Jon Polito), a chatterbox customer who tells Ed that dry cleaning is the wave of the future. When Ed discovers his wife Doris (Frances McDormand) has been cheating on him with her department store boss Big Dave (James Gandolfini), Ed suddenly turns bitterly jealous. He hatches a blackmail scheme to extort money from Big Dave to fund a dry cleaning enterprise, which takes a wrong turn when Big Dave ends up dead. Meanwhile, Doris is charged with Dave's murder, having been found doctoring the books at her job, and Ed hires an impeccable new lawyer (Tony Shalhoub), who proves costly in the midst of his already unraveling life. The film also co-stars Michael Badalucco, Katherine Borowitz, and Scarlet Johanssen(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Walking Dead</title>
    <desc lang="en">Using relatively unknown actors, first-time screenwriter-director Preston A. Whitmore II examines the effects of the Vietnam War on four black Marines sent on a doomed prisoner-of-war rescue mission. The four men are what's left of a platoon that's been decimated after landing behind enemy lines. In charge is Sergeant Barkley (Joe Morton), a no-nonsense, Bible-quoting preacher who is leading three privates to find a POW camp in an abandoned temple. Cole Evans (Allen Payne) is an intellectual who is highly political, racially proud, and a devoted family man. Joe Brooks (Vonte Sweet) is a cheerful, naïve, and brave young soldier. Hoover Branche (Eddie Griffin) is a dope-smoking, foul-mouthed rebel who hates the war and fights the sergeant constantly. They eventually are joined by a crazy, bloodthirsty white soldier, Pippins (Roger Floyd). Flashbacks reveal why each character joined the Marines. Pippins entered the recruiting office to escape rival gang members who were trying to kill him. Brooks enlisted to impress his girlfriend. Branche signed up after being fired from a meat-packing plant for stealing a ham that he used as admission to a party where he wanted to woo a girl. Evans enlisted because bigoted real estate agents prevented him from buying a decent home for his family in L.A. -- he intended to become a Marine officer so that he can get free housing(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Back There</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Back There. After speculating on the possibility that a person can travel back in time and change history, Peter Corrigan (Russell Johnson) bids farewell to his friends and prepares to head home from his club. As he walks through the doors, he is unexpectedly transported from 1961 to 1865. Once he gets his bearings, Corrigan finds himself in a position to prevent the assassination of Abraham Lincoln -- but this "wrinkle in time" turns out to have entirely different results. Scripted by Rod Serling, "Back There" is one of the lesser offerings of Twilight Zone's 1960-61 season, though it does boast an excellent musical score by Jerry Goldsmith, which would remain in the standard TV stock-music repertoire throughout the 1960s and 1970s. The episode first aired January 13, 1961(n)</desc>

The punchline of this episode will be amusing only to those who lived through the darkest days of the Cold War (though a passing reference to "Jack Kennedy" has been excised from most existing prints). Future Laugh-In regular Arte Johnson appears as Hunnicutt's long-suffering assistant.

Paul Walker stars as Lewis Thomas, a college freshman embarking on a cross-country road trip during summer break to pick up his girlfriend Venna (Leelee Sobieski). Along for the ride is Lewis' brother Fuller (Steve Zahn), a practical joker who uses the car's CB radio to play a cruel prank on a lonely trucker known only by the handle Rusty Nail. The victim of Fuller's gag turns out to be a psychotic murderer and soon the brothers are being pursued by the relentless stalker, who gets his revenge in gruesome fashion.

    <desc lang="en">Mike Mignola's acclaimed comic book series about a creature from Hades who joins the battle against evil arrives on the screen in vivid form in this adaptation directed by distinctive horror filmmaker Guillermo del Toro. During World War II, the Third Reich has joined forces with the evil Grigori Rasputin (Karel Roden), who has used his occult powers to summon up a young demon from the depth of Hell to be used as the ultimate Axis weapon. However, the demonic creature is captured by American forces, and put in the care of Professor Broom (John Hurt), the founder of a top-secret organization called the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense. Under Broom's tutelage, the creature develops empathy and a desire to do good while his physical powers and paranormal talents are honed to a fine point. Sixty years later, the demon, now known as Hellboy (Ron Perlman), is part of an elite secret defense team alongside Liz Sherman (Selma Blair), a beautiful young woman who can create fire with her mind, and Abe Sapian (Doug Jones), an aquatic humanoid with the power of telepathy. Despite his many years of fighting for right, Hellboy finds himself facing his greatest challenge when the powerful Rasputin returns, determined to bring the demon back to the forces of darkness so that evil may finally rule the world. Hellboy's supporting cast also includes Jeffrey Tambor, Rupert Evans, and Brian Steele(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The origins of the Caped Crusader of Gotham City are finally brought to the big screen in this new adaptation of the perennially popular comic-book series. As a child, Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) lived a comfortable life as the son of wealthy parents, but the realities of life in crime-ridden Gotham City were brought home to him when his mother and father were murdered. Wayne pledged to bring justice and order back to the city and avenge the death of his parents, and one day he is approached by Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), a teacher who guides him in the study of martial arts and the ways in which an ordinary man can become a champion. With the help of Ducard and gadget master Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), Wayne develops a secret identity as Batman, a masked fighter for justice who is determined to bring peace and safety back to Gotham. Batman Begins also features Michael Caine as faithful manservant Alfred Pennyworth, Gary Oldman as Lt. James Gordon, Katie Holmes as Wayne's sweetheart, Rachel Dawes, and Cillian Murphy as the villainous Scarecrow(n)</desc>
