    <desc lang="en">Documentary catching up with London's Crossrail engineers less than two years after the project's excavations uncovered the 14th-century Charterhouse plague pit. In an extraordinary turn of events, further work on the Liverpool Street station has revealed another burial ground, this time accommodating the capital's radicals, rebels and outsiders. The Bedlam burial ground, which is thought to be the final resting place of nearly 20,000 people, was believed to be lost for around 300 years. Now, with the excavation process under way, archaeologists and historians have been using bone analysis techniques in conjunction with parish records to reveal the names and life stories of those whose remains were found on-site. Their research reveals that people came from as far afield as Africa to work in the English capital, and sheds light on how pollution first became one of the city's most prolific killers.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Hollywood Ending</title>
    <desc lang="en">A down-on-his luck auteur gets one more chance at the big time -- provided his neuroses don't swallow him whole -- in Woody Allen's 33rd feature release, Hollywood Ending. Allen plays Val Waxman, a one-time cinematic genius who's resorted to taking advertisement work to pay the bills for himself and his airhead live-in girlfriend, Lori (Debra Messing). Val finds his luck is about to change, however, when he receives the script for The City Never Sleeps , a period noir set against the backdrop of 1940s New York City. It seems his ex-wife, Ellie (Tea Leoni), now an executive at Galaxy Pictures, has been pulling for him to direct the picture, claiming he's the only man who can do justice to the script. She even manages to convince her boyfriend, Hal (Treat Williams), Galaxy's high-powered studio head, to take a chance on Val's "unique vision." Just when the cameras are ready to roll, however, Val finds that unique vision in jeopardy -- literally -- as he's struck with a psychosomatic case of blindness. When physicians and psychiatrists fail to cure him, Val contrives a scheme to forge ahead with the picture, for fear of blowing his one last chance at greatness. Hollywood Ending co-stars George Hamilton and Mark Rydell(n)</desc>

Unfortunately, tradition demands that Rory be "presented" by her father Christopher (David Sutcliffe) -- who of course ran out on the girl and her unwed mother, Lorelai (Lauren Graham), years earlier. When asked to escort Rory, the customarily dishevelled and unreliable Christopher not only accepts the invitation but also arrives in a clean new suit announcing that he has taken a good, respectable job. As it turns out, these are not the only surprises that Christopher has in store for Lorelai and her family -- nor is Richard any slouch in the "surprise" department himself(n)</desc>

The most noteworthy change from the original version was the absence of Regis Philbin's familiar catchphrases: One would never hear Meredith Vieira chime in with the legendary "Is that your final answer?"

The syndicated Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? was launched on September 16, 2002(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Rooster Cogburn</title>
    <desc lang="en">(1975) John Wayne reprises his role as Federal Marshal 'Rooster' Cogburn, for which he won his sole Oscar in True Grit, six years earlier. This time out, the rambunctious, one-eyed lawman finds himself in pursuit of a gang of outlaws who've made off with a consignment of nitro-glycerine. As they flee, the violent criminals stumble across a village in Indian Territory, where they rape the women and murder most of the inhabitants. Bible-bashing spinster Eula Goodnight (Katharine Hepburn) survives the massacre and insists on Cogburn taking her along to avenge her father's killing. Despite the grim start to the adventure, Stuart Miller's light-hearted Western is shot through with humour and is especially noted for the sparky exchanges between the two lead stars.

    <title lang="en">Kiss the Girls</title>
    <desc lang="en">Washington, D.C.-based police forensic psychologist Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman) has impartially investigated numerous gruesome and difficult cases, but when he learns that his niece Naomi (Gina Ravera) has been kidnapped and may be in the clutches of a serial killer, matters become personal. To add his expertise, Alex heads to Durham, North Carolina and arrives about the time that a pair of local cops (Cary Elwes and Alex McArthur) discover two dead and sexually brutalized women tied to trees. The killer signed his work "Cassanova." Alex soon learns that eight women, all of them intelligent, strong-willed and beautiful have been similarly abducted. He gains further insight when Alex encounters Dr. Kate McTiernan (Ashley Judd), a woman who was also abducted by the killer but managed to escape bondage. It is she who confirms Alex's growing suspicion that the kidnapper is more interested in collecting and subduing these women than killing them. Matters become more complicated when a copy-cat killer turns up. This intelligent thriller is very close in style and execution to Seven (1997)(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Only four bakers remain as the semi-final arrives. This week, the contestants must demonstrate their mastery of patisserie in three more challenges. However, the stakes have never been higher, and a disaster in any one of the rounds might mean the difference between claiming a place in the final, or bowing out early. In the Signature, the bakers must achieve perfect lamination on French pastries, and in the Technical, Paul Hollywood puts the amateurs through their paces with a yeast-based cake with a fruity top and delicate chocolate work. For the Showstopper finale, the competitors face a multiple mini-cake bake, with Paul and fellow judge Mary Berry expecting a high-end finish that demonstrates the bakers' ability to manage their time.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Who's Spending Britain's Billions</title>
    <desc lang="en">Jacques Peretti looks beyond the well-known budgets of schools, hospitals and foreign aid to the range of taxation projects the public know less about. Peretti finds that local councils across the UK are signing contracts with management consultancy firms who can take a percentage of any savings they find. He also reveals that hundreds of the millions of taxpayers' pounds spent on these contracts are covered by confidential deals, meaning very little detail is known about them. In this revealing insight, Peretti asks if the public deserves to know more about how those charged with managing the nation's billions are spending it.(n)</desc>

On his journey from the Latvian capital Riga to Tampere in Finland, he encounters medieval knights in Tallinn, grills sausages in Helsinki and samples cloudberry liqueur in a hot tub.

The candidates soon get creative, with each team splitting up to film the adverts and work on the rest of the campaigns - which is usually a sure sign of poor communication somewhere along the way. Sure enough, things soon begin to fall apart at the seams, and to make matters worse, the pitches to industry experts also threaten to be derailed by nerves and confusion.

    <sub-title lang="en">World in Motion.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The historian concludes his review by looking at the last few years of the decade and a society transformed by accelerated change. Not only did the late 1980s see the rise of the yuppie and the economic big bang in the City of London, but shopping habits changed with the growing popularity of German cars, French wine, Italian fashion and Scandinavian interior design. Alongside this transformation was a growing disconnection from the political elite, signified by the growing rave culture and the community charge riots. For Margaret Thatcher, widely seen as the architect of much of this change, things would not end well. Last in the series.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Neil Oliver and Tessa Dunlop continue their comprehensive guide to Britain's coastline, this time turning attention to the North Sea coast, a stretch that takes in two nations, and is bordered by a pair of huge estuaries, the Forth in Scotland, and the Humber in England. Neil sheds light on a military shipbuilding project in Rosyth, and heads to the island of Inchmickery to investigate a bird colony with a difference. From there, he tells a tragic story that still haunts the fishing village of Eyemouth, and then visits the holy island of Lindisfarne to make a dramatic archeological discovery.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">No Place to Call Home</title>
    <desc lang="en">Documentary shedding light on the work of housing officers working in the London borough of Barking and Dagenham, where a shortage of affordable homes, rising rent prices and a lack of available council housing have all contributed to an increase in the number of people facing homelessness. Drawing comparisons to the 1966 television play Cathy Come Home, which depicted a young couple's descent into poverty and homelessness, the programme explains how problems first encountered 50 years ago are resurfacing. Recorded over the course of nine months, the film details how a new generation of would-be residents are looking in vain for a place to call their own.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Dominic Sandbrook explores the rise of the individual in post-war culture.

The concept of individual identity and self-determination reached fruition after the war, and saw the emergence of those such as John Lennon, John Self, Kate Bush, and the seemingly endless stream of TV talent show contestants.

    <desc lang="en">First of a two-part documentary exploring the history of the prison and the crimes of its most notorious inmates, as well as uncovering scandals hidden within its walls. The facility was built in 1852 and initially housed both male and female prisoners. However, in 1902 it became a female-only jail and had a new gallows installed, with its first victims being serial baby killers Amelia Sach and Annie Walters. Suffragettes imprisoned there were treated as common criminals and when some of them began hunger strikes, the regime's response was brutal. The programme ends by taking a look at the prison during the Second World War and up to 1948.(n)</desc>

Agustin Rejas (Javier Bardem) is a former lawyer who became a police detective as a more direct way of dealing with crime and justice. Rejas has been assigned to investigate a group of terrorists who are determined to up-end the current government through any means necessary, from revolting pranks (such as leaving dead animals, painted with revolutionary rhetoric, around the capitol building) to bombings and assassinations. Rejas knows little about the terrorists, and no one on the force is certain of the identity or whereabouts of the group's leader, who calls himself President Ezequiel. As Rejas learns more about Ezequiel and his group, they begin stepping up their actions, making his investigation all the more urgent. Meanwhile, Rejas is a man whose daughter is taking dance lessons from Yolanda (Laura Morante); as Rejas and Yolanda get to know one another, a romance begins to grow between them, but in time, Rejas begins to suspect that the woman he loves is working with the terrorists he's been trying to ferret out(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Dancer Upstairs</title>
    <desc lang="en">Actor John Malkovich made his directorial debut with this tense political thriller, set in an unnamed Latin American nation and based on a novel by Nicholas Shakespeare. Agustin Rejas (Javier Bardem) is a former lawyer who became a police detective as a more direct way of dealing with crime and justice. Rejas has been assigned to investigate a group of terrorists who are determined to up-end the current government through any means necessary, from revolting pranks (such as leaving dead animals, painted with revolutionary rhetoric, around the capitol building) to bombings and assassinations. Rejas knows little about the terrorists, and no one on the force is certain of the identity or whereabouts of the group's leader, who calls himself President Ezequiel. As Rejas learns more about Ezequiel and his group, they begin stepping up their actions, making his investigation all the more urgent. Meanwhile, Rejas is a man whose daughter is taking dance lessons from Yolanda (Laura Morante); as Rejas and Yolanda get to know one another, a romance begins to grow between them, but in time, Rejas begins to suspect that the woman he loves is working with the terrorists he's been trying to ferret out(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Bernie Fineman and Mario Pacione return to seek out more classics in need of restoration, beginning with a Porsche 928 that has suffered from years of water damage.

Once Bernie and his team of mechanics have serviced the engine, the car is taken to a rolling road to put it through its paces, before former racing driver Paul O'Neill assesses its value to see if all the work has been worthwhile.(n)</desc>

Bernie Fineman immediately puts Mario Pacione's nose out of joint by spending £1,500 on a bright orange wreck that will not even start and makes matters worse by laying out another £2,000 behind his back to coax an extra six brake horsepower out of the 500cc engine. Former racing driver Paul O'Neill judges their efforts and decides whether Bernie's improvements make the difference between a profit and a loss. Plus, the car's history is charted through archive footage, revealing what inspired the designers and why their creation was such a success.(n)</desc>

In the first episode he looks at how 19th-century amateur geologist George Bissell went searching for oily puddles in Pennsylvania that he had a hunch could be the source of a new kind of fuel, and follows the story on through the development of products that could light homes, and in turn provide power for the newly emerging mass car market.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Director Robert Luketic adapts Ben Mezrich's best-seller Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions to tell the true-life tale of six genius students who used their brains to beat considerable odds. Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) may be shy, but his wallflower reputation betrays his inner brilliance. As smart as Ben may be, however, if he can't pay his tuition he'll be kicked out of M.I.T. Fortunately, the answer to all of Ben's problems is right there in the cards. Recruited to join a team of extremely gifted students who have used their mastery of numbers to beat the odds at blackjack, Ben procures a fake identity in order to join the casino scammers and their brilliant leader -- eccentric math professor and stats genius Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey) -- in some highly profitable weekend excursions to Las Vegas. Counting cards isn't illegal, and by using a complex series of signals, this team has cracked the code. Of course, it doesn't take long for Ben to become seduced by the glamorous Las Vegas lifestyle, and the attention afforded to him by his sexy teammate Jill Taylor (Kate Bosworth) finds him pushing his luck to the absolute limits. Laurence Fishburne stars as Cole Williams, the Sin City security chief who catches on to the group and makes it his mission to expose their lucrative blackjack scam(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A town called Redemption in the old west isn't big enough for two hot-shot gunslingers, so mad John Herod calls in all the crack shots from miles around to enter a deadly knockout tournament for a mouth-watering prize. He seems keen to eliminate preacherman Cort but female gunslinger Ellen saves his life. As the contest progresses and the rising bodycount embraces all the dispensable characters - including Herod's cocky son - the reasons for the enmity between Herod and Cort and between Herod and Ellen become apparent(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Director Robert Luketic adapts Ben Mezrich's best-seller Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions to tell the true-life tale of six genius students who used their brains to beat considerable odds. Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) may be shy, but his wallflower reputation betrays his inner brilliance. As smart as Ben may be, however, if he can't pay his tuition he'll be kicked out of M.I.T. Fortunately, the answer to all of Ben's problems is right there in the cards. Recruited to join a team of extremely gifted students who have used their mastery of numbers to beat the odds at blackjack, Ben procures a fake identity in order to join the casino scammers and their brilliant leader -- eccentric math professor and stats genius Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey) -- in some highly profitable weekend excursions to Las Vegas. Counting cards isn't illegal, and by using a complex series of signals, this team has cracked the code. Of course, it doesn't take long for Ben to become seduced by the glamorous Las Vegas lifestyle, and the attention afforded to him by his sexy teammate Jill Taylor (Kate Bosworth) finds him pushing his luck to the absolute limits. Laurence Fishburne stars as Cole Williams, the Sin City security chief who catches on to the group and makes it his mission to expose their lucrative blackjack scam(n)</desc>

Alas, in the years since the sixties, Woods has become a disillusioned, dope-smoking ambulance chaser. Goaded by Downey, Woods takes up one last "lost cause:" that of Korean-American prison inmate Yuji Okomoto, who is about to be tried for the self-defense slaying of another prisoner. As Woods investigates, he unearths several iniquities in the trial that sent Okomoto to prison. Despite the fact that the one witness who might clear Okomoto is an unhinged conspiracy theorist, Woods endeavors to re-open Okomoto's case--which plays right into the hands of sharkish, politically ambitious DA Kurtwood Smith. Chock full of plot twists and last-minute shockers, True Believer was popular enough to inspire a spin-off TV series, Eddie Dodd(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Liam Neeson reunites with Unknown director Jaume Collet-Serra) for this airborne thriller about an Air Marshal racing to stop the villain who has framed him as a hijacker during a non-stop flight from New York to London. From the moment we first meet Air Marshal Bill Marks (Neeson), it's apparent his nerves are frayed. After furtively knocking back a stiff drink in the airport parking lot, he enters the crowded terminal to board a plane bound for London. Carefully observing his fellow travelers along the way, Marks eventually ends up seated next to nervous flyer Jen (Julianne Moore), who begins to breathe easier once she's seated near a window. Later, as the plane hits cruising altitude, Marks receives a mysterious text message stating that a passenger on the flight will be killed every 20 minutes unless $150 million is deposited into a secure bank account. But the harder Marks works to identify a suspect, the deeper he implicates himself in what becomes a deadly hostage crisis unfolding at 30,000 feet over the Atlantic Ocean. When it's revealed that the account for the ransom money is in Marks' name, the FAA revokes his marshal status and the media paints him as a hijacker. As the frightened passengers begin to turn on Marks, he suspects the true culprit may not even be on the plane. And with the help of Jen and perceptive airline hostess Nancy (Michelle Dockery), he attempts to clear his name and protect the passengers by any means possible(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Brad Pitt stars as an ex-United Nations employee racing around the globe in a bid to halt a worldwide zombie pandemic in Marc Forster's sprawling adaptation of Max Brooks' bestselling novel of the same name. Retired U.N. investigator Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) and his family are sitting in what appears to be a typical Philadelphia traffic jam when helicopters began to circle ominously overhead, and an explosion throws the city into panic. In the blink of an eye, the streets are consumed by chaos. When Gerry learns that the catalyst for the turmoil is a highly contagious virus that transforms those who contract it into rampaging maniacs, and that legions of the infected are growing on all continents, he agrees to join his former colleagues in discovering the source of the rampant plague so that his wife and two daughters will be guaranteed safety aboard a UN fleet in the Atlantic Ocean. Upon tracing a crucial e-mail to a U.S. military base in South Korea, Gerry learns that the infection has spread more rapidly than anyone realizes. Although a subsequent trip to Jerusalem, where the government has constructed a massive wall to keep the public safe, initially offers hope that the growing horde can be kept at bay, an unexpected breach sends Gerry back into the sky in search of patient zero. Just when Gerry thinks he's traced the origins of the virus, however, the unthinkable happens. Subsequently stranded in Cardiff with a fearless Israeli soldier, Gerry quickly makes his way to a World Health Organization outpost where the few remaining scientists have hit a dead end in their search for a cure. But the struggle is far from over, and after recalling an unusual scene witnessed in Jerusalem, Gerry prepares to make a leap of faith that could prevent the downfall of humanity(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">After seven weeks of competition, only three chefs remain and their last challenge is to prepare a three-course menu for Marcus Wareing, Monica Galetti and Gregg Wallace. They have just 180 minutes to draw on everything they have learnt during the contest and over the course of their careers to create a starter, a main and a dessert that show off their culinary ability. The judges then assess their efforts before deciding who will be crowned champion, succeeding last year's winner Steven Edwards.(n)</desc>

There was a time when the mere mention of the name Randy Daytona (Dan Fogler) was enough to make even those most hardened ping pong player cower in fear, but these days Randy has fallen out of favor with ping-pong fans. The former champ soon receives a much-needed shot at redemption, however, when he is recruited by a determined FBI agent named Rodriguez (George Lopez) to win a coveted spot in the upcoming underground table tennis tournament and ferret out the nefarious Feng (Christopher Walken), whose thriving criminal empire has transformed him into a true menace to society(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Rushmore</title>
    <desc lang="en">After the highly acclaimed independent film Bottle Rocket, director Wes Anderson followed up with a quirky Touchstone Studios film entitled Rushmore. Written by Anderson and friend Owen Wilson (an actor in Armageddon and Anaconda), they created the story of Max Fischer, a highly eccentric 15-year-old boy who attends the tenth grade at Rushmore Academy. Played by Jason Schwartzman (Talia Shire's son and Francis Ford Coppola's nephew), Max is a poor student with big dreams and a love of extracurricular activities. Max is editor of the school newspaper and yearbook, president of the chess, astronomy, French, and German clubs, captain of the fencing team, and director of the school play. Max is also a compulsive liar, telling everyone that his barber father (Seymour Cassel) is really a brain surgeon. Suddenly Max falls in love with Miss Cross (Olivia Williams), a first-grade teacher at the school. He also makes a new friend in business tycoon Mr. Blume (Bill Murray), an eccentric millionaire who also loves Miss Cross. The love triangle heats up as Max refuses to believe that his age has anything to do with Miss Cross refusing his romantic advances. Also Max's scheme to erect an aquarium on the school baseball diamond gets him booted out of Rushmore Academy. As his life crumbles around him, he is forced to grow up and accept the consequences of his actions and his lies. He throws himself more into his extracurricular activities, hoping to redeem himself by staging the most ambitious school play ever attempted(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Racing Stripes</title>
    <desc lang="en">A horse of a different pattern becomes a spoiler in a high-stakes race in the family-friendly comedy-drama. Nolan Walsh (Bruce Greenwood) is a farmer who once earned his living training racehorses before his wife was killed in an accident while riding, which led him to leave the racing game. Nolan tends to his farm and looks after his daughter Channing (Hayden Panettiere) and a large flock of animals, who speak to one another but not to humans. After a traveling circus passes through town, a zebra pony is left behind; Nolan takes in the animal, intending to return it to the circus, but at Channing's insistence they keep the zebra, naming him Stripes (voiced by Frankie Muniz). Channing loves Stripes, and the zebra is welcomed by the other critters on the farm, including grumpy Shetland pony Tucker (voiced by Dustin Hoffman), slow-moving hound dog Lightning (voiced by Snoop Dogg), a New Jersey-born pelican named Goose (voiced by Joe Pantoliano), skinny-brained rooster Reggie (voiced by Jeff Foxworthy), and deep-thinking goat Franny (voiced by Whoopi Goldberg). Channing discovers that Stripes can outrun nearly any horse around, and Woodzie (M. Emmett Walsh), a local character who has spent years handicapping the ponies, is convinced the zebra would be shoo-in in the Kentucky Open, a prestigious race held at the estate of champion horse breeder Clara Dalrymple (Wendie Malick). Channing believes Stripes can win, but he'll need the help of Nolan, who isn't so sure he's ready to start training again; meanwhile, Stripes gets plenty of advice from the other farm animals about his big step onto the race track. Mandy Moore, David Spade, and Steve Harvey also contribute their voice talents to the picture(n)</desc>

The remarkable similarity between humans and chimpanzees is apparent from the opening of the film in the lush forest on the shores of Lake Tanganyika. Here the chimpanzees live -- much like humans -- in family units, make tools, and express complex emotions. Love, jealousy, friendship, and war are all presented, and further blur the distinctions between human and animal. In contrast, the film reveals the shocking conditions under which chimps suffer in research labs. Produced for HBO, Chimps is informative and beautiful, while also being quite strong in its conviction that chimpanzees deserve to live freely in their natural habitat(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Independence Day</title>
    <desc lang="en">(1996) Roland Emmerich's landmark science-fiction blockbuster. Aliens reach Earth and they're clearly hostile: their plan is to suck the planet dry of all its resources, leave behind a burnt cinder circling the sun, and move on. Planting giant ships above the world's major cities, they unleash destruction on an unprecedented scale (superbly realised by the special effects). All attempts to fight back are met by hordes of fighter craft until pilot Steven Hiller (Will Smith) manages to down one and capture its pilot. Meanwhile, scientist David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), having worked out the aliens' purpose, finds a way to destroy them, but he and Hiller need a spacecraft to execute their plan, which brings them to a secret base near Las Vegas... The child of countless science-fiction movies, Independence Day is all-out rollicking, fast-moving action. Edited for language(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">After the successful The Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal, Anthony Hopkins once again plays the perverse, cunning killer Hannibal Lecter in this prequel based on the homonymous book by Thomas Harris. Will Graham (Edward Norton) is an FBI investigator, an expert in analizing the minds and procedures of serial killers. After the dangerous arrest of Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins), Graham decides to end his career as a federal agent to retire and rest in Florida with his wife Molly (Mary-Louise Parker) and their son. However, the sudden appearance of a sadistic murderer known as Tooth Fairy (Ralph Fiennes), leads the investigator to be summoned again by his mentor, Jack Crawford (Harvey Keitel) to catch the criminal. Due to the extreme complexity of the case, Graham goes to Lecter himself for help. Trusting this sinister murderer does not seem to be quite the right thing to do, determined as he is to toy with the fate of the agent and his family. Emily Watson rounds off the multi-star cast of this distressing psychological thriller directed by Brett Ratner, who masterfully applied the exact doses of suspense and horror to the story(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">When deadly meteorites start striking the calm, peaceful community of Berkeley, Australia, a ragtag group of strangers fight for their lives against a hoard of red-blooded zombies that have mysteriously infected the residents. Headed by the town's ex-beauty queen Rene (Felicity Mason) and the village kook, Marion (Mungo McKay), the clan of survivors battle their way through farmhouses, bomb shelters, and back roads until they are faced with a much bigger problem than just the gut-munchers on their trail. The debut feature of writer/directors Michael and Peter Spierig, the film was two and a half years in the making, echoing other no-budget splatter epics like Peter Jackson's Bad Taste and other similarly themed sci-fi horror romps. It went on to garner accolades from the Melbourne International Film Festival and the Catalonian International Film Festival, Sitges, Spain, among others(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Wild West. The American West conjures images of wide-open spaces, endless blue skies, and the wildest creatures in North America. Such iconic animals as pumas, bison, rattlesnakes and eagles are central to the image of America - they put the wild into the Wild West! But as humans have settled the land, these animals have retreated. Have they been penned in and diminished by pollution and habitat loss to the point where they're not the iconic beasts they were? Or are they really still wild? Brady takes a road trip across the Great Plains and majestic mountains. Getting close to these wild animals isn't going to be easy, so he'll head out with scientists to net golden eagles, collar a puma, hunt for rattlers and even test first hand the power of a stampeding bison. At the end of each of these close encounters, Brady will take everything he knows about these animals and rate them on three factors - weaponry, danger to humans, and how much they symbolize the Wild West to determine which is the wildest creature in the West!(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">As World War I rages in Europe and Allied forces in France, Italy, and England find their resolve quickly diminishing due to the overwhelming force of the German juggernaut, a handful of brave American soldiers volunteer to join their French counterparts in learning to fly and fighting for freedom from above as the true story of the legendary Lafayette Escadrille comes to the screen in a breathtaking war adventure from Academy Award-winning director Tony Bill and famed producer Dean Devlin. They have come from all over the United States, ready and willing to put their lives on the line despite their country's initial pledge to not get involved with the all-consuming war that rages throughout Europe. Few could have foreseen the challenges faced by the world's first fighter pilots, however, and upon arriving at their aerodrome in France, the aspiring aviators are assigned to a new squadron under the command of war-ravaged Captain Thenault (Jean Reno) and battle-weary American pilot Reed Cassidy -- the sole survivor of his devastated former air brigade. With little encouragement from their fellow aviators and nothing to drive but their unifying goal of taking to the skies and offering up their lives in the name of freedom, the determined airmen of the Lafayette Escadrille set out to make history by embarking on the adventure of a lifetime. James Franco, Martin Henderson, and David Ellison star in a script penned by Phil Sears, Blake T. Evans, and David S. Ward(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A down-on-his-luck illusionist befriends a pretty admirer, and finds that his constant quest to impress her may be his ultimate downfall in this animated fable based on an original screenplay by Jacques Tati and directed by Sylvain Chomet. Now that the theaters and large performance venues have been taken over by rock bands and pop singers, the illusionist has been forced to ply his trade at small gatherings in bars, cafés, and basements in order earn a living. One day, while performing in a small Scottish pub located on a remote island that has only recently been wired for electricity, the illusionist encounters a young girl named Alice, who is captivated by his otherworldly abilities. Alice believes that the downtrodden performer possesses genuine supernatural powers, and agrees to accompany him on a trip to Edinburgh, where he's scheduled to perform at a modest, out-of-the-way theater. Her affection and enthusiasm inspire the illusionist, who in turn uses his talent to lavish her with a series of extravagant gifts. Unable to muster the courage to tell his starry-eyed admirer the truth about his trade, the illusionist continues giving until he's got nothing more to offer. This picture marked Chomet's first following the 2003 arthouse smash The Triplets of Belleville(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">As World War I rages in Europe and Allied forces in France, Italy, and England find their resolve quickly diminishing due to the overwhelming force of the German juggernaut, a handful of brave American soldiers volunteer to join their French counterparts in learning to fly and fighting for freedom from above as the true story of the legendary Lafayette Escadrille comes to the screen in a breathtaking war adventure from Academy Award-winning director Tony Bill and famed producer Dean Devlin. They have come from all over the United States, ready and willing to put their lives on the line despite their country's initial pledge to not get involved with the all-consuming war that rages throughout Europe. Few could have foreseen the challenges faced by the world's first fighter pilots, however, and upon arriving at their aerodrome in France, the aspiring aviators are assigned to a new squadron under the command of war-ravaged Captain Thenault (Jean Reno) and battle-weary American pilot Reed Cassidy -- the sole survivor of his devastated former air brigade. With little encouragement from their fellow aviators and nothing to drive but their unifying goal of taking to the skies and offering up their lives in the name of freedom, the determined airmen of the Lafayette Escadrille set out to make history by embarking on the adventure of a lifetime. James Franco, Martin Henderson, and David Ellison star in a script penned by Phil Sears, Blake T. Evans, and David S. Ward(n)</desc>

Now that the theaters and large performance venues have been taken over by rock bands and pop singers, the illusionist has been forced to ply his trade at small gatherings in bars, cafés, and basements in order earn a living. One day, while performing in a small Scottish pub located on a remote island that has only recently been wired for electricity, the illusionist encounters a young girl named Alice, who is captivated by his otherworldly abilities. Alice believes that the downtrodden performer possesses genuine supernatural powers, and agrees to accompany him on a trip to Edinburgh, where he's scheduled to perform at a modest, out-of-the-way theater. Her affection and enthusiasm inspire the illusionist, who in turn uses his talent to lavish her with a series of extravagant gifts. Unable to muster the courage to tell his starry-eyed admirer the truth about his trade, the illusionist continues giving until he's got nothing more to offer.

    <desc lang="en">Adrenaline-loving director Tony Scott teams with iconic action producer Jerry Bruckheimer for this high-flung sci-fi action thriller concerning a New Orleans-based maverick ATF agent named Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington) who is brought in on a top-secret government program to catch the terrorist (Jim Caviezel) responsible for a ferry bombing that kills hundreds. Able to do what most law enforcement officers only dream of, Carlin is now able to look back in time at the perpetrator's movements, and at the life of the innocent woman whose death would set the events into motion. Carlin's instincts tell him that something is amiss, however, and while the government agent who tapped him for the job (Val Kilmer) and the team of ultra-cool scientists who run the project (Adam Goldberg, Erika Alexander) tell him one story about the quantum physics behind this marvel of technology, the hotshot agent suspects that there is a greater power at their fingertips -- one that might not just solve the crime at hand, but prevent it(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Dutch has a code of honor which he will not violate, even when his life depends on it. Paradoxically, his code of honor gives him the backbone to survive as a military special forces operative when he is sent on a covert mission to rescue another group which was sent in to assist some nefarious U.S. government plan in a Latin American country. Once there, he encounters an old army buddy who has gotten too deep in the CIA's good graces for Dutch's comfort. When he and his team go into the jungle to rescue the others, they get involved in a pitched battle with local guerillas, but they are more than capable of besting these vicious fighters. However, not long after that, they encounter signs that the equally capable men they were sent to rescue were all killed unawares and in an unusually gruesome fashion. Given their training, it should have been impossible for anyone to best all of these commando warriors. Soon, the men from Dutch's own team get picked off one by one, as they grow aware that they are up against something uncanny, not of this world, something that is hunting them for sport. Why? Because their skills make them worthy opponents for the perfectly camouflaged Predator(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Obsession, jealousy, and deceit define the tense relationship shared between two turn-of-the-century magicians in Memento and Batman Begins director Christopher Nolan's dizzying tale of sleight of hand. Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are London-based magicians of the highest order, both blessed with spectacular powers of deception and both cursed with unrelenting envy for one another's skills. When Alfred performs an awe-inspiring trick for which there seems no logical explanation, the friendly competition shared between the pair turns to deadly rivalry as the enraged Rupert determines to uncover his rival's deepest secrets. In the world of illusion, however, nothing is ever quite as it seems, and the rules of the physical world simply don't apply. Now, as bitter competition quickly begins to consume the souls of both performers, the firestorm birthed by their anger threatens to consume all who surround them. Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, and David Bowie co-star in a feature that finds director/screenwriter Nolan reuniting with brother and Memento story author Jonathan Nolan to adapt author Christopher Priest's original novel(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Déjà vu</title>
    <desc lang="en">Adrenaline-loving director Tony Scott teams with iconic action producer Jerry Bruckheimer for this high-flung sci-fi action thriller concerning a New Orleans-based maverick ATF agent named Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington) who is brought in on a top-secret government program to catch the terrorist (Jim Caviezel) responsible for a ferry bombing that kills hundreds. Able to do what most law enforcement officers only dream of, Carlin is now able to look back in time at the perpetrator's movements, and at the life of the innocent woman whose death would set the events into motion. Carlin's instincts tell him that something is amiss, however, and while the government agent who tapped him for the job (Val Kilmer) and the team of ultra-cool scientists who run the project (Adam Goldberg, Erika Alexander) tell him one story about the quantum physics behind this marvel of technology, the hotshot agent suspects that there is a greater power at their fingertips -- one that might not just solve the crime at hand, but prevent it(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Predator</title>
    <desc lang="en">Dutch has a code of honor which he will not violate, even when his life depends on it. Paradoxically, his code of honor gives him the backbone to survive as a military special forces operative when he is sent on a covert mission to rescue another group which was sent in to assist some nefarious U.S. government plan in a Latin American country. Once there, he encounters an old army buddy who has gotten too deep in the CIA's good graces for Dutch's comfort. When he and his team go into the jungle to rescue the others, they get involved in a pitched battle with local guerillas, but they are more than capable of besting these vicious fighters. However, not long after that, they encounter signs that the equally capable men they were sent to rescue were all killed unawares and in an unusually gruesome fashion. Given their training, it should have been impossible for anyone to best all of these commando warriors. Soon, the men from Dutch's own team get picked off one by one, as they grow aware that they are up against something uncanny, not of this world, something that is hunting them for sport. Why? Because their skills make them worthy opponents for the perfectly camouflaged Predator(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Obsession, jealousy, and deceit define the tense relationship shared between two turn-of-the-century magicians in Memento and Batman Begins director Christopher Nolan's dizzying tale of sleight of hand. Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are London-based magicians of the highest order, both blessed with spectacular powers of deception and both cursed with unrelenting envy for one another's skills. When Alfred performs an awe-inspiring trick for which there seems no logical explanation, the friendly competition shared between the pair turns to deadly rivalry as the enraged Rupert determines to uncover his rival's deepest secrets. In the world of illusion, however, nothing is ever quite as it seems, and the rules of the physical world simply don't apply. Now, as bitter competition quickly begins to consume the souls of both performers, the firestorm birthed by their anger threatens to consume all who surround them. Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, and David Bowie co-star in a feature that finds director/screenwriter Nolan reuniting with brother and Memento story author Jonathan Nolan to adapt author Christopher Priest's original novel(n)</desc>

They invite a bevy of Hollywood types, including Skye Davidson (Gwyneth Paltrow), a young, beautiful, Ecstasy-pushing actress appointed to play a character based on Sally in the new feature film based on Joe's successful novel. Also featured are Cal and Sophia Gold (played by real-life marrieds Kevin Kline and Phoebe Cates), the former a co-star of Sally's and the latter her best friend who has given up the business to raise a family; Mac (John C. Reilly), the director of the new film and his actress wife Clair (Jane Adams), who has continued working after the recent birth of their child; Judy and Jerry Adams (Parker Posey and John Benjamin Hickey), the Therrians' managers; and Gina (Jennifer Beals), Joe's ex-girlfriend, who is often regarded as his first big love. Things are complicated when their contentious neighbors (Mina Badie and Denis O'Hare) make an appearance, and a mystery gift causes the event to unravel over the course of one long evening. The film was also written by Cumming and Leigh, another first for both actors(n)</desc>

Confetti is the United Kingdom's most prestigious wedding magazine, and publisher Antoni (Jimmy Carr) and editor Vivien (Felicity Montagu) have made a career out of documenting the cutting edge in nuptial ceremonies. Antoni and Vivien have decided to stage a contest to find the most original wedding concepts in Britain; the Confetti staff will narrow the field down to three candidates, help the couples stage their weddings, and treat the grand prize winner to a major photo spread in the magazine as well as a new home worth 500,000 pounds. Before long, Antoni and Vivien announce the finalists: Josef and Isabelle (Stephen Mangan and Meredith MacNeill), fitness enthusiasts who want a tennis-themed wedding; Matt and Sam (Martin Freeman and Jessica Stevenson), whose ceremony will be inspired by Hollywood movie musicals; and Michael and Joanna (Robert Webb and Olivia Colman), a pair of naturists who seldom wear clothes and want to be nude throughout the ceremony. Veteran wedding planners Archie Heron (Vincent Franklin) and Gregory Hough (Jason Watkins) are hired to help each couple have a day they'll always remember, though they may not look back on their work with fondness. Confetti was the second theatrical feature from director Debbie Isitt; all the dialogue was improvised by the film's cast during the filming(n)</desc>

This and other questions about modern relationships are explored in this offbeat romantic comedy. Amanda Pierce (Monica Potter) has found a great job (restoring paintings for the Metropolitan Museum of Art) and a great place to live: a spacious East Side apartment that she shares with four successful models, played by Ivana Milicevic, Shalom Harlow, Sarah O'Hare, and Tomiko Fraser. Amanda is still in the market for a great boyfriend, since most of her previous relationships have ended in broken promises or infidelity. She thinks she may have found the right guy in Jim Winston (Freddie Prinze Jr.), but she has reason to believe that he might be guilty of murder. Since she's not sure he has actually done anything, she decides to find out the truth, and her investigation has unexpectedly comic consequences. Head Over Heels was directed by Mark S.

    <title lang="en">To Sir, With Love II</title>
    <desc lang="en">Peter Bogdanovich directed this made-for-TV sequel to the well-remembered 1967 drama To Sir With Love. After 30 years as a teacher in a rough-and-tumble London school, Mark Thackeray (Sidney Poitier) finally retires and returns to America, settling into what he imagines will be a quiet life in Chicago. But Thackeray soon discovers that the nearby high school is not unlike the school he left behind in London -- run down, lacking discipline, and in dire need of teachers who genuinely care about their students. Thackeray decides to volunteer his services to the school, and soon finds himself teaching a history class to the toughest students he's ever had to face. Lulu and Judy Geeson, who starred as Poitier's students in the first film, make cameo appearances in To Sir With Love II, with Daniel J. Travanti and Jeff Sill highlighting the supporting cast of the sequel(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A girl puts her ability to keep a confidence to work, though she soon learns it's a tougher job than she imagined in this comedy drama for young people. Emily (Evan Rachel Wood) is a 14-year-old girl who loves music and is studying the violin. She has a real gift as a violinist, and has passed up the opportunity to go to summer camp with her friends to study with her tutor, Pauline (Vivica A. Fox), who believes Emily has a chance of landing a spot in the community symphony orchestra. Emily also has an unusual business on the side -- for 50 cents, she'll hear and keep other kids' secrets, and offer advice on how to keep incriminating facts away from parents, teachers, or other authority figures. However, she also has a secret of her own -- a new family has moved into the neighborhood, and while Philip (Michael Angarano), a year or two younger than Emily, quickly takes a liking to her, she immediately develops a crush on his older brother, David (David Gallagher). However, David has a habit of getting into trouble, and soon Emily is keeping some secrets she's prefer to get off her chest(n)</desc>

To remedy this situation, Cole links up with the Avatars to make a journey into the past, where he can establish an alternate reality in which Paige never makes the acquaintance of Phoebe and Piper (Holly Marie Combs), and thus never becomes a "Charmed One." The plot thickens when the demons of the past rear their ugly heads, and when Paige suddenly finds herself able to penetrate Cole's alternate reality thanks to a bad cold!(n)</desc>
