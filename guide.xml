    <title lang="en">The Dead Pool</title>
    <desc lang="en">The Dead Pool is the fifth and (thus far) the last of Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry movies. A sports pool is placing bets on which famous person will die next. Suddenly a serial killer who preys upon celebrities enters the scene, radically (and perhaps deliberately) changing the odds in the pool. As a celebrity of sorts, maverick cop Dirty Harry Callahan becomes a target of the killer, as does high-profile TV journalist Patricia Clarkson. Surprises are at a minimum in The Dead Pool; the film gets down to business quickly, moves logically if violently towards its climax (with a spectacular car-chase sequence thrown in for good measure), and delivers exactly what its fans expect. One major difference between this film and the earlier Dirty Harry epics is that the murders are committed in so outrageous a fashion that the picture seems at times to be a Freddie Krueger vehicle(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Rocker</title>
    <desc lang="en">(2008) This comedy from The Full Monty director Peter Cattaneo stars Rainn Wilson as a man whose life has well and truly fallen apart. Twenty years previously, Robert 'Fish' Fishman (Wilson) was heavy rock band Vesuvius's drummer. But when Vesuvius were offered a support slot for Whitesnake on the condition that they ditch their drummer, Fish found himself packing his sticks. Two decades later, he's been sacked from his dead-end job, ditched by his girlfriend and forced to move into his sister's attic. However, he unexpectedly - and unwittingly - gets another bite at stardom while preparing for a one-off gig with his 18-year-old nephew Josh's (Matt Gadman) band.

When police hostage negotiator Danny Roman unwittingly gets involved in a colleague's attempt to expose financial fraud within the force he quickly finds himself in very deep water. With the colleague found shot dead, and the embezzlement being pinned on him, Roman snaps and takes a surprising course of action: he turns his police role on its head and - in an effort to buy himself time to prove his innocence - takes hostage a number of people in the Internal Affairs Department, including his chief accuser Terence Niebaum. Roman's next step is to demand the presence of Chris Sabian, a fellow hostage negotiator who works on the other side of the city, and so, Roman hopes, is unconnected to the plot to frame him.

Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) became pregnant at 16, and, against the wishes of her mother and father (Edward Herrmann and Kelly Bishop), chose to keep the child and raise it on her own. Sixteen years later, Lorelai enjoys a warm relationship with her daughter, Rory (Alexis Bledel), but as Rory suffers the growing pains of being a teenager, Lorelai finds it's hard to be both mother and best friend. Lorelai also has to contend with her own parents, who still believe they know what's best for both Lorelai and Rory. Created as part of an initiative to bring more family-friendly drama to American television, Gilmore Girls debuted on the WB network on October 5, 2000; singer/songwriter Sam Phillips contributed music to the series(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">After six Oscar-nominations, Martin Scorsese finally picked up the statuette for this stunning, gripping crime thriller, based on the equally superb Hong Kong original Infernal Affairs . Matt Damon plays Colin Sullivan, the protégé of Boston gangster Frank Costello who has been groomed through police academy to become Frank's ears and eyes in the police department. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Billy Costigan, a cop deliberately disgraced so he can infiltrate Costello's gang to get enough information to bring him down. But Costello begins to smell a rat and demands Sullivan get him the name of the insider while Costigan realises the net may be closing in before he can get the information he needs. Superb performances from the three leads, with Nicholson reined in by Scorsese, supplemented by Oscar-nominee Mark Wahlberg as the foul-mouthed Sgt Dignam and Martin Sheen as Captain Queenan, Costigan's handlers who Sullivan must get past to find out his identity(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Panic Room</title>
    <desc lang="en">A well-regarded spec script by A-list screenwriter David Koepp became this stylish thriller from director David Fincher. Jodie Foster stars as Meg Altman, a single mother of an diabetic preteen daughter, Sarah (Kristen Stewart). Meg's going through an unhappy divorce that forces her and Sarah to move into a new home. They choose a deluxe New York brownstone that coincidentally boasts an unusual feature: a "panic room," a vault-like hidden space capable of literally sealing itself off from the rest of the building. With its thick steel door on springs, separate ventilation and communications systems, and video monitors linked to cameras mounted throughout the home, the room is an impregnable fortress. It quickly comes in handy when the Altmans' new residence is invaded by a trio of thieves: Junior (Jared Leto), Burnham (Forest Whitaker), and Raoul (Dwight Yoakam). Meg and Sarah are able to secure themselves in the panic room before the robbers can get to them, but it turns out that Sarah's medication is still on the outside, the phone's not yet connected, and the loot the gang's seeking is inside the panic room with them. A cat-and-mouse battle of wits ensues, with Meg trying to outwit their captors over the course of one very long night, as her daughter's health dissipates. Panic Room (2002) co-stars Ann Magnuson, Patrick Bauchau, and Koepp's fellow screenwriter, Andrew Kevin Walker, in a cameo role(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Heists</title>
    <sub-title lang="en">Secrets of the Great Train Robbery.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Crime documentary, which sets out to bust myths surrounding the effectiveness of the now-legendary Royal Mail train heist of August 8, 1963. The robbery saw the thieves walk away with around £2.5million, equivalent to nearly £50million in today's currency, and while similarly scaled heists have been mounted since, none has captured the public imagination in the same way. While the criminals responsible were eventually brought to justice, common perception still views them as successful in their endeavour. This programme aims to highlight the array of mistakes, bad decisions and careless errors that would prove to be the robbers' undoing. Includes contributions by two police officers involved in the investigation, and Tommy Wisbey, one of the last surviving members of the gang that did the deed.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A Murder in Greenwich: The Martha Moxley Case. (@A&amp;E) investigates the untouchables in American Justice: Martha Moxley. In the 1970s, as today, the Kennedy name carried a lot of clout. Its clan members were a hounded and romanticized group. But when trouble strikes too close to home, someone must be held accountable. Martha Moxley was an energetic teenager who resided in the prestigious neighborhood of Belle Haven in Greenwich, CT. After a night of Halloween parties, Moxley turned up beaten to death outside the home of Michael and Thomas Skakel, cousins to Robert Kennedy. For almost 25 years, the murder went unsolved. Rumors circulated that it was one of the two boys, who both professed a romantic interest in the popular girl. When a broken golf club used to kill Moxley was linked to the Skakel family, the case was still uninvestigated. A&amp;E asks why such a strong lead went ignored for so long and wonders if money can buy innocence(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">54</title>
    <desc lang="en">Mark Christopher wrote and directed this look back at the Disco Era when the popular Studio 54 was at its apogee in the late '70s. With obvious comparisons to Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights (1997) and Whit Stillman's The Last Days of Disco (1998), the story introduces working-class 19-year-old Irish-American Shane O'Shea (Ryan Phillippe), who has lived with his father and siblings since the death of his mother when he was 12. Shane quickly rises from busboy to bartender at Studio 54, co-owned and managed in a paternal manner by entrepreneur Steve Rubell (Mike Myers). Busboy Greg Randazzo (Breckin Meyer) and Greg's wife, Anita (Salma Hayek), the club's coat check girl, become Shane's new friends, and he encounters the possibility of romance with soap star Julie Black (Neve Campbell). The story spans the summer of 1979 until the decline of Studio 54 a year later with IRS investigations, followed by the arrest and jailing of Rubell. Costumes by Ellen Lutter capture the glitter and glam-glitz of the period(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Thick as Thieves</title>
    <desc lang="en">Two self-styled criminal masterminds find themselves in a turf battle neither much cares about in this underworld story that balances comedy against drama. Alec Baldwin plays Mackin, a career thief who picks his jobs shrewdly and carefully, and prefers to spend his downtime with his collection of rare jazz LP's and looking after his dog. Pointy (Michael Jai White) is a young upstart gangster trying to develop a taste for refinement and the good life. When Pointy sets up Mackin, Mackin is forced to retaliate, and before long both men and their associates are in the middle of a war neither is especially interested in winning, which begins to escalate in comic fashion. The skirmish eventually attracts the attention of a female cop (Rebecca De Mornay) who's become interested in Mackin's method of operation. Thick As Thieves received its world premiere at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">John Torode and Gregg Wallace present the penultimate heat. The six hopefuls begin by dishing up their calling card, a single plate of food showcasing their talent in the kitchen, followed by the invention test, in which the ingredients include rhubarb, lime, pomegranate and popping candy, or pollock, sausages, Parmesan and quail's eggs. After two cooks are sent home, things get serious, with the rest preparing a two-course dinner for 2007 MasterChef winner Steven Wallis, as well as Sara Danesin and Alex Rushmer, finalists from 2011 and 2010 respectively. It's then down to the judges to decide which two will advance to Friday's quarter-final.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The final heat sees the last new group of amateur cooks competing for a place in tomorrow's quarter-final. As usual, they begin by showing off their culinary skills with a single plate of food, before rustling up a dish in the invention test from either the sweet box, containing pineapple, white chocolate, digestives, pecan nuts, creme fraiche and sherry, or the savoury box, which has rabbit, smoked haddock, bacon, curly kale, vine tomatoes, baby turnips and leeks inside. After two hopefuls are shown the door, the rest cook a two-course meal for three guests - 2009 MasterChef champion Mat Follas, as well as previous finalists Andy Oliver and Tom Whitaker - before Gregg Wallace and John decide who will progress in the contest.(n)</desc>

Everyone knows the legend of Bloody Mary, but when three high-school friends jokingly recite an ancient incantation for what they believe to be a harmless prank, a vengeful spirit is unleashed and their fate sealed. Later abducted by a group of intimidating high-school jocks, the trio is soon rescued, only to bear witness as their tormentors one by one fall prey to a deadly but unseen menace. Could it be their imagination or could the spirit of Bloody Mary truly have returned from the grave to seek vengeance for her death and make anyone who crosses her path suffer a horrible and agonizing death?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Upon acquiring a mysterious book in which the number 23 seems to take on powerful cosmic significance, a once-sane man gradually becomes obsessed with the idea that the frequently recurring number may in fact hold a deadly secret in this intense mystery-thriller starring Jim Carrey and Virginia Madsen, and directed by Joel Schumacher. Walter Sparrow (Carrey) is a middle-aged dogcatcher whose wife Agatha (Madsen) has bestowed him with an obscure mystery novel detailing the investigation launched by a tough-talking gumshoe named Fingerling (also Carrey) whose every move seems to be overshadowed by the enigmatic eponymous number. After noting a series of alarming parallels shared between the fictional detective and himself, Walter is quickly drawn in to the story as the hard-boiled private investigator murders raven-wigged moll Fabrizia (also Madsen) and pins the crime on her unsuspecting lover (Danny Huston). Back in the real world, fiction seems to merge with reality as Walter and Agatha's close friend Isaac (also Huston) begins to ingratiate himself ever deeper into the couple's relationship and Walter begins experiencing a gruesome series of visions in which he violently murders an unfaithful Agatha. His mind fast descending into a dark and violent whirlwind of madness, Walter enlists the aid of Agatha and the pair's adolescent son Robin (Logan Lerman) in seeking out the author of the mysterious tome and uncovering the sinister truth behind the so-called "23 enigma."(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Upon acquiring a mysterious book in which the number 23 seems to take on powerful cosmic significance, a once-sane man gradually becomes obsessed with the idea that the frequently recurring number may in fact hold a deadly secret in this intense mystery-thriller starring Jim Carrey and Virginia Madsen, and directed by Joel Schumacher. Walter Sparrow (Carrey) is a middle-aged dogcatcher whose wife Agatha (Madsen) has bestowed him with an obscure mystery novel detailing the investigation launched by a tough-talking gumshoe named Fingerling (also Carrey) whose every move seems to be overshadowed by the enigmatic eponymous number. After noting a series of alarming parallels shared between the fictional detective and himself, Walter is quickly drawn in to the story as the hard-boiled private investigator murders raven-wigged moll Fabrizia (also Madsen) and pins the crime on her unsuspecting lover (Danny Huston). Back in the real world, fiction seems to merge with reality as Walter and Agatha's close friend Isaac (also Huston) begins to ingratiate himself ever deeper into the couple's relationship and Walter begins experiencing a gruesome series of visions in which he violently murders an unfaithful Agatha. His mind fast descending into a dark and violent whirlwind of madness, Walter enlists the aid of Agatha and the pair's adolescent son Robin (Logan Lerman) in seeking out the author of the mysterious tome and uncovering the sinister truth behind the so-called "23 enigma."(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Set 100 miles south of the setting of the Polish brothers' first feature, Twin Falls Idaho, Jackpot tells the story of Sunny Holiday Jon Gries, a down-on-his-luck karaoke dweller who has hopes of becoming a country singer. He has abandoned his feisty wife Bobbi (Daryl Hannah) and young daughter to set off on a nine-month road odyssey with his manager Lester Irving (Garrett Morris), in an effort to collect cash at local karaoke gigs. Lester grooms Sunny by choosing what songs he will do, keeping up with what the judges are like, and negotiating with competitors like Sammy Bones (Mac Davis), another traveling hopeful. On his road journey, he encounters several women, including Janice (Peggy Lipton), a club waitress, and Cheryl (Crystal Bernard), whom he takes home after she has an accident in a restroom, only to find himself being enticed by her underage daughter Tangerine (Camellia Clouse). The road trip comes to a stop, however, when Sunny is pulled over by police who claim that his vehicle is stolen and that Bobbi has reported it. Sunny then seeks refuge with brother Tracy (Anthony Edwards) while he decides his next move.

    <title lang="en">Haiku Tunnel</title>
    <desc lang="en">A temp worker is promoted to permanent status and finds his whole world changing as a result in this satiric comedy. Josh (Josh Kornbluth) is an overstuffed aspiring writer who is trying to finish his first novel, but in the meantime he supports himself by working as an office temp. Josh has grown accustomed to the Byzantine world of temporary labor, particularly the bossy secretaries and chilly co-workers, but Josh manages to impress his latest employers enough that they offer to make him a permanent, full-time employee. While a fellow temp who worked for the same company warns Josh that taking the job would be a mistake, Josh takes the plunge anyway, and soon discovers that his fellow employees now embrace him as one of their own. He also discovers that Bob Shelby (Warren Keith), his new boss, is more than a little crazy, and when Bob gives Josh an assignment to mail a series of important letters, John finds that he's suddenly incapable of doing this seemingly simple task. Instead, Josh spends his days working on his book (on company time and on a company computer), with his fellow office drones offering emphatic encouragement. Josh Kornbluth adapted Haiku Tunnel (with the help of John Bellucci and Jacob Kornbluth) from a semi-improvised one-man show Kornbluth created with David Ford; the Kornbluth brothers also directed the film(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days co-stars Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey re-team on the big screen for this adventurous tale about a treasure-hunting couple whose eight-year quest for the ultimate prize has left them flat broke and fresh out of gas. Ben "Finn" Finnegan (McConaughey) is a treasure hunter who has made it his mission in life to track down the Queen's Dowry -- a legendary collection of 40 chests filled with priceless treasure, and lost at sea in 1715. But in his single-minded quest to track down this sizable booty, Finn has sadly neglected his marriage to his loving wife Tess (Hudson). Tess has grown tired of the hunt, and now she's looking to start her life anew by going to work on the massive yacht of globetrotting billionaire Nigel Honeycutt (Donald Sutherland). But just as Tess begins to relish the freedom on her new, laid-back lifestyle, Finn uses his roughish charm to convince the adventurous baron and his debutante daughter Gemma (Alexis Dziena) that the elusive Spanish treasure is finally within reach. Of course no magnate in his right mind would reject the prospect of tracking down the most mythical treasure on the planet, and now as the hapless Tess is forced on yet another wild goose chase, her husband's former mentor Moe Fitch (Ray Winstone) and a greedy local gangster (Kevin Hart) up the stakes by joining in on the race(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The discovery of marital troubles in her family causes a young woman to question her own upcoming nuptials in this clever romantic comedy. Sarah Jessica Parker stars as Gwyn, a bright, slightly neurotic advertising copywriter who is initially thrilled when her boyfriend Matt (Gil Bellows) finally proposes. Soon afterwards, however, she learns that her mother Nina (Mia Farrow) is indulging in an extra-marital affair with a handsome Latin stud (Antonio Banderas). This is only the first of several shocking revelations, as Gwyn soon learns of infidelity by her father (Paul Mazursky), brother (Kevin Pollack), and even newlywed sister (Carla Gugino). These indiscretions make Gwyn question the validity of the entire institution of marriage and doubt her own future. Director David Frankel, who also penned the screenplay, follows in the footsteps of Woody Allen in using introspective dialogue to detail the romantic troubles of a wealthy, neurotic Jewish family; practiced performances and a colorful use of Miami locations give the film its own personality(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">He's mean, he's green, and he's doesn't like the Yuletide season one bit -- Jim Carrey stars in this live-action adaptation of the classic children's story by Dr. Seuss (aka Theodore Geisel). High atop Mt. Crumpet, the Grinch (Carrey) observes the residents of Whoville joyously preparing to celebrate Christmas. The Grinch was born in Whoville years ago, but was shunned due to his scary appearance, and his unrequited love for Martha May Whovier has turned him bitter; the good cheer of the Whos has been a thorn in his side ever since. Finally the Grinch decides he's had enough of all this happiness, and with the wary aid of his dog Max, the Grinch conspires to steal Christmas from Whoville, making off with their presents, holiday decorations, Christmas trees, and everything else used to enjoy the holiday. Molly Shannon, Christine Baranski, Jeffrey Tambor, and Clint Howard play several of the citizens of Whoville, while Anthony Hopkins narrates (taking over from the late Boris Karloff, who memorably read Dr. Seuss' story in Chuck Jones' 1966 animated adaptation of the story).

    <desc lang="en">Writer/director Steven Knight's Redemption stars Jason Statham as a British Special Forces veteran named Smith who has fallen on very hard times. He's an alcoholic homeless man huddling inside a box on a dingy London alley with a fellow homeless woman when a couple of criminals start harassing the junkies and the destitute. He reverts to his training, subdues the baddies, and makes a run for it, ending up in the home of a wealthy creative type who happens to be in New York for the next eight months. Smith movies in, cleans himself up, and gets a job as a toughman for a local Asian gangster. Haunted by horrific acts he committed while serving in Afghanistan, he spends much of the money he makes now to help fund a local soup kitchen run by Sister Cristina (Agata Buzek). When the woman he was with at the beginning of the movie turns up dead, Smith decides to hunt down the man responsible. Meanwhile, Cristina questions her own faith, confronts her haunted past, and makes Smith contemplate his own violent nature. Redemption is the feature directorial debut for Knight, who had previously scripted Eastern Promises and Dirty Pretty Things(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Happening</title>
    <desc lang="en">Lady in the Water director M. Night Shyamalan puts PG-13 suspense on pause to tell this grim apocalyptic tale about a family fleeing a natural disaster that poses a grave threat to the whole of humanity. Philadelphia high-school science teacher Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) is discussing the disappearance of the bees with his students when the staff is summoned to the theater and briefed about a mysterious event that is currently unfolding in New York City. According to reports, citizens in the vicinity of Central Park have suddenly and inexplicably begun seizing up just before killing themselves by whatever means are at their disposal. As the phenomena begins to spread and talk of terrorism fills the airwaves, Elliot, his wife, Alma (Zooey Deschanel), their friend Julian (John Leguizamo), and his daughter, Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez), board a train bound for the presumed safety of the country. When the train screeches to a halt before arriving at its final destination, however, the frightened passengers are forced to fend for themselves as each consecutive news report paints an increasingly grim picture of the situation in more urbanized areas. Theories abound on what could be causing the unexplainable rash of suicides, but the only thing that everyone seems to agree on is that it's some kind of airborne contagion that is carried in the wind. It would appear that humankind's reign on planet Earth has come to an end, but perhaps if this small band of survivors can find a safe place to lie low until this all blows over, all hope for survival of the species might not be lost just yet(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Sinkholes: Buried Alive</title>
    <desc lang="en">An investigation into sinkholes, a natural phenomenon that sees the ground give away as a result of weak acid attacking the rocks below, riddling them with holes like Swiss cheese.

This documentary features video footage of dramatic collapses and follows scientists as they explore the underlying forces behind these natural disasters.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The arrival of Martin Scorsese's remake of the classic 1962 thriller stars Robert De Niro as pychopath Max Cady, out of prison after fourteen years and bent on revenge. The object of his hate is Sam Bowden, the lawyer who failed in his defence of Cady at the latter's trial. Now Sam and his family (wife Jessica Lange and daughter Juliette Lewis, in an outstanding debut) are about to be terrorized by Max, who is determined that they should "learn something about loss". But the Bowden family are not themselves completely innocent: both women find themselves strangely attracted to the murderer, and Sam himself may have withheld some vital evidence at Cady's trial which could have changed the jury's verdict(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The arrival of Martin Scorsese's remake of the classic 1962 thriller stars Robert De Niro as pychopath Max Cady, out of prison after fourteen years and bent on revenge. The object of his hate is Sam Bowden, the lawyer who failed in his defence of Cady at the latter's trial. Now Sam and his family (wife Jessica Lange and daughter Juliette Lewis, in an outstanding debut) are about to be terrorized by Max, who is determined that they should "learn something about loss". But the Bowden family are not themselves completely innocent: both women find themselves strangely attracted to the murderer, and Sam himself may have withheld some vital evidence at Cady's trial which could have changed the jury's verdict(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Felicia's Journey</title>
    <desc lang="en">Directed by Atom Egoyan, Felicia's Journey is a low-key psychological thriller about the relationship between a lovesick young woman and an older man with an ugly secret. Felicia (Elaine Cassidy) has lived all of her life in a small village in rural Ireland. She has fallen in love with a boy named Johnny (Peter McDonald), so when Johnny unexpectedly travels to England in search of a job, Felicia wants to follow him -- especially since she's pregnant, a fact that she's keeping secret from her family, as well as Johnny. However, Johnny's family refuses to give her his address, so she leaves for Birmingham with only a sketchy idea of his whereabouts. Shortly after arriving, Felicia encounters Joseph Ambrose Hilditch (Bob Hoskins), the meticulous manager of a catering concern. She needs a place to stay and he recommends a good bed-and-breakfast. They soon become friendly, but Hilditch is more than just a mildly eccentric middle-aged man with a taste for French cuisine: he's had a long history of using and abusing homeless women, and Felicia looks like she's doomed to be the next victim. Based on a novel by William Trevor, Felicia's Journey was shown in competition at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Cookout</title>
    <desc lang="en">When Todd Anderson (Storm P) signs a 30-million-dollar contract with the New Jersey Nets after being named the number one NBA draft pick of the year, his mother (Jenifer Lewis) vows to prevent her son from forgetting his roots. Not used to balancing his new life with his old, Todd mistakenly invites family and friends from his old neighborhood to his multi-million-dollar house for a cookout on the same day of an important endorsement interview. Though his extravagant family cookouts were welcome at his old digs, Todd's stuffy new neighbors -- particularly the conservative Republican Judge Halsted Crowley (Danny Glover) -- are less than thrilled with the arrival of Todd's massive family. Complicating the situation further is the eccentric neighborhood security guard (Queen Latifah), who takes on the heady assignment of ensuring that none of the private community's rules are broken, as well as two thugs who, determined to get an autographed pair of sneakers, hold up the cookout at gunpoint. Directed by Lance Rivera, The Cookout also features performances from Ja Rule, Eve, Farrah Fawcett, and Jonathan Silverman(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Tyler Perry's Diary of a Mad Black Woman</title>
    <desc lang="en">A woman has to learn how to love and trust men all over again in this comedy drama. Helen McCarter (Kimberly Elise) would seem to have it all -- she's been married for 18 years to Charles (Steve Harris), and over the course of their time together, he's become one of Atlanta's most successful attorneys. But despite wealth and prestige, things are not as they should be at the McCarter home, and on their anniversary, Charles drops a bombshell on Helen -- he's divorcing her for another woman. Escorted out of the house with nowhere to go, Helen moves in with her grandmother Madea (Tyler Perry), a sassy woman with no shortage of opinions and a gun that she's not afraid to use. As Madea helps Helen get back on her feet emotionally, the divorcée makes the acquaintance of Orlando (Shemar Moore), a handsome man who is obviously attracted to her. But after her experiences with Charles, Helen isn't sure if she's ready to trust a man again. Diary of a Mad Black Woman was adapted from the popular stage play by Tyler Perry, who also plays several roles in the film, most prominently Madea; it marked the first feature-film credit for successful music video director Darren R.

    <desc lang="en">Rick Famuyiwa's comedy/drama stars Taye Diggs, Richard T Jones from Phone Booth and Omar Epps, seen meeting up on Digg's wedding day. Or rather, not meeting up - he's done a runner but his friends track him down and as they try to give him the courage to make it to the wedding. Their stories are recounted from their youth in the 80s (with Trent Cameron, Duane Finley and Sean Nelson as the younger versions), when they met at high school and follows them through their rites-of-passage - dating, getting involved in a store robbery by mistake, getting their first jobs. Famuyiwa's debut movie, following three black middle class teenagers, has a certain charm and the three leads are ably supported by a cast including Malinda Williams as the cutest girl in school and Tamal Jones as the ex-girlfriend Diggs seeks refuge with in the Wood rather than the Hood(n)</desc>

In between bits, Griffin takes us on a tour of his home town of Kansas City, where we get to meet his mother, who has a remarkable enthusiasm for corporal punishment; his uncle, who discusses his remarkable enthusiasm for pornography; and another uncle, who proved to be an invaluable help to Griffin's early career despite his drug habit and career as a pimp.

    <sub-title lang="en">The Silence</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The Silence. Fed up with the loud and incessant talking of fellow men's club member Jamie Tennyson (Liam Sullivan), pompous Col. Archie Taylor (Franchot Tone) decides to place a most unusual wager. With $500,000 at stake, Taylor bets that Tennyson cannot remain silent for a full year. Deeply in debt, Tennyson accepts the wager, and even permits himself to be placed in a glass cage in the club's basement, so that Taylor and the other members can monitor his silence. Though the story contains no science-fiction or fantasy trappings whatsover, the ironic ending is very much in keeping with the standards set by previous Twilight Zone episodes. First telecast April 28, 1961, "The Silence" was scripted by Rod Serling -- and though Serling denied it at the time, the story would seem to have been influenced by Anton Chekhov's "The Bet."(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Mechanic</title>
    <desc lang="en">(2011) Jason Statham stars in director Simon West's action retread of Michael Winner's 1972 revenge thriller (which featured Charles Bronson in the lead role). Arthur Bishop (Statham) earns his living as a 'mechanic', a euphemism for hitman that alludes to the precision and emotional detachment with which he goes about his business. And that even applies when he's contracted to kill his wheelchair-using mentor Harry McKenna (Donald Sutherland), though he does at least demand to know why he should send his friend to an early grave. Things then get awkward for Bishop, when McKenna's son Steve (Ben Foster) asks if he'll tutor him. Their partnership develops in fits and starts (and several deaths), but Bishop's boss Dean Sanderson (Tony Goldwyn) makes it clear he's not happy with the nascent partnership's latest assassination. So, with all the main players inherently suspicious, trained killers, and various motives for murder in the air, it won't take much to spark bloodshed - and that catalyst comes with an unexpected sighting at an airport..(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Strong-armed into transporting the kidnapped daughter of the head of the Environmental Agency for the Ukraine from Marseilles to Odessa, skilled wheelman Frank Martin (Jason Statham) enlists the aid of Inspector Tarconi (François Berléand) in accomplishing the treacherous assignment in this action-packed installment of the popular action series produced by Luc Besson (who also co-scripts). Frank isn't exactly thrilled with his latest assignment, but when his employer turns up the pressure, he has little choice but to deliver. His cargo is a feisty young girl named Valentina (Natalya Rudakova) -- who just happens to be the daughter of Leonid Vasilev (Jeroen Krabbé), the powerful top dog of the Ukraine EPA. Now, as Frank makes his way through Stuttgart and Budapest on the road to the Black Sea, Vasilev's men besiege his car from all sides, and his cynical young passenger gets a bad case of Stockholm Syndrome. As the driver and his cargo grow increasingly close, they both realize that making even a single mistake could cost them dearly(n)</desc>
