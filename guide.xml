One night, local newspaper reporter Kevin (James Marsden) spots the devoted bridal attendant racing between receptions in Manhattan and Brooklyn, and quickly surmises that her quirky tale may be just the story to get him off the bridal beat and into the big time. Immediately suspicious of the cynical reporter's motivations, Jane butts heads with Kevin just as her younger sister Tess (Malin Akerman) shows up in town. While Jane has always put the needs of friends and family before her own wants and desires, she's suddenly prompted to reevaluate her priorities when her boss -- with whom she is secretly in love -- falls for her younger sister Tess. When Tess and Jane's boss George (Edward Burns) make plans to marry, the smitten younger sibling mistakenly assumes that her lovelorn older sibling will be happy to take part in the wedding. For as far back as Jane can remember, she has sacrificed her own happiness for the sake of those she holds dearest, but now that her heart has been broken, she's finally found the courage to be honest with herself. Now, as Jane finally comes to terms with her true feelings, her life begins to change in ways she never expected. Judy Greer and Melora Hardin co-star in a romantic comedy scripted by The Devil Wears Prada screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna and directed by Anne Fletcher (Step Up)(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A overgrown mama's boy who hasn't found the courage to take flight from the nest gets a little help from the girl of his dreams in the one comedy that proves it's never to late to strike out on your own. Tripp (Matthew McConaughey) may have hit 30, but that doesn't mean that he's ready to give up the many benefits of living at home with mom (Kathy Bates) and dad (Terry Bradshaw). His desperate parents have had enough, though, and after years of gentle nudging they soon realize that it's going to take a concerted effort to get Tripp out and enjoy their twilight years in peace. Realizing that their only hope for ridding themselves of their reluctant-to-leave offspring rides on the off-chance of his meeting the ideal female companion, mom and dad enlist the help of a beautiful and talented woman (Sarah Jessica Parker) in providing the romantic incentive needed to finally get their son out of the family home(n)</desc>

Well, what about seeking out and vetting potential suitors for her daughter via the internet? And thus Daphne sets in train the inevitable series of misunderstandings that may or may not lead to Milly getting together with the man who looks most likely to be her Mr Right, musician Johnny; unless, of course, he turns out to be architect Jason.

    <desc lang="en">Julia Child's story as a 1950s cookbook author is intertwined with blogger Julia Powell's 2002 attempt to cook all 524 recipes from Child's debut book in one year. Julia Child became a national celebrity when her debut cookbook Mastering the Art of French Cooking brought French cuisine to American housewives in the 50s. Later, in 2002, aspiring New York writer Julie Powell decides to cook all 524 recipes in 365 days and write a blog charting her efforts. Her obsession certainly tests the patience of her husband, but her determination to complete the mammoth challenge remains solid, with all culinary triumphs and kitchen disasters committed to the web along the way(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Buying the Cow</title>
    <desc lang="en">After five years of dating, David (Jerry O'Connell) gets what he feels is an ultimatum from his girlfriend, Sarah (Bridgette Wilson). She thinks they should get married. When his old buddy, Tyler (Ron Livingston of Swingers), a legendary womanizer, calls to announce his wedding plans, it only increases the pressure on David. When Sarah leaves town on a business trip, David has a chance to explore his options. He turns to his friends, Jonesey (Bill Bellamy), and the unrepentant lothario Michael (Ryan Reynolds, who also starred in director Walt Becker's National Lampoon's Van Wilder) for advice. Jonesey half-heartedly encourages David to marry Sarah. Michael, who treats women shabbily, tries to talk David out of it. David tells his friends about an epiphany that he had many years earlier, when he saw beautiful blond Julie (Erinn Bartlett) in an airport, and was instantly smitten. He knew she was the one. He courageously handed the strange girl his phone number, and a brief romantic correspondence ensued, but it ended disastrously. Uncertain about his destiny with Sarah, David spots another woman at a Mexican restaurant, and has the same feeling he had with Julie. He spends a lot of time and effort trying to track this mystery woman down, while Sarah, frustrated by their lack of progress, considers ending their relationship. Michael, meanwhile, has a real identity crisis, when he wakes up in a strange bed after a night of drinking, drugs, and debauchery, only to find a gay man in the bedroom with him. Buying the Cow also stars Alyssa Milano, Annabeth Gish, and Jon Tenney. The film was co-written by director Becker and Peter W. Nelson(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Director Frank Darabont, who made an acclaimed feature film debut with The Shawshank Redemption (1994), based on a Stephen King novel set in a prison, returns for a second feature, based on King's 1996 serialized novel set in a prison. In 1935, inmates at the Cold Mountain Correctional Facility call Death Row "The Green Mile" because of the dark green linoleum that tiles the floor. Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) is the head guard on the Green Mile when a new inmate is brought into his custody: John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), convicted of the sadistic murder of two young girls. Despite his size and the fearsome crimes for which he's serving time, Coffey seems to be a kind and well-mannered person who behaves more like an innocent child than a hardened criminal. Soon Edgecomb and two of his fellow guards, Howell (David Morse) and Stanton Barry Pepper), notice something odd about Coffey: he's able to perform what seem to be miracles of healing among his fellow inmates, leading them to wonder just what sort of person he could be, and if he could have committed the crimes with which he was charged. The Green Mile also stars James Cromwell as the warden; Michael Jeter, Sam Rockwell, and Graham Greene as inmates awaiting dates with the electric chair; and Harry Dean Stanton as a clever trustee(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Richard Hammond presents this chilly version of Total Wipeout, which sees the contestants wrapping up warm to tackle a snow-covered course with winter-themed obstacles and seasonal challenges. They must manoeuvre themselves past Granny's House, watching out for the angry dog nipping at their ankles and a front door guaranteed to smack them in the face. They then cling onto the ski lift to avoid plunging into the icy waters, before riding the conveyor belt that throws them onto those old Wipeout favourites, the big red balls. Amanda Byram laughs it up at the side of the course.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Prince Philip: The Plot to Make a King</title>
    <desc lang="en">Secret History documentary telling the inside story of the dynastic tensions that were unleashed when Princess Elizabeth, the future queen, fell in love with Prince Philip. It was felt that Philip was rough and ill-mannered - and with the Second World War still fresh in most people's minds, the royal and political elite disliked his German roots. But following the death of King George VI in 1952, the establishment feared a dynastic coup, with the Queen torn between the two sides. The documentary examines the complexities and frustrations of the royal marriage, as the monarch struggled to reconcile the love of her husband with the suspicions of her family and her government.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Harold &amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay</title>
    <desc lang="en">After successfully seeking out the ultimate slider in the 2004 stoner comedy Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle, the cannabis-craving twosome returns in this high-flying sequel that finds them labeled terrorists for attempting to sneak a marijuana-smoking implement on a flight to Amsterdam. Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) have just finished gorging themselves on savory White Castle hamburgers when they return to their apartment and hatch a plan for Harold to win the heart of his crush, Maria (Paula Garcés). Maria is going to Amsterdam, and if Harold can catch up with her overseas perhaps he can strike up a real love connection. After a close call with airport personnel and a chance encounter with Kumar's ex-girlfriend Vanessa (Danneel Harris) -- who hadn't yet told Kumar that she's engaged to be married -- the pot-loving pals finally board their flight for Amsterdam. Unfortunately for Harold, Kumar isn't able to endure the lengthy flight without an innocent puff or two from his smokeless bong. When the plane hits some turbulence and the bong is mistaken for a bomb, the flight is diverted to Guantanamo Bay and our spliff-smoking heroes are detained by overzealous Deputy Chief of Homeland Security Ron Fox (Rob Corddry). Now, if they can just escape from the world's most notorious prison compound, perhaps this hapless duo can succeed in convincing the authorities that they aren't enemy combatants, and that Kumar made the mistake of his life by letting Vanessa go. But before they can prove their innocence and get the girls, Harold and Kumar will have to outsmart the dreaded Ku Klux Klan, contend with a particularly precocious Cyclops baby, and successfully elude everyone's favorite debauched former child star -- Neil Patrick Harris(n)</desc>

Their deeds often merit stiffer penalties and unforgiving jurors. A&amp;E explores the most notorious of this lot in the one-hour American Justice: Cop Killers. Named after an Ice-T song that attracted negative attention for its hateful lyrics, the program follows a man who blames music for his deed. Ronald Ray Howard claims rap made him assassinate a policeman during a routine traffic stop. Leroy Strachan was convicted 40 years after he murdered a cop for telling him not to enter a ballpark after hours. Perhaps most well-known is the videotaped killing of Texas Constable Darrell Lunsford who stopped a car transporting drugs. His dashboard camera captured it all. A&amp;E also visits the officers who dedicate their lives to finding cop killers and the prosecutors who put them away(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">A Murder in Greenwich: The Martha Moxley Case</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">A Murder in Greenwich: The Martha Moxley Case. (@A&amp;E) investigates the untouchables in American Justice: Martha Moxley. In the 1970s, as today, the Kennedy name carried a lot of clout. Its clan members were a hounded and romanticized group. But when trouble strikes too close to home, someone must be held accountable. Martha Moxley was an energetic teenager who resided in the prestigious neighborhood of Belle Haven in Greenwich, CT. After a night of Halloween parties, Moxley turned up beaten to death outside the home of Michael and Thomas Skakel, cousins to Robert Kennedy. For almost 25 years, the murder went unsolved. Rumors circulated that it was one of the two boys, who both professed a romantic interest in the popular girl. When a broken golf club used to kill Moxley was linked to the Skakel family, the case was still uninvestigated. A&amp;E asks why such a strong lead went ignored for so long and wonders if money can buy innocence(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May embark on a road trip, trying to follow the path of the Three Wise Men across the Middle East. However, they opt to do so in open-top sports cars that were built for significantly less demanding tasks than driving along the conflict-ridden mountains of southern Turkey, through war-ravaged Iraq and across the searing deserts of Syria. The trio also try to find out what myrrh is and where it can be bought.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May put three supercars through their paces in Italy. Their weapons of choice are the 691bhp Lamborghini Aventador, McLaren's hi-tech MP4-12C, and a British brute in the form of the Noble M600. The journey begins at Nardo, a high-speed testing ground so vast it can be seen from space, and includes a nerve-racking drive in Rome before reaching its conclusion with a timed challenge against the Stig at the Imola circuit. The trio are also joined by The Voice mentor Will.i am, who takes the wheel of the Reasonably Priced Car.(n)</desc>

The experts believe they have may uncover the remains of a medieval building, probably belonging to the infamous Cheyne family.

    <sub-title lang="en">First Steps.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Naturalist David Attenborough documents the universal tale that unites humanity with every other animal on the planet - the journey through life, and the goal to continue the bloodline through offspring. This edition focuses on the first hurdle any animal will face, surviving infancy. Cameras follow flightless barnacle goose chicks as they strive to find food, leaping 400ft down a cliff from the ledge where they hatched. Meanwhile, in New Zealand, young fur seals have stumbled across a safe haven in which they can learn how to avoid predators, while deep in the Gobi Desert, the long-eared jerboa learns to use its impeccable hearing to catch insect pray. Plus, albatross chicks make their first flight, as threatening tiger sharks wait patiently for them to slip up and land in the sea.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">First Steps.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Naturalist David Attenborough documents the universal tale that unites humanity with every other animal on the planet - the journey through life, and the goal to continue the bloodline through offspring. This edition focuses on the first hurdle any animal will face, surviving infancy. Cameras follow flightless barnacle goose chicks as they strive to find food, leaping 400ft down a cliff from the ledge where they hatched. Meanwhile, in New Zealand, young fur seals have stumbled across a safe haven in which they can learn how to avoid predators, while deep in the Gobi Desert, the long-eared jerboa learns to use its impeccable hearing to catch insect pray. Plus, albatross chicks make their first flight, as threatening tiger sharks wait patiently for them to slip up and land in the sea.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This daily show-biz gossip and "expose" series was a spinoff of the popular interactive website TMZ, an acronym for the "Thirty Mile Zone" surrounding Hollywood. Created in 2005, TMZ had gained national prominence by breaking the story of Mel Gibson's anti-Semitic tirade after his arrest for drunken driving. By the time the TV version of TMZ premiered the week of September 10, 2007, the operation had once again scooped its scandal-rag competition with its coverage of O.J. Simpson's profanity-laden "invasion" of the home of a collectibles dealer who was allegedly selling Simpson memorabilia without permission. In fact, TMZ on TV had a wealth of celebrity-meltdown yarns to choose from during its shakedown week, ranging from the substance-abuse problems of Lindsay Lohan to the ill-fated "comeback" concert of Britney Spears. Harvey Levin, managing editor for both versions of TMZ, appeared on-camera as a correspondent, along with Sean Borg, Michael Hundgen, Katie Darryl and Teresa Strasser.

    <desc lang="en">Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington. After a free copy of the magazine Reading Digest arrives in the mail, Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) becomes a sudden (if short-lived) convert to the joys of the written word, and when he discovers the magazine is sponsoring a children's essay competition for "Patriots of Tomorrow," he urges Lisa (voice of Yeardley Smith) to enter. Lisa's essay is good enough to land her in the competition finals, and the Simpson family is flown to Washington D.C., all expenses paid, for the occasion. While Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright) teaches Homer some lessons about the value of room service, Lisa spots one of Springfield's congressmen taking a bribe from a lobbyist to bypass environmental legislation. Angry and disillusioned, Lisa tosses away her essay about the value of democracy and instead reads a new one about the spread of political corruption in the United States, little realizing the lengths to which the federal government will go to ensure that one little girl can believe in the integrity of America's leadership. "Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington" was first aired on September 26, 1991(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Tin Cup</title>
    <desc lang="en">Golfing drama about a washed-up old pro who tries to get back into the big time. Roy 'Tin Cup' McAvoy (Kevin Costner) ruined his career when he took a risk on the golf course which led to his disqualification from the game. Now he teaches golf to others at a driving range in Salome, Texas, with the help of his trusted friend Romeo Posar (Cheech Marin). But McAvoy's life starts to change when a new student walks into the training centre - Dr Molly Griswold (Rene Russo), who just happens to be dating PGA star David Simms (Don Johnson). To win Molly, 'Tin Cup' knows that he must impress her - and what better way than by beating Simms and winning the US Open? The problem, of course, is that 'Tin Cup' has been teaching golf for so long that he may have forgotten how to play!(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Black Swan</title>
    <desc lang="en">Natalie Portman gives an Oscar-winning performance in Darren Aronofsky's brooding psychological drama. Nina Sayers is an exceptional ballerina who may get her big break when a New York ballet company decides to retire their current star. But to achieve her dream she must overcome three potential obstacles. First there's the suffocating influence of her mother, whose vicarious ambition has relentlessly bulldozed Nina to the brink of success, but which also continues to make her life hellish. Thomas Leroy, the company's director, thinks Nina is perfect as the Swan Queen, but lacks the required edgy sensuality for the other half of the lead's twin role, the Black Swan; and predictably enough he's more than happy to help her with this. Lastly there's Nina's mental health, which is fragile at the best of times, though more often she's on the edge of a full-scale breakdown. Into this heady mix comes another new dancer, the beautiful and alluring Lily, who offers Nina support, and more. But is it genuine friendship, or does Lily intend to claim the lead role for herself?(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Riding in Cars With Boys</title>
    <desc lang="en">Penny Marshall directed this serio-comic story, based on the memoir by Beverly Donofrio, about a young woman who finds her life radically altered by an event from her teen years. Born in 1950, Beverly (Drew Barrymore) grew up bright and ambitious in a working-class neighborhood in Connecticut; her father (James Woods) was a tough but good-hearted cop with an understanding ear for his daughter's problems, and her mother (Lorraine Bracco) was a nervous woman eager to imagine the worst. From an early age, Beverly displays a keen intelligence and an interest in literature, and she dreams of going to college in New York and becoming a writer. However, she also develops a precocious interest in boys, and at 15 finds herself madly in love with a boy from her high school. However, an attempt to get his attention leads to an embarassing incident at a party, and Ray Hasek (Steve Zahn), a sweet but thick-headed 18-year-old, steps forward to defend her. Beverly and Ray end up making out, and after one thing leads to another, Beverly discovers she's pregnant. Telling Ray is only marginally less difficult than informing her parents, and at 16, Beverly is a wife and mother. Against the odds, Beverly is determined to still finish high school and go on to college, but that goal becomes more difficult with time, especially after Beverly's marriage begins to fall apart; while Ray tries to do the right thing, he has trouble holding a job, and circumstances become all the more difficult when Beverly learns her husband is addicted to heroin. Riding in Cars With Boys also stars Brittany Murphy as Beverly's best friend Fay; Beverly's son Jason is played, at various points in his life, by Adam Garcia (age 20), Logan Lerman (age eight), Cody Arens (age six), and Logan Arens (age three)(n)</desc>

Nick gets an unexpected jolt of excitement when, nursing a hangover, he's the only one not to evacuate an office building that becomes a disaster area after a mishap involving nuclear testing equipment. An unexpected by-product of the accident is that it turns the molecules of the building, as well as Nick and the clothes he's wearing, transparent. When a team of shady government agents, led by David Jenkins (Sam Neill), notices that a human has been turned invisible, they try to take him into custody, planning to use him as the most dangerous secret intelligence agent the world has ever known. Distrusting their motives, the frantic and confused Nick escapes, and quickly begins learning new information about his unusual condition, such pragmatic details as trying to sleep when he can see through his eyelids and any unprocessed food he eats will give him away. Soon, however, he discovers that the scientist in charge of the experiments (Jim Norton) has no idea how to return him to normal, and begins plotting how best to live a semblance of a normal life while steering clear of his pursuers. Nick involves a beautiful woman he met the night before the accident (Daryl Hannah) in his dilemma, and soon she too becomes a target. Memoirs of an Invisible Man was adapted from a book by H.F.

Jamal has soon allied himself with a peasant girl and a broken-down ex-knight to defeat the evil King Leo (Kevin Conway) and his bullying minion, Sir Knolte (Tom Wilkinson). In the meantime, Jamal busts some modern dance moves on the medieval dance floor and encounters such intriguing residents of the period as knaves, peasants, archers, jousting knights, maidens, a princess, and even a giant. Black Knight (2001) is the sophomore directing vehicle of longtime television producer Gil Junger, who joins Lawrence in replacing the team originally attached to this comic vehicle, director F.

    <title lang="en">Brother</title>
    <desc lang="en">Japanese action director Takeshi Kitano brings his unique style to America in his first (predominantly) English-language film, shot in the United States and financed by Japanese and British production companies. Yamamoto (Beat Takeshi) is a Japanese gangster who decides it's a good time to get out of Tokyo after a dalliance with a rival branch of the yakuza causes his boss to be killed. Yamamoto flies to Los Angeles and tries to locate his bother Ken (Claude Maki), who is involved in organized crime in California. However, before Yamamoto can track down his sibling, he runs afoul of Denny (Omar Epps), an African-American drug dealer who isn't about to take any back talk from a Japanese tourist. Yamamoto soon discovers, however, that Denny happens to be one of Ken's partners, and soon the adversaries are working together, cautiously developing a mutual respect as Yamamoto becomes one of the new kingpins in the Los Angeles drug cartels. But Denny and Yamamoto may have bitten off more than they can chew when they decide to declare war on the Italian syndicate after aligning themselves with another emigre from the yakuza, Shirase (Masaya Kato). Incidentally, Takeshi Kitano and Beat Takeshi are actually the same person, the latter being the stage name he adopted for use as an actor and stand-up comic(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Sin City author Frank Miller's sweeping take on the historic Battle of Thermopylae comes to the screen courtesy of Dawn of the Dead director Zack Snyder. Gerard Butler stars as Spartan King Leonidas and Lena Headey plays Queen Gorgo. The massive army of the Persian Empire is sweeping across the globe, crushing every force that dares stand in its path. When a Persian envoy arrives in Sparta offering King Leonidas power over all of Greece if he will only bow to the will of the all powerful Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro), the strong-willed leader assembles a small army comprised of his empire's best fighters and marches off to battle. Though they have virtually no hope of defeating Xerxes' intimidating battalion, Leonidas' men soldier on, intent on letting it be known they will bow to no man but their king. Meanwhile, back in Sparta, the loyal Queen Gorgo attempts to convince both the skeptical council and the devious Theron (Dominic West) to send more troops despite the fact that many view Leonidas' unsanctioned war march as a serious transgression. As Xerxes' fearsome "immortals" draw near, a few noble Greeks vow to assist the Spartans on the battlefield. When King Leonidas and his 300 Spartan warriors fell to the overwhelming Persian army at the Battle of Thermopylae, the fearless actions of the noble fighters inspired all of Greece to stand up against their Persian enemy and wage the battle that would ultimately give birth to the modern concept of democracy(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Recount</title>
    <desc lang="en">(2008) Jay Roach's timely film is the story of the 2000 US Presidential election when George W Bush beat Al Gore. But for days the result was in dispute, thanks to the hanging and dimpled chads on the ballot papers of the state of Florida. Kevin Spacey plays Ron Klain, Al Gore's chief of staff, Tom Wilkinson plays his adversary James Baker III and Dennis Leary plays Michael Whouley, a Gore staffer who 'talks' the audience through the complexities of the legal challenges. But the film is stolen by Laura Dern as Katherine Harris, the Florida secretary of state who defines the term 'preeningly self- important' as she steamrollered the process that saw Bush victorious. Although the result is history, the film grippingly recreates the tensions of those days when, just for a moment, it looked like a Democrat would be elected President. UK network premiere. Showing as part of More4's US Election Season. Premiere(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Finding John Christmas</title>
    <desc lang="en">First telecast by CBS on November 30, 2003, the made-for-TV Finding John Christmas is a sequel to the previous year's A Town Without Christmas, with Peter Falk reprising his role as versatile guardian angel Max. Valerie Bertinelli plays Kathleen McAllister, a divorced small-town nurse whose depression over the fact that the hospital ER she maintains may be forced to shut down because of a $100,000 debt is briefly lifted when she spots a newspaper picture taken by photojournalist Noah Greeley (David Cubitt). The picture shows an act of bravery performed by Noah's firefighter brother Hank (William Russ), who mysteriously left town 25 years ago and hasn't been seen since. Hank would like to quietly slip back into town without explanation or fanfare, but this proves impossible when Noah's newspaper posts a $50,000 reward to identify Hank, known only to the public as "John Christmas." And there's something, very, very curious about that photo: It also shows a Santa Claus suit seemingly floating in midair without an occupant. That elusive "Santa" is of course the angelic Max, who pops up now and again throughout the story in a variety of guises to solve problems, dispense advice, tie up loose plot strands--and even share a musical duet with Kathleen's talented daughter Socorro (Jennifer Pisana)(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Next Nostradamus</title>
    <desc lang="en">Many are overly familiar with the eerily prescient foretellings of 16th Century French prophet Michel de Nostradame, (1503-66). But few may realize that an early 21st century equivalent of Nostradamus began making prophecies comparable to those of the Middle Ages' most prominent seer - with the aid of a computer -in the late 1980s. Dr. Bueno de Mesquita's prophecies (unlike Nostradame's) were concrete enough that they actually enabled observers to predict events before those events occurred, including the second Intifada and the crackdown at Tianamen Square by the Chinese government. Then, de Mesquita emerged with a host of much darker and more foreboding prophecies including famine, World War III, and the arrival of the Antichrist. This documentary from The History Channel profiles de Mesquita and draws striking parallels between his work and that of Nostradamus, and raises key questions about what might lie ahead for humanity based on the conclusions of de Mesquita's work(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Get Carter</title>
    <desc lang="en">A man who has made murder his business is thrown into the underbelly of an unfamiliar criminal world in this thriller. Jack Carter (Sylvester Stallone) is a ruthless hired killer whose bloody career in Los Angeles has driven a wedge between himself and his family in the Northwest. When he learns that his brother has died, he flies back to Seattle, hoping to pay his respects and reconnect with his relatives. At the funeral, his brother's wife, Gloria (Miranda Richardson), and her daughter, Doreen (Rachael Leigh Cook), are wary of Jack's attempts to reach out to them, but when he learns that his brother's death was no accident, Jack forms an uneasy alliance with Doreen to find the killers and deal out his own brand of justice. Get Carter is based on the novel Jack's Return Home by Ted Lewis, which was previously filmed in 1971 with Michael Caine as the gangster seeking revenge. Caine also appears in this remake as Cliff, the boss of Jack's late brother; Mickey Rourke, Alan Cumming, and Gretchen Mol also highlight the supporting cast(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Get Carter</title>
    <desc lang="en">A man who has made murder his business is thrown into the underbelly of an unfamiliar criminal world in this thriller. Jack Carter (Sylvester Stallone) is a ruthless hired killer whose bloody career in Los Angeles has driven a wedge between himself and his family in the Northwest. When he learns that his brother has died, he flies back to Seattle, hoping to pay his respects and reconnect with his relatives. At the funeral, his brother's wife, Gloria (Miranda Richardson), and her daughter, Doreen (Rachael Leigh Cook), are wary of Jack's attempts to reach out to them, but when he learns that his brother's death was no accident, Jack forms an uneasy alliance with Doreen to find the killers and deal out his own brand of justice. Get Carter is based on the novel Jack's Return Home by Ted Lewis, which was previously filmed in 1971 with Michael Caine as the gangster seeking revenge. Caine also appears in this remake as Cliff, the boss of Jack's late brother; Mickey Rourke, Alan Cumming, and Gretchen Mol also highlight the supporting cast(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A team of highly motivated scientists led by National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence Enric Sala sets out on a treacherous journey to the Pitcairn Islands, a remote archipelago in the Pacific Ocean, to document the environment both in the sea and on land with hopes of turning this potentially pristine ocean environment into a protected marine reserve. For thirty days and thirty nights, hundreds of miles from anywhere, Sala's expedition will tackle the mysteries of the Pitcairns head on, hitting all four islands in the chain. Not much is known about the islands and each tells a unique story. Following in the same vein as his previous odysseys (and films), Enric Sala leads the charge on yet another groundbreaking expedition to document what healthy reefs should look like and explore what could be one of the last pristine ocean locations on earth. This is exploration at its most extreme and isolated. And in this remote corner of the planet, the stakes are high(n)</desc>

Despite the overwhelming evidence against Mr. Krabs -- not to mention having been turned down for a long-awaited promotion at the restaurant -- SpongeBob (voice of Tom Kenny) refuses to believe that his boss is responsible and teams up with his best friend, Patrick (voice of Bill Fagerbakke), on a mission to Shell City, where he hopes he can exonerate Mr. Krabs and return the crown to its rightful owner. Of course, this is no easy task; once outside the safety of Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob is faced with the overwhelming dangers of the sea, not the least of which being a cyclops that many believe to be responsible for the deaths of countless other unfortunate sea-creatures who ventured outside county lines. Among those who lent their vocal chords to the film include Scarlett Johansson, Jeffrey Tambor, and Alec Baldwin(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The One with the Prom Video. Episode 38 is memorable for the video of Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) and Monica (Courteney Cox) preparing for their senior prom. Featuring a pre-nose surgery Rachel, an overweight Monica -- in an awful poofy, red dress -- and Ross (David Schwimmer) sporting a moustache and curly hair combo that would even make Gabe Kaplan wince, this is funny stuff. Ross makes a list about Rachel's attributes that angers her, causing her to swear that they will never get together as a couple. Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) tries to console Ross with her theory that Rachel is his lobster and therefore they are meant for each other. She says, "You can actually see old lobster couples walking around their tank, you know, holding claws like...." The video shows up in some things Monica's parents bring over because they are renovating her room into a gym. In the video, Rachel is stood up by her date and Ross' dad privately urges him to put on a tux and accompany her to the prom. Ross, clearly enamored with Rachel, fights his insecurity and agrees to do it. As Ross comes beaming down the stairs, Rachel's date shows up and a defeated Ross escapes to his room. Seeing Ross' chivalrous compassion for the first time, Rachel immediately forgives him for making his list and kisses him. Of course, the real joy is watching the video that allows Chandler (Matthew Perry) and Joey (Matt LeBlanc) to get off some juicy one-liners about how nerdy everyone looks. There is also great subplot involving a garish gold bracelet that Joey -- now earning money -- gives to Chandler. This episode originally aired on February 1, 1996(n)</desc>

Despite the overwhelming evidence against Mr. Krabs -- not to mention having been turned down for a long-awaited promotion at the restaurant -- SpongeBob (voice of Tom Kenny) refuses to believe that his boss is responsible and teams up with his best friend, Patrick (voice of Bill Fagerbakke), on a mission to Shell City, where he hopes he can exonerate Mr. Krabs and return the crown to its rightful owner. Of course, this is no easy task; once outside the safety of Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob is faced with the overwhelming dangers of the sea, not the least of which being a cyclops that many believe to be responsible for the deaths of countless other unfortunate sea-creatures who ventured outside county lines.

    <desc lang="en">Documentary examining the plants and animals that thrive in monsoon areas, narrated by Colin Salmon. Crested black macaques take advantage of an abundance of fruit, and maleo birds use the sun to incubate their eggs on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. On Java, locals climb volcanoes to offer live sacrifices in thanks for the peaks' help in precipitating rain and fertilising plants with ash. The frequent and heavy rains in Borneo have destroyed the soils, created fierce competition for scarce nutrients, and driven evolution to produce some curious creatures. The Rajah Brooke's pitcher encourages tree shrews to relieve themselves to obtain the substances it needs, while the Bornean red leech is capable of swallowing the giant blue earthworm in one gulp.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This documentary about the aspirations of high-school basketball players from inner city Chicago won awards from the Sundance film festival, the New York Film Critics Circle, and the Academy Award (Oscar) for best editing. Two young men are followed during their entire high-school career, beginning with their participation in playground games and ending with their being recruited by colleges. The obstacles these young men face include parental drug addiction, family poverty, and inner-city violence, as well as the usual obstacles that arise in competition, including physical injuries. While each aspires to leave the ghetto, there are many reasons to suppose they may not be able to, despite each beating the odds against them by winning college scholarships(n)</desc>

Feeling no small degree of culture shock in Japan, Bob spends most of his non-working hours at his hotel, where he meets Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) at the bar.

Shortly after earning his degree, Paul Dynan (Kevin Zegers) realizes the certificate in his hand is barely worth the paper it's printed on. Subsequently drowning in a sea of debt due to his student loans and his mother's medical bills, the disillusioned graduate hits a breaking point as the bank prepares to foreclose on his family home, and devises a plan to earn some quick cash while giving the rich a lesson in humility. His plan: abduct three privileged socialites with the help of two young deviants, and make their fathers (Ray Liotta, Victor Garber), and Stephen McHattie) fork over $3 million for their safe return. Unfortunately for Paul, the bitter infighting between his three affluent targets is about to blow the plan sky high, and offer a painful lesson in the perils of crime(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Bats</title>
    <desc lang="en">Beware of what goes "bump" (and "squeak" and "flap flap flap") in the night. Dr. Sheila Casper (Dina Meyer) is a respected zoologist dispatched by the government to Gallup, TX, a small community suffering from an unusual number of reported bat attacks. Casper finds this news puzzling, since bats are generally placid creatures who avoid contact with humans. The local sheriff, Emmett Kimsey (Lou Diamond Phillips), assures Casper that the reports are on the level and that something needs to be done about swarms of aggressive bats so thick they blot out the moon. Caspar and Kimsey discover that a new breed of genetically altered bats have escaped from a research facility and taken up residence in a cave near Gallup -- but the nocturnal bloodsuckers have no intention of leaving as quickly as they arrived. Bats was written by John Logan, who had two other projects hit the screen within a few months of Bats' release: Oliver Stone's Any Given Sunday and Ridley Scott's Gladiator. The supporting cast includes Leon and Bob Gunton(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Bats</title>
    <desc lang="en">Beware of what goes "bump" (and "squeak" and "flap flap flap") in the night. Dr. Sheila Casper (Dina Meyer) is a respected zoologist dispatched by the government to Gallup, TX, a small community suffering from an unusual number of reported bat attacks. Casper finds this news puzzling, since bats are generally placid creatures who avoid contact with humans. The local sheriff, Emmett Kimsey (Lou Diamond Phillips), assures Casper that the reports are on the level and that something needs to be done about swarms of aggressive bats so thick they blot out the moon. Caspar and Kimsey discover that a new breed of genetically altered bats have escaped from a research facility and taken up residence in a cave near Gallup -- but the nocturnal bloodsuckers have no intention of leaving as quickly as they arrived. Bats was written by John Logan, who had two other projects hit the screen within a few months of Bats' release: Oliver Stone's Any Given Sunday and Ridley Scott's Gladiator. The supporting cast includes Leon and Bob Gunton(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A thirtysomething single mother whose boundless potential was squandered through a series of failed relationships and a misguided effort to help her younger sister succeed in life finds the fruits of her labors finally coming together in director Christine Jeffs' dark family comedy. Back in high school, the future looked pretty bright for Rose Lorkowski (Amy Adams); not only was she the cheerleading captain, but she was also dating the star quarterback. Flash forward a little over a decade, and Rose is working overtime in hopes of getting her son into a better school. Her sister, Norah (Emily Blunt), is still living at home with their father, Joe (Alan Arkin), a failed salesman whose penchant for jumping into get-rich-quick schemes has left the family without a financial net to fall back on. Rose may be down, but she certainly isn't out, and when she hatches a plan to launch a crime-scene cleanup business, the money starts rolling in. Sure, cleaning up murder scenes and suicide sites may not be the most glamorous job in the world, but death is a fairly profitable business, and as the phone keeps ringing, Rose and Norah finally begin to experience the closeness of sisterhood that has eluded them all these years while also providing their family with true security(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Searching for Sugar Man</title>
    <desc lang="en">Two South African music lovers embark on a mission to uncover the fate of an obscure, 1970s-era U.S. rocker whose debut album became a surprise hit in their home country, and uncover a shocking secret along the way. Sixto Diaz Rodriguez had the kind of musical career that every aspiring rock star fears -- lauded by critics but ignored by the public, he released two albums before unceremoniously disappearing from the spotlight. But while sales of Rodriguez's debut CD Cold Fact fell flat in the U.S., overseas in Australia and South Africa, the fans couldn't get enough. In apartheid-torn South Africa in particular, Cold Fact became something of an anti-establishment classic, eventually going platinum. Later, rumors began to swirl that Rodriguez had suffered a horrible death. When Rodriguez's second album Coming From Reality makes it's belated debut in South Africa, a pair of devoted fans take it upon themselves to uncover the facts surrounding the mysterious musician, and get the surprise of a lifetime while attempting to track the profits from his record sales(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">No Such Thing</title>
    <desc lang="en">Beauty meets the Beast, and neither is sure just what to make of the other, in a modern-dress comic variation on the ancient folk tale, written and directed by the eternally offbeat Hal Hartley. Beatrice (Sarah Polley) works with the office staff of a sleazy tabloid TV news show, run by a harridan producer (Helen Mirren) eager for something other than the usual spate of violent crimes and natural disasters that are her show's bread and butter. The producer sends her camera crew to Iceland in search of something new and unusual, and they certainly find it when they run across a village that has its own monster (Robert John Burke), a large part-mammal and part-lizard with a short temper and habit of killing people who get on his nerves. The show's camera crew (including Beatrice's boyfriend) doesn't survive their first encounter with the monster, and Beatrice is sent to find out what happened to them. En route to Iceland, Beatrice's plane crashes into the waters off the coast, and while she survives the accident, a group of unsympathetic locals decide (after a few drinks too many) to take her to the monster's lair, where a grim fate doubtless awaits her. Except that the monster is a bit depressed and Beatrice isn't in the mood to take any guff from anyone; after the monster wonders aloud why folks aren't as frightened of him as they once were, he asks Beatrice to help him find Dr. Artaud (Baltasar Kormakur), a mad scientist who might be able to cure him of the curse of eternal life. No Such Thing received its world premiere at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival, where it was screened as part of the Un Certain Regard series(n)</desc>

Adams is also dealing with some emotional problems of his own after the death of his wife and child. Parker (John C. McGinley), a documentary filmmaker, has arrived at the hospital where Adams works to make a movie about his work, just in time for Adams to start working with a new patient -- a mysterious and angry fellow known only as "The Man" -- who insists he is Satan (Eriq LaSalle). The new patient is not easily convinced that he's delusional, and as he becomes a greater disruptive force, Adams can't help but wonder if maybe the stranger is telling the truth. Crazy as Hell was directed by actor Eriq LaSalle, who plays the new patient and is best known for his work on the television series E.R.; it was his first theatrical feature, after helming the made-for-cable Rebound(n)</desc>

However, they are under threat; can he help them survive? Kurt Wimmer's sci-fi film, like Fahrenheit 451, concentrates primarily on raising moral and ethical issues, although there are also spectacular Gun-Kata fights, where special techniques allow combatants to anticipate the path of bullets and avoid them. Contains violence. M,W,R,S(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Winning is everything, even if you have to lie, and cheat to do it. That is the under-lying message of this dramatic expose of college basketball recruiters. Up till recently, Pete Bell has been a winning coach for Western U's basketball team. But this year has been different. The film opens with the coach ripping into the team for another dreadful game. Bell knows that if his team continues to lose, he will lose his job. He has no choice but to recruit more talent. He begins his search for better players and finds three good prospects: Chicago player Butch Hardaway, an accurate shooter; Ricky, an enormously tall boy form French Lick, Indiana; and Neon, a temperamental giant. Together these three offer unbeatable potential if he can get them to come to Western. But it's not easy. The first two make exorbitant demands involving a lot of cash, new homes, and farm equipment. Neon asks for nothing but gets a new luxury car. Coach Pete is already dealing with allegations of shadiness and does not want to give in, but he is forced to by the alumni organization leader. Pete does not cope well(n)</desc>

Upon discovering that his business partner Jimbo Cobb (Buddy Ebsen) possesses psychokinetic powers enabling him to move things with his brain power alone, café owner and compulsive gambler Ace Larsen (Dane Clark) hightails it to Las Vegas with Jimbo in tow. It is Ace's contention that Jimbo's unsual gift will enable him to "fix" dice games and roulette wheels without detection, and for a while this proves to be the case. But what Ace hasn't counted on is the fact that Jimbo has a conscience -- and that Jimbo is disgusted by Ace's cavalier treatment of his erstwhile girlfriend Kitty Cavanaugh (Christine White). Scripted by Charles Beaumont from a story by George Clayton Johnson, "The Prime Mover" made its Twilight Zone debut on March 24, 1961(n)</desc>
