    <title lang="en">Definitely, Maybe</title>
    <desc lang="en">A political consultant in the midst of a bitter divorce attempts to delicately divulge the truth about his past relationships to his curious young daughter, who simply won't stop asking questions until she's satisfied with all the answers. Ten-year-old Maya (Abigail Breslin) is heartbroken to see her parents splitting up, but she's determined to find out precisely how it was that mom and dad came together in the first place. When Maya starts questioning her father Will (Ryan Reynolds) about his life before marriage, dad's memories soon drift back to the time when, as a naïve Wisconsin native and aspiring politician hoping to work on the presidential election, he first arrived in New York City. As Will gradually became savvy to the ways of the big city, he gradually developed romantic relationships with three very different women: Emily (Elizabeth Banks) was the girl-next-door that he could always depend on, apolitical April (Isla Fisher) was the best friend and confidante who was always there to listen, and free-spirited journalist Summer (Rachel Weisz) was both beautiful and ambitious. In order to prevent his perceptive little girl from predicting the outcome before his story is told, Will carefully changes the names of his three romantic interests, creating a hopelessly romantic puzzle that highlights both the joys and hardships of true love(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Mean Streets</title>
    <desc lang="en">Mean Streets is the film which cemented the reputation of director Martin Scorsese, launching him to the forefront of American filmmaking. His third feature, this oft-imitated effort establishes many of Scorsese's thematic and stylistic trademarks, including his use of "outsider" heroes, unusual camera and editing techniques, a preoccupation with gangster life, an ongoing fascination with religion and the evocative use of popular music on the movie's soundtrack. Based on Scorsese's own experiences growing up in New York's Little Italy section, the film stars Harvey Keitel as Charlie, the nephew of a local mob boss (Cesare Danova); a deeply religious young man who models his life on the teachings of St. Francis of Assisi, Charlie takes on a reclamation project in the form of Johnny Boy (Robert DeNiro), a young tough whose violent, irrational behavior has landed him in trouble with the local crime lords. Charlie is determined to "save" both Johnny Boy and his epileptic sister Teresa (Amy Robinson) in order to achieve sainthood, but Johnny Boy, a powderkeg waiting to explode, may be beyond salvation(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Five expectant couples learn that having a baby is anything but predictable in this uplifting romantic comedy based on Heidi Murkoff's ubiquitous best-seller. A household name thanks to her popular fitness show, Jules (Cameron Diaz) can't contain her excitement after learning she is about to have a baby with Evan (Matthew J. Morrison), the sure-footed star of a popular dance show. But the closer Jules gets to her due date, the more she and Evan realize the demands of parenthood and the responsibilities of a celebrity couldn't be more different. Meanwhile, outspoken infant-advice author Wendy (Elizabeth Banks) contends with surging hormones as her belly begins to swell, and her devoted husband Gary is shell-shocked to discover that his overbearing trophy wife will soon be having twins. Of course not everyone is cut out to be a father, and as professional photographer Holly (Jennifer Lopez) prepares to scour the globe for a child to adopt, her reluctant husband Alex gets his first glimpse of fatherhood in a brutally honest support group for new dads. And while some parents spend years preparing for the right moment to have a child, feuding food-truck owners Rosie (Anna Kendrick) and Marco (Chace Crawford) get the surprise of their lives when an impulsive act of passion has permanent repercussions(n)</desc>

Cher (Alicia Silverstone) and Dionne (Stacey Dash), both named after "great singers of the past that now do infomercials," are pampered upper-class girls who care less about getting good grades than wearing the right clothes and being as popular as possible. But Cher, who lives with her tough yet warm-hearted lawyer dad (Dan Hedaya) and hunky, sensitive stepbrother (Paul Rudd), also has an innate urge to help those less fortunate -- like the two introverted teachers she brings together ("negotiating" herself improved grades in the process) and new friend Tai (Brittany Murphy), who starts out a geek and ends up a Cher prodigy. Cher also possesses her own sensitive side, and she is looking for the perfect boyfriend, whom she ends up finding where she least expected(n)</desc>

Hunnicut (Mike Farrell), the likeable replacement of Hawkeye's old pal Trapper John, back to the 4077th. En route, B.J. gets his first taste of "surgery under fire"--and Hawkeye realizes that he's found a kindred spirit. Imagine the surprise of strutting martinet Frank Burns (Larry Linville) when the "strait-laced" B.J. turns out to be just as cheeky and irreverent as Hawkeye; clearly, it's going to be business as usual for the rest of the War. The first of the series' 60-minute "special" episodes, Welcome to Korea has since been divided into two half-hour episodes for syndication(n)</desc>

Their success meant they could afford to purchase the location next door in the 1990s, naming it Mama Maria after John's mother, who died in 2002. But when he lost his father as well, John became overwhelmed by the responsibility of running both establishments and his livelihood is at risk.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Sinkholes: Buried Alive</title>
    <desc lang="en">An investigation into sinkholes, a natural phenomenon that sees the ground give away as a result of weak acid attacking the rocks below, riddling them with holes like Swiss cheese. They can occur gradually, when the surface subsides into bowl-shaped depressions, or suddenly, when the ground gives away - swallowing animals, buildings and even entire highways. This documentary features video footage of dramatic collapses and follows scientists as they explore the underlying forces behind these natural disasters.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Ghost World</title>
    <desc lang="en">Filmmaker Terry Zwigoff, who enjoyed breakthrough success with his 1994 documentary Crumb, shifts gears as he examines the lives of two young women on the verge of leaving their adolescence behind in his first dramatic feature. Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) are two close friends who've just graduated from high school, and are trying to decide what to do with their lives. Enid is a dark-haired arch cynic who is tired of living at home with her ineffectual dad (Bob Balaban) and his annoyingly perky girlfriend Maxine (Teri Garr), while Rebecca is prettier and a bit cheerier, but no more certain about her future. While the two girls have vague plans of getting an apartment together, they seem content to while away their summer hanging out and indulging in their shared infatuation with Josh (Brad Renfro), a friend from school who works at a convenience store and doesn't seem to be especially attracted to either of them. Enid discovers that in order to get her diploma, she'll have to take an additional class over the summer, where she winds up studying art with Roberta (Illeana Douglas), who is determined to encourage Enid's creative impulses, whether Enid likes it or not. More significantly, Enid meets Seymour (Steve Buscemi), a geeky record collector more than twice her age, and while they would seem to have little in common (and Rebecca thinks he's a creep), Enid discovers a kindred spirit in fellow misfit Seymour, who shares her disgust with the world around them, and a relationship begins to develop between the two. Ghost World is based on the award-winning graphic novel by comic artist Daniel Clowes, who also wrote the film's screenplay(n)</desc>

A sweet-toothed chimpanzee uses a complex array of tools to access honey from a beehive, the elusive picathartes bird feeds unsuspecting frogs to its dinosaur-like chicks and a massive female python reveals her maternal side as she sunbathes to incubate her eggs. Tiny leaf-folding frogs battle it out kung fu style, and as darkness falls the forest elephants gather to face their rivals.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">When Frank Sinatra sang "If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere, it's up to you, New York!" he probably didn't have the same odds in mind that line up against Henry and Nancy Clark in The Out-Of-Towners. Henry (Steve Martin) is an advertising man from Ohio who runs his life on an exacting schedule. His wife Nancy (Goldie Hawn) feels the spark has gone out of their lives together. After 24 years of marriage, their children are grown and nothing is tying them to their old home, so they decide to take a stab at relocating to New York City. Henry arranges a job interview in the Big Apple, they schedule a flight into Manhattan, and from that point on, anything that can go wrong does go wrong. Henry and Nancy's flight is delayed, their luggage is lost, their hotel reservations are cancelled, they're accosted by muggers, the cab they're riding in gets in a wreck, Henry is accidentally drugged and Nancy ends up in a group therapy meeting for sex addicts. The Out-Of-Towners is an updated remake of the 1970 comedy scripted by Neil Simon; the original version starred Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis as the hapless Midwesterners(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Wolverine</title>
    <desc lang="en">A haunted Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) journeys to Japan to bid an old friend farewell, and gets drawn into a conflict involving ninja and yakuza in stand-alone spin-off set following the events of X-Men: The Last Stand, and preceding the events of X-Men: Days of Future Past. The story begins in Nagasaki. As a B-29 bomber appears in the sky and air-raid sirens howl, panicked Japanese troops begin committing ritual seppuku. Terrified, yet unwilling to sacrifice his own life, young soldier Yashida takes cover in a heavily fortified prison pit containing the immortal mutant Wolverine, who shields him from a deadly blast. Decades later, Wolverine has sworn off violence after he was forced to kill his beloved Jean Grey (Famke Janssen). He's confronting a hunter who has been using illegal, poison-tipped arrows when the sword-wielding Yukio (Rila Fukushima) comes to his aid, and summons him to Japan at the behest of the dying Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi), now the head of Japan's largest and most powerful tech giant. Just hours before passing away, Yashida implores Wolverine to protect his granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamato), whom he has personally chosen to take over the family business -- much to the chagrin of her plotting father Shingen (Hiroyuki Sanada). When the yakuza attempt a high-profile kidnapping of Mariko during Yashida's funeral, Wolverine comes to her rescue, and receives some much needed help from enigmatic ninja Harada (Will Yun Lee). Narrowly escaping with their lives, Wolverine and Mariko go into hiding with the yakuza and ruthless mutant Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) hot on their trail. But the battle is far from over, and with Wolverine's healing powers mysteriously diminished, he may not be able to protect Mariko for long(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Set amidst the burgeoning Seattle alternative music scene of the early '90s, Singles follows a group of twentysomethings as they try to find love and try to come to terms with their passage into adulthood. Arranged as an episodic comedy, the film follows a group of friends who live in the same apartment building and hang out at the same coffee shop. The central couple is Steve Dunne (Campbell Scott) and Linda Powell (Kyra Sedgwick), a pair who meet at an Alice In Chains concert and eventually fall in love. Singles follows the tumultuous relationship between Steve and Linda and their friendship with Janet Livermore (Bridget Fonda), who is trying to win the affection of grunge-rocker Cliff Poncier (Matt Dillon). The film also has a number of cameos, including actors Eric Stoltz, Tom Skerritt, Peter Horton, director Tim Burton and the film's author/director, Cameron Crowe. From the musical side of the fence, Singles features appearances by Sub Pop executive Bruce Pavitt, musicians Chris Cornell (Soundgarden), Pat DiNizio (Smithereens), Tad (Tad), and Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder, Jeff Ament, and Stone Gossard, who play Dillon's backing band, Citizen Dick(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This cheerful holiday comedy, a surprise box office smash, featured a generous dollop of raunchy, crude humor and was greatly elevated by the presence of masterful performers in the lead roles. Jack Lemmon is John Gustafson, an ice-fishing Minnesota native who has been feuding with his neighbor and former best friend Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) for decades. The battle of wills between John and Max is characterized by crude name calling and harmless practical jokes. Max is unaware that John is having serious problems, chiefly that his daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah) is experiencing marital woes and that his house is about to be confiscated by an officious IRS agent (Buck Henry). When it seems that John and Max may finally put aside their childish rivalry, however, sexy new neighbor Ariel (Ann-Margret) arrives and dates both men, pitting them against each other more fiercely than ever before. Despite their mutual loathing, the death of a friend, John's problems, and a budding romance between Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) and Melanie may force the two old friends to reconcile(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Village</title>
    <desc lang="en">M. Night Shyamalan, the creative mind behind The Sixth Sense and Signs, wrote and directed this characteristically atmospheric thriller. The rustic village of Covington is a small town in rural Pennsylvania that is home to 60 souls. The citizens of Covington lead a quiet and peaceful life, but not without an unusual caveat -- terrible creatures lurk just outside the borders of the village, and the people of Covington have reached an agreement of sorts with the beasts, in which they are allowed to go about their business as long as they never cross the village's boundaries. However, this precarious balance is upset when a headstrong young man, Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix), decides to find out what lies outside Covington, and unwittingly invites the wrath of the creatures upon the town. The Village also stars Sigourney Weaver, William Hurt, Adrien Brody, Judy Greer, and Bryce Dallas Howard; both Kirsten Dunst and Ashton Kutcher were at one time attached to the project, but both left the cast before filming began(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Set amidst the burgeoning Seattle alternative music scene of the early '90s, Singles follows a group of twentysomethings as they try to find love and try to come to terms with their passage into adulthood. Arranged as an episodic comedy, the film follows a group of friends who live in the same apartment building and hang out at the same coffee shop. The central couple is Steve Dunne (Campbell Scott) and Linda Powell (Kyra Sedgwick), a pair who meet at an Alice In Chains concert and eventually fall in love. Singles follows the tumultuous relationship between Steve and Linda and their friendship with Janet Livermore (Bridget Fonda), who is trying to win the affection of grunge-rocker Cliff Poncier (Matt Dillon). The film also has a number of cameos, including actors Eric Stoltz, Tom Skerritt, Peter Horton, director Tim Burton and the film's author/director, Cameron Crowe. From the musical side of the fence, Singles features appearances by Sub Pop executive Bruce Pavitt, musicians Chris Cornell (Soundgarden), Pat DiNizio (Smithereens), Tad (Tad), and Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder, Jeff Ament, and Stone Gossard, who play Dillon's backing band, Citizen Dick(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This cheerful holiday comedy, a surprise box office smash, featured a generous dollop of raunchy, crude humor and was greatly elevated by the presence of masterful performers in the lead roles. Jack Lemmon is John Gustafson, an ice-fishing Minnesota native who has been feuding with his neighbor and former best friend Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) for decades. The battle of wills between John and Max is characterized by crude name calling and harmless practical jokes. Max is unaware that John is having serious problems, chiefly that his daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah) is experiencing marital woes and that his house is about to be confiscated by an officious IRS agent (Buck Henry). When it seems that John and Max may finally put aside their childish rivalry, however, sexy new neighbor Ariel (Ann-Margret) arrives and dates both men, pitting them against each other more fiercely than ever before. Despite their mutual loathing, the death of a friend, John's problems, and a budding romance between Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) and Melanie may force the two old friends to reconcile(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Village</title>
    <desc lang="en">M. Night Shyamalan, the creative mind behind The Sixth Sense and Signs, wrote and directed this characteristically atmospheric thriller. The rustic village of Covington is a small town in rural Pennsylvania that is home to 60 souls. The citizens of Covington lead a quiet and peaceful life, but not without an unusual caveat -- terrible creatures lurk just outside the borders of the village, and the people of Covington have reached an agreement of sorts with the beasts, in which they are allowed to go about their business as long as they never cross the village's boundaries. However, this precarious balance is upset when a headstrong young man, Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix), decides to find out what lies outside Covington, and unwittingly invites the wrath of the creatures upon the town. The Village also stars Sigourney Weaver, William Hurt, Adrien Brody, Judy Greer, and Bryce Dallas Howard; both Kirsten Dunst and Ashton Kutcher were at one time attached to the project, but both left the cast before filming began(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In this science fiction thriller, child psychiatrist Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) has developed a technique that allows her to travel through the minds of her patients. When Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio), a multiple murderer who methodically drowns his victims and performs bizarre rituals with their bodies, falls into a coma, FBI agent Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) asks Deane to enter the killer's psyche, in the hope of finding a missing girl whom Stargher has kidnapped; if she's not soon found, in all likelihood she'll die in his torture cell. However, once Deane enters the bizarre world of Stargher's mind, she finds getting out to be a very difficult matter. The Cell was the first feature from director Tarsem, who previously made award-winning commercials and music videos, including the video for R.E.M.'s "Losing My Religion."

    <title lang="en">The Cell</title>
    <desc lang="en">In this science fiction thriller, child psychiatrist Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) has developed a technique that allows her to travel through the minds of her patients. When Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio), a multiple murderer who methodically drowns his victims and performs bizarre rituals with their bodies, falls into a coma, FBI agent Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) asks Deane to enter the killer's psyche, in the hope of finding a missing girl whom Stargher has kidnapped; if she's not soon found, in all likelihood she'll die in his torture cell. However, once Deane enters the bizarre world of Stargher's mind, she finds getting out to be a very difficult matter. The Cell was the first feature from director Tarsem, who previously made award-winning commercials and music videos, including the video for R.E.M.'s "Losing My Religion." The supporting cast includes Catherine Sutherland, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Dylan Baker, and Pruitt Taylor Vince(n)</desc>

Bruce Willis stars as child psychologist Dr Malcolm Crowe, who is asked to help Cole Sear, who claims he can 'see dead people'. Crowe is sceptical at first, but he's gradually convinced that the boy is telling the truth. Crowe believes that actively engaging with the ghostly presences could help both Sear and the spirits to find peace. Overcoming his terror, the lad finds that communicating with the deceased does, at first, seem to be beneficial. But then matters take on their own momentum, leading to one of the director's trademark plot twists..(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A political consultant in the midst of a bitter divorce attempts to delicately divulge the truth about his past relationships to his curious young daughter, who simply won't stop asking questions until she's satisfied with all the answers. Ten-year-old Maya (Abigail Breslin) is heartbroken to see her parents splitting up, but she's determined to find out precisely how it was that mom and dad came together in the first place. When Maya starts questioning her father Will (Ryan Reynolds) about his life before marriage, dad's memories soon drift back to the time when, as a naïve Wisconsin native and aspiring politician hoping to work on the presidential election, he first arrived in New York City. As Will gradually became savvy to the ways of the big city, he gradually developed romantic relationships with three very different women: Emily (Elizabeth Banks) was the girl-next-door that he could always depend on, apolitical April (Isla Fisher) was the best friend and confidante who was always there to listen, and free-spirited journalist Summer (Rachel Weisz) was both beautiful and ambitious. In order to prevent his perceptive little girl from predicting the outcome before his story is told, Will carefully changes the names of his three romantic interests, creating a hopelessly romantic puzzle that highlights both the joys and hardships of true love(n)</desc>

Determined to work through the problem, Hal opts for an extreme route -- he joins the school debating team, which sends him on a headfirst plunge into breakneck speech competitions -- and offers a much-needed boost toward correcting the problem. Blitz, like his onscreen alter ego, struggled with a stammer as a young man -- a disability he eventually surmounted -- which imparted him with a lifelong interest in speech and storytelling(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Racing Stripes</title>
    <desc lang="en">A horse of a different pattern becomes a spoiler in a high-stakes race in the family-friendly comedy-drama. Nolan Walsh (Bruce Greenwood) is a farmer who once earned his living training racehorses before his wife was killed in an accident while riding, which led him to leave the racing game. Nolan tends to his farm and looks after his daughter Channing (Hayden Panettiere) and a large flock of animals, who speak to one another but not to humans. After a traveling circus passes through town, a zebra pony is left behind; Nolan takes in the animal, intending to return it to the circus, but at Channing's insistence they keep the zebra, naming him Stripes (voiced by Frankie Muniz). Channing loves Stripes, and the zebra is welcomed by the other critters on the farm, including grumpy Shetland pony Tucker (voiced by Dustin Hoffman), slow-moving hound dog Lightning (voiced by Snoop Dogg), a New Jersey-born pelican named Goose (voiced by Joe Pantoliano), skinny-brained rooster Reggie (voiced by Jeff Foxworthy), and deep-thinking goat Franny (voiced by Whoopi Goldberg). Channing discovers that Stripes can outrun nearly any horse around, and Woodzie (M. Emmett Walsh), a local character who has spent years handicapping the ponies, is convinced the zebra would be shoo-in in the Kentucky Open, a prestigious race held at the estate of champion horse breeder Clara Dalrymple (Wendie Malick). Channing believes Stripes can win, but he'll need the help of Nolan, who isn't so sure he's ready to start training again; meanwhile, Stripes gets plenty of advice from the other farm animals about his big step onto the race track. Mandy Moore, David Spade, and Steve Harvey also contribute their voice talents to the picture(n)</desc>

Mia Thermopolis (Anne Hathaway) is a teenage klutz who's openly mocked by the popular Lana Thomas (pop singer Mandy Moore). In fact, Mia's only friend at her exclusive prep school is the socially outcast Lilly (Heather Matarazzo). Mia's life takes a dramatic turn, however, when her mom announces that her late biological father was in actuality the crown prince of a small European nation, Genovia. Now Mia is the sole heir to the throne, and her grandmother, Queen Clarisse Renaldi (Julie Andrews) wants to tutor the awkward teen in royal behavior. It's a daunting task given Mia's lax table manners, poise, and hair care, but the girl perseveres with some makeover help from her grandmother's security chief Hector Elizondo) and a style expert (Larry Miller). In the meantime, Mia's romantic affections are torn between the handsome, popular Josh (Erik Von Detten) and the more appropriate Michael (Robert Schwartzman), who also happens to be Lilly's brother. The Princess Diaries is the second film from Whitney Houston's production shingle after the television version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella (1997)(n)</desc>

Scientists Lindsay Crouse and Timothy Hutton hope to learn to communicate with the Iceman, and in so doing discover what life was truly like for our Neanderthal ancestors. But other, less altruistic scientists want to dissect him and analyze his innards. With Hutton's help, the Iceman escapes, but soon both men realize that there's really no place for the ancient warrior in modern society.

    <title lang="en">AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem</title>
    <desc lang="en">Visual effects specialists Greg and Colin Strause both make their feature directorial debut with this no-holds-barred monster mash that attempts to set itself apart from the 2004 Paul W.S. Anderson original by serving as a straight-up sci-fi horror scarefest. The aliens (and a predator) have landed on planet Earth, and small-town America is about to become the scene of an epic interstellar showdown. As these two breeds of cosmic killers clash in the small-town streets Gunnison, CO, the locals are sent running for their lives. From the murky sewers to the rain-soaked streets, Gunnison has become a total bloodbath. Nowhere is safe, especially from the unstoppable new hybrid known as the "predalien." Now, as the once-quiet community of Gunnison is overrun by Aliens, the only hope for humankind is a fierce hunter from the deepest reaches of space. But this predator is far from a benevolent savior of the human race, because he'll kill any man, woman, or child who gets in the way of his mission to destroy every last alien under these stormy Colorado skies(n)</desc>

Yet in truth, the Earth's deserts (which make up 40% of the land) began to undergo dramatic shifts in the mid-20th century, exemplified by the transformation of Las Vegas into a multi-billion-dollar resort community with the hydroelectric power of the Hoover Dam nearby, and also the engineering of barren areas of California into lush land suitable for cultivation. As produced by The History Channel, this documentary program examines such advancements in detail, and speculates on what may lie ahead in this realm, such as the desert technology-fueled colonization of Mars(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">It's often said that the true character of a man is only revealed in times of dire crisis, and for likable, lovelorn loser Shaun (Simon Pegg), that moment of reckoning came when the dead rose from their slumber to feast on the flesh of the living. A hapless electronics store employee who spends most of his spare time downing pints at the local pub with his roommate, Ed (Nick Frost), Shaun's life seems to fall apart when he is dumped by his girlfriend, Liz (Kate Ashfield), and his obnoxious stepfather, Philip (Bill Nighy), shows up to berate him for not being more attentive to his caring mother Barbara (Penelope Wilton) -- especially since he forgot to send flowers for her birthday. Things take a turn for the worse when the dead return to stake their claim on the Earth, and though the chaos that follows threatens to swallow up all of England, it's up to Shaun to keep his cool and prove himself once and for all by successfully rescuing Liz and his mother. With his trusty roommate by his side, nothing -- not even the living dead -- can stand between Shaun and the two most important women in his life(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Director Scott Derrickson's remake of the 1951 sci-fi classic replaces the original's theme of fear of impending nuclear war with current concerns for environmental catastrophe. Keanu Reeves stars as Klaatu, an alien sent by a confederation of extraterrestrial beings to warn the inhabitants of Earth that the biosphere is on the verge of collapse. Predictably, as soon as he emerges from his spaceship a trigger-happy soldier ignores his instructions and takes a shot at the visitor. The wounded Klaatu asks for access to the United Nations to deliver his message, but the Secretary of Defence, Regina Jackson, instead orders that he should be taken away for further investigations. Klaatu becomes increasingly convinced that Earth can only survive if mankind is eradicated..(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Parker</title>
    <desc lang="en">A principled thief seeks vengeance against the gang of criminals who left him for dead following a major heist as author Donald E. Westlake's pulp anti-hero returns to the screen under the assured direction of Hollywood veteran Taylor Hackford (The Devil's Advocate, Ray). When veteran thief Hurley (Nick Nolte) assembles a crackerjack crew for a big heist at the Ohio State Fair, his fiercely independent protégé Parker (Jason Statham) is the perfect man to take the lead on the job. Together with Melander (Michael Chiklis), Ross (Clifton Collins Jr.), Hardwicke (Micah Hauptman), and Carlson (Wendell Pierce), Parker successfully pulls off a daring daytime heist that nets the crew more than $1 million. But when Parker respectfully declines Melander's offer to invest their take in an ambitious diamond heist with a massive potential payday, he is unceremoniously shot and left for dead. Unfortunately for Melander and his gang, Parker is still very much alive, and he's determined to have his revenge. With the help of Hurley and Hurley's daughter Claire (Emma Booth), Parker manages to learn that the heist will take place in West Palm Beach, FL, and he travels there to pose as a wealthy Texan seeking to purchase a new home. Meanwhile, astute real-estate agent Leslie Rodgers (Jennifer Lopez) quickly sees through Parker's game and asks to get a cut of the action. Now a team, Parker and Leslie figure out that the gang is planning to hit a high-profile jewelry auction. All they have to do is wait until Melander and his men have pulled off the heist. Once the jewels are secure and the thieves are lying low at a local house, the stage will be set for Parker to take his revenge and make a small fortune in the process(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">After 11 series in as many years, the Harper family bids farewell in the last-ever episode. Susan and Janey are at a hen party, which is great fun until the bride announces her groom does not want her any more, while family friend Roger is excited about a blind date. The only one at home is Ben, who is babysitting Kenzo - although the grumpy dentist soon finds himself reluctantly going out too. Comedy, starring Robert Lindsay, Zoe Wanamaker, Daniela Denby-Ashe and Keiron Self.(n)</desc>

A DNA sample provides a link to a rebellious teenager, and the team wonders if the killer could be related to him. But a whole new can of worms is opened when investigators discover the lad's mother was raped - could the same person have killed Agnes? Gerry and Steve hope that interviewing her friends from a local chess club may shed new light on the matter, but it's a possible professional issue that could hold the key to unlocking the mystery. Denis Lawson and Dennis Waterman star.(n)</desc>

Plus, an 81-year-old man dies in hospital while receiving medical tests to diagnose his abdominal pain. Although he has an extensive medical history, there is no obvious reason for his death so Dr Garavaglia begins an autopsy to try to find the cause for the man's death certificate.(n)</desc>

Alex soon gets to the root of the family business's problem - 86-year-old Harry Pilgrim's refusal to let go of the reins has left son Mark frustrated in his role as general manager. Alex also believes the old-fashioned decor and unimaginative menu only attracts elderly clientele, so she sets about bringing the hotel into the 21st century. But can she persuade Mark to be more forceful as a leader?.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Black Christmas</title>
    <desc lang="en">Black Christmas is an effective, frightening above average slasher movie with a good cast and a frightening, surprise ending. Barb (Margot Kidder) and Jess (Olivia Hussey) are lonely sorority sisters who are having a Christmas party in their sorority house during the Christmas break. Peter (Keir Dullea) is a mad-killer who terrorizes the women by making threatening telephone calls. As the body count mounts, the women realize that the killer may be in the house. Black Christmas, one of the first of the slasher pictures, is still frightening despite some plot devices which have now become standard and predictable. Director Bob Clark uses his excellent cast to great effect, and the script, written by Roy Moore, has some great plot twists and a good, scary surprise ending. Black Christmas has also been released as Silent Night, Evil Night and Stranger in the House(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Meskada</title>
    <desc lang="en">Class and economics muddy the investigation of a homicide in this thriller from director Josh Sternfeld. When a child is found murdered in the small town of Hilliard, police detective Noah Cordin (Nick Stahl) is assigned to investigate the case. The victim's mother, Allison Connor (Laura Benanti), is a wealthy and well-connected member of the County Board of Commissioners, so Cordin is under pressure to find the killer as soon as possible, but working with rookie officer Leslie Spencer (Rachel Nichols), he isn't finding many substantial clues. One of the few pieces of evidence suggests the culprit may have been from the nearby town of Caswell. Cordin was born and raised in Caswell and knows its history well -- while Hilliard is a prosperous suburban community, Caswell is a working-class town fallen on hard times, and its survival is dependent on a proposed factory coming into town. As Cordin spends more and more time in Caswell, he becomes a target for the resentment the locals feel toward their wealthier neighbors, and a tense situation becomes potentially explosive when word begins to circulate that Connor may use her influence to keep the new employer out of Caswell unless someone comes forward to identity who killed her son. Meskada (named for the county that contains both Hilliard and Caswell) also stars Norman Reedus, Kellan Lutz, Jonathan Tucker, and Grace Gummer(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Big Eyes</title>
    <desc lang="en">The true story of painter Margaret Keane's life in obscurity while her husband gleaned the notoriety for being the face of her work is brought to the screen by Tim Burton and his Ed Wood screenwriters, Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. The story opens in the late 1950s, when Margaret Keane (Amy Adams) packs up the car with her daughter and their personal belongings, and leaves her husband to start a new life in San Francisco. There, Margaret quickly reconnects with her old friend DeeAnn (Krysten Ritter), and falls head over heels for Walter (Christoph Waltz), an artist and part-time real-estate broker who soon shows great interest in her unique paintings of small children with strikingly expressive, saucer-like eyes. Before long, the two are married, and Walter is claiming credit for Margaret's increasingly popular paintings. With the money rolling in, Margaret initially agrees to go along with the ruse, but the closer she gets to her new husband the more she begins to realize that he's little more than a smooth-talking scam artist. Later, riddled with guild over the fact that she's been deceiving her own daughter as her paintings become a pop-culture phenomenon, Margaret leaves the increasingly abusive Walter, and moves to Hawaii. Only then does Margaret gain the confidence to reclaim the works that have been credited to her husband, even when doing so entails going before the judge and proving that she and she alone created the enchanting children with the big eyes. Danny Huston, Terence Stamp, and Jason Schwartzman co-star(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">(2007) Ethan and Joel Coen's Oscar-laden thriller stars Josh Brolin as Llewelyn Moss, a trailer-dwelling welder and hunter. Hunting deer in the desert, he comes across a drugs exchange which has gone bloodily wrong, and among the detritus is a case containing $2m. He decides to appropriate the money, but it's not a wise move: he soon has the deadly assassin Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) on his trail, as well as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), and smiling bounty hunter Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson). As Moss tries to keep hold of the cash, and preserve both his own life and that of his wife Carla (Kelly Macdonald), a deadly game of cat-and-mouse is played out across the Tex-Mex border, as pursuers and the pursued try to gain the upper hand. In English, and Spanish with English subtitles. M,W,S(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">X-Men</title>
    <desc lang="en">One of the most popular superhero teams in comic book history finally comes to the screen in this big-budget adaptation of the long-running Marvel Comics series. Psychic Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) leads a school of skilled mutants called X-Men, a peacekeeping force to safeguard the world against a race of genetically mutated humans known as Homo Sapiens Superior. However, Magneto (Ian McKellen), a mutant with a powerful magnetic charge, has also begun to organize a team to strike first against what he believes to be a threat from humanity. When he kidnaps Rogue (Anna Paquin) from the X-Men's compound, Xavier and his forces must rescue her, even as they continue to vie with Magneto for the fearsomely strong mutant battler Wolverine (Hugh Jackman). Both Xavier and Magneto also have to contend with Senator Kelly (Bruce Davison), a heartless political leader who wants a final solution against mutants on both sides. Fighting for the forces of virtue with the X-Men are Famke Janssen as Jean Grey, Halle Berry as Storm, and James Marsden as Cyclops; Rebecca Romjin-Stamos as Mystique, Ray Park as the Toad, and Tyler Mane as Sabretooth are the minions of Magneto(n)</desc>

However, before Milo and Teddy can get their company off the ground, Milo receives a very tempting offer from Gary Winston (Tim Robbins), a trailblazing genius in the digital world who has turned his company N.U.R.V. (which stands for "Never Underestimate Radical Vision") into one of the richest and most powerful computer firms on Earth. While Milo is sympathetic to Teddy's beliefs that computer technology should belong to the people and that open source software is the most promising future lies, Winston has long been Milo's role model in design and research, and Milo feels Winston's offer is too good to pass up. Milo and his girlfriend Alice Poulson (Claire Forlani) move out to Silicon Valley, and at first Milo thrives on the challenges of his new position, and develops a close working relationship with fellow designer Lisa Calighan (Rachael Leigh Cook). But Milo underestimates the ruthlessness of the leading-edge software industry, and he soon learns there's a sinister undercurrent to Winston's drive to stay on top. Antitrust earned rising star Ryan Phillippe his first million-dollar paycheck after well-regarded roles in 54 and Cruel Intentions(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Monsignor</title>
    <desc lang="en">An ambitious priest discovers that honoring the Ten Commandments isn't as easy as he imagined in this drama. Father John Flaherty (Christopher Reeve) is a Catholic priest who was ordained during World War II, and soon found himself forced to fight enemy forces while serving as a chaplain in the Army. As his life and career in the church moves on, Flaherty finds himself frequently torn between his duty and devotion to the church and his ambitions, appetites, and the notion that the ends can justify the means. Flaherty eventually rises through the church hirarchy to win an appointment at the Vatican, where he helps to manage the church's finances. When the Vatican's books reveals a major cash flow crisis, Flaherty suggests a rather unusual plan to Cardinal Santoni (Fernando Rey) -- buy hard-to-find American goods at a discount, and then sell them at a profit to mafia kingpins, who will then sell them on the black market at premium prices. As Flaherty and Santoni debate the ethics of this scheme, Flaherty meets and finds himself becoming attracted to Clara (Genevieve Bujold), a postulant nun. Posing as an American businessman, Flaherty romances and seduces Clara, until she discovers his secret. Monsignor also stars Jason Miller, Robert Prosky, and Joe Patoliano(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Pink Panther</title>
    <desc lang="en">The world's most inept detective returns to the screen in this modern slapstick comedy. France's come-from-behind victory in the World Cup soccer championships turns tragic when the team's coach, Yves Gulant (Jason Statham), is murdered during a post-game celebration. Gulant's girlfriend, pop star Xania (Beyoncé Knowles), was standing by his side as he was felled by a poisoned dart, and in the chaos that followed a diamond ring he gave her was stolen, which held one of the world's largest and most valuable jewels, known as "the Pink Panther." The media and the public demand that the killer be found out and brought to justice, and Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Kevin Kline) of the Paris Police pledges to put his best man on the case. However, somehow the astoundingly clumsy but consistently lucky Inspector Jacques Clouseau (Steve Martin) gets the assignment instead, and with his assistant, Gendarme Gilbert Ponton (Jean Reno), in tow, Clouseau follows a dizzying trail of clues from Paris to New York City as he attempts to recover the rare diamond and find the villains who killed Gulant. An updated variant on the Inspector Clouseau comedies that helped make Peter Sellers a major star in the United States, The Pink Panther also stars Emily Mortimer, Kristin Chenoweth, Roger Rees, and William Abadie; leading man Steve Martin also wrote the film's screenplay(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Pink Panther</title>
    <desc lang="en">The world's most inept detective returns to the screen in this modern slapstick comedy. France's come-from-behind victory in the World Cup soccer championships turns tragic when the team's coach, Yves Gulant (Jason Statham), is murdered during a post-game celebration. Gulant's girlfriend, pop star Xania (Beyoncé Knowles), was standing by his side as he was felled by a poisoned dart, and in the chaos that followed a diamond ring he gave her was stolen, which held one of the world's largest and most valuable jewels, known as "the Pink Panther." The media and the public demand that the killer be found out and brought to justice, and Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Kevin Kline) of the Paris Police pledges to put his best man on the case. However, somehow the astoundingly clumsy but consistently lucky Inspector Jacques Clouseau (Steve Martin) gets the assignment instead, and with his assistant, Gendarme Gilbert Ponton (Jean Reno), in tow, Clouseau follows a dizzying trail of clues from Paris to New York City as he attempts to recover the rare diamond and find the villains who killed Gulant. An updated variant on the Inspector Clouseau comedies that helped make Peter Sellers a major star in the United States, The Pink Panther also stars Emily Mortimer, Kristin Chenoweth, Roger Rees, and William Abadie; leading man Steve Martin also wrote the film's screenplay(n)</desc>

In one, she is the neighbour of indie filmmaker Susan and her "resting" actor husband Hobie, into whose lives she comes, tempting Hobie towards adultery until Melinda begins a relationship, assuaging his guilt. In the other, she's the friend of Laura and her alcoholic husband Lee, a serial adulterer: can Melinda escape his clutches? Playing one set of circumstances for comedy, the other for tragedy, and cutting between the two scenarios throughout, the film is a fascinating study of character moulding by the director that keeps the viewer guessing until the very end(n)</desc>

Edward's endless recounting of yarns about himself has distanced father and son. But when Edward is diagnosed with terminal cancer, William returns to the family home to try and make his peace, and find out who his father really is.

    <desc lang="en">A mysterious stranger brings both spiritual comfort and a certain level of distrust to a small community in this drama based on the spiritual best-seller by Joseph Girzone. A mysterious man named Joshua (Tony Goldwyn) arrives in the small Midwestern town of Auburn sometime in the late 19th century. Joshua sets up a carpentry shop in Auburn, and soon develops a reputation for his kind and unselfish nature; after bad weather nearly destroys a church in the town's African-American neighborhood, Joshua offers to help repair the building, and has soon persuaded much of the community to offer their support, including Father Pat (Kurt Fuller), a priest at Auburn's Catholic church. Father Pat's superior, Father Tardone (F. Murray Abraham) is also struck by Joshua's talent, charm, and humble desire to help others, and asks him to carve a new statue of Saint Peter for their church. However, while much of the town is following the good example set by Joshua, when people begin to ascribe supernatural powers to the town's new carpenter, Father Tardone begins to become suspicious, and wants to know who Joshua really is and what he really intends to do in Auburn. Joshua features an original song score by popular contemporary Christian musician Michael W. Smith(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Big Fish</title>
    <desc lang="en">"In telling the story of my father, it's hard to separate fact from fiction. But that's the kind of story it is." So says William Bloom during the opening stages of Tim Burton's Big Fish. Bloom's father is Edward Bloom,an old codger who may be largely benign but is deemed a bullshitter by his son, and a selfish one at that. Edward's endless recounting of yarns about himself has distanced father and son. But when Edward is diagnosed with terminal cancer, William returns to the family home to try and make his peace, and find out who his father really is. Bed-bound, and with an audience of not just the cynical William but also his receptive wife Josephine, Edward recounts his remarkable life in fragments(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Baby's Day Out</title>
    <desc lang="en">Patrick Read Johnson's comedy, scripted by John Hughes, stars Joe Mantegna, Joe Pantoliano and Brian Haley as Eddie, Norby and Veeko, three inept criminals who kidnap Baby Bink, the son of a rich Chicago family. But while they are negotiating the ransom, Baby Bink escapes and begins to make his way back home. As the trio chase him, Baby Bink manages to avoid a series of violent dangers, only for his pursuers to run straight into them. The film owes much to cartoon humour such as Road Runner , where falls and explosions are slapstick rather than fatal, while the interaction of the three criminals carries Hughes's trademark quick-fire humour.

    <title lang="en">Millions</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Danny Boyle revisits a theme from his Shallow Grave and Trainspotting days -- greed -- but focuses on a much younger protagonist with this comedy drama. Millions opens with recent widower Ronnie (James Nesbitt) moving his two precocious pre-pubescent sons to the suburbs. Missing his mother and the comforts of his old neighborhood, the young Damian (Alex Etel) builds a cardboard-box fort on the outskirts of the suburb, where one day his placid introvert existence is literally crushed by a giant gym bag full of thousands of pounds' worth of cash. Less concerned with the origin of the money than with how to spend it, Damian and his older brother, Anthony (Lewis McGibbon), decide to keep it a secret from their father, which becomes an increasingly tricky proposition as the days pass. His conscience getting in the way of his spending, Damian debates the ethics of his ill-gotten gains with a handful of imaginary saints, and begins to try to spend his cash a little more altruistically. But his charitable deeds inadvertently attract the attention of a mysterious, threatening man who's desperate to get his hands on the money. Marking a distinct change of pace for Boyle after the horror film 28 Days Later, Millions world-premiered at the 2004 Toronto Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Still Valley. This episode was adapted by Rod Serling from "The Valley Was Still," a short story by Manley Wade Wellman. In the third year of the Civil War, Confederate officer Paradine (Gary Merrill) and his men march into a small town, where a regiment of Union Soldiers has been literally frozen in time. The only "moving figure" in the town is a deranged old man (Vaughn Taylor), who directs Paradine's attention to a book of black magic spells. Though he now possesses the means to win the war for the South, Paradine learns to his dismay that there's a diabolical "price tag" attached. First telecast November 24, 1961, "Still Valley" was the only half-hour Twilight Zone episode to be rebroadcast in the summer of 1963, by which time the series had expanded to an hour(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Jungle. Adapted by Charles Beaumont from his own short story, this episode stars John Dehner as Alan Richard, an American hydroelectric engineer, who has recently returned from a project in Africa. Having had a voodoo curse put on his head by the local witch doctors, Richard laughs off such silly superstitions, though his wife Doris (Emily McLaughlin) is terrified -- quite rightly, as it turns out. The second half of this nerve-wracking Twilight Zone episode is virtually without dialogue, as Alan Richard agonizingly tries to make his way back to his midtown home amidst an ever-escalating cacophony of hideous jungle noises. "The Jungle" originally aired December 1, 1961(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Five Characters in Search of an Exit. This episode was adapted by Rod Serling from Marvin Petal's short story "The Depository," but it could easily have been inspired by Jean-Paul Sartre's No Exit. Five people from various and assorted walks of life -- an Army major (William Windom), a clown (Murray Matheson), a ballerina (Susan Harrison), a tramp (Kelton Garwood), and a bagpipe player (Clark Allen) -- find themselves trapped in a huge, cylindrical prison. They don't know where they are or how they got there, but it soon becomes painfully clear that they'd better escape, lest they be driven crazy by the deafening peal of bell which periodically interrupts their conversation. Mona Houghton, daughter of Twilight Zone producer Buck Houghton, appears in the final scene. "Five Characters in Search of an Exit" first aired December 22, 1961(n)</desc>

Though Al (Ed O'Neill) is a bit more philosophical on the subject--after all, the world is full of famous chrome-domes, including Khrushchev, Fred Mertz and Gallagher--he becomes as paranoid as Steve after a bad experience with something called "Insta-Hair." The climax finds both Steve and Al attending a meeting of a club for bald men, which morphs into something like "Hair Anonymous."(n)</desc>

Peter's (voice of Seth MacFarlane) birthday trip to Bob's Funland is ruined when he meets Bob Funland, the owner. It turns out that Peter pushed Bob around when they were in high school, but now he's jealous of Bob's success. Chris (voice of Seth Green) gives Peter a painting for his birthday, and it's spotted by a fancy Soho art dealer, who buys it for 5,000 dollars. Excited at the prospect of having some vicarious success through his son, Peter takes Chris to New York, where the art dealer tries to transform him into a downtown hipster, and renames him "Christabel." "Painting is the least important part of being an artist," he tells Chris. "You need an image." "Christabel" begins dating Kate Moss, and is told that if he wants to be successful, he can never see his no-class family again. His dreams thwarted, Peter begins trying to find a talent for Meg (voice of Mila Kunis) to pursue. The family's trip takes an upturn when Stewie (MacFarlane) runs into "heterosexual fashion designer Calvin Klein," and launches a modeling career. This episode features vocal cameos from Murphy Brown cast members Candice Bergen, Faith Ford, Joe Regalbuto, and Charles Kimbrough(n)</desc>
