    <desc lang="en">Boat enthusiast James Strangeways invites Kevin McCloud to survey progress on the construction of his new home, which his architect nephew Ben Hebblethwaite has designed to be as `un-houselike' as possible. James has spent the past 35 years travelling the canals and waterways of Britain, and despite never liking houses, has decided now is the time to put down roots on dry land. Ben hoped a home standing on stilts above a marsh, and incorporating ship-like qualities such as a keel-shaped roof, will be enough to satisfy his boat-mad uncle. However, Ben's contractor goes into liquidation a few months into the project, taking £87,000 of the £300,000 budget, and when James decides to make a few tweaks to the design, alarm-bells begin to ring for the young architect.(n)</desc>

He floats through the rock clubs of Hollywood, picking up women and clients, and soon stumbles into a case involving the death of a heavy metal singer, a corrupt music executive (Wayne Newton), the murder of a radio shock-jock (Gilbert Gottfried), and the kidnapping of the jock's daughter (Maddie Corman).

    <title lang="en">Casanova</title>
    <desc lang="en">History's most renowned ladies' man finally meets his match in this historical romance laced with comedy and adventure. In Venice in 1753, Giacomo Casanova (Heath Ledger) is a notorious playboy whose way with women goes too far when he's caught leaving the bedroom of a novice nun, and one of the leading prosecutors of the Inquisition, Pucci (Jeremy Irons), puts him on trial. The Doge (Tim McInnerny), Venice's political point man, is a friend of Casanova's and pulls strings to get him off the hook and allow him to stay in the city, but under one condition -- he must take a wife and remain faithful to her. Casanova sets his sights on Victoria (Natalie Dormer), a lovely young maiden who is obviously taken with the handsome ladykiller, but he's not the only one who wants her hand. Giovanni Bruni (Charlie Cox) is a young man who is very much in love with Victoria, and in order to move him out of the picture, Casanova challenges him to a duel. However, when Casanova is bested in swords in the challenge, he discovers he's actually been parrying with Giovanni's sister, Francesca (Sienna Miller). As Casanova gets to know Francesca, he discovers she's a gifted writer and a bright and independent woman as well as a good hand with a sword, and he comes to the realization that she's the woman he wants to take to the altar. However, Francesca has already been promised to the vain and chubby Papprizzio (Oliver Platt), a man she's never met, and she doesn't seem at all interested in the notorious Casanova. Casanova also stars Lena Olin, and Omid Djalili(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Anything Else</title>
    <desc lang="en">A young artist struggling with his career and his muse is getting more than a little aggravation from Cupid in this romantic comedy written and directed by Woody Allen. Jerry Falk (Jason Biggs) is a promising 21-year-old comedy writer living in New York City. While Jerry has talent, he's having a hard time getting his career off the ground, which might have something to do with the fact his agent Harvey (Danny DeVito) is a well-meaning, but ineffectual, blowhard, and his mentor David Dobel (Allen) is an increasingly paranoid eccentric whose twin careers as a teacher and standup comic are both floundering. Poised at the top of Jerry's mountain of anxieties is his relationship with his girlfriend Amanda (Christina Ricci); from the first moment he saw her, Jerry has been in love with her, but Amanda's multiple neuroses, fear of commitment, and frustrating intimacy issues make her all but impossible to be around. Jerry is approaching his breaking point when the small flat he shares with Amanda becomes home to a third roommate -- Amanda's mother Paula (Stockard Channing), who has decided to come to New York to chase her dream of becoming a cabaret singer. Anything Else also features supporting performances from Jimmy Fallon, William Hill, and jazz vocalist Diana Krall(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Forgetting Sarah Marshall</title>
    <desc lang="en">In desperate need of a vacation after being unceremoniously dumped by his TV-star girlfriend, a man travels to a lavish Hawaiian resort to nurse his wounds and forget his heartache, only to discover that his ex and her handsome new boyfriend are currently staying at the exact same island hot spot. Peter Bretter (Jason Segel) may be just another struggling musician, but for the past six years he's been dating Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell), one of the hottest stars on television. Sarah is everything in the world to Peter, so when she kindly but firmly tells him that they should each go their separate ways, he is absolutely devastated. Later, after attempting to salvage his ego by awkwardly attempting to become a womanizer and nearly losing his job because of a nervous breakdown, an emotionally fragile Peter attempts to put the past behind him by escaping to the sun-soaked beaches of Oahu. While at first it seems as if Peter has discovered the perfect prescription for a bad case of lost love, his plan soon turns to dust when Sarah and her new rock-star boyfriend, Aldous (Russell Brand), turn up at the exact same resort. Though accepting Sarah's lavish new lifestyle won't be easy for the crestfallen Peter, the laid-back companionship of flirtatious resort employee Rachel (Mila Kunis) -- not to mention a continuous regimen of fruity cocktails -- goes a long way in mending the wounds of a broken heart. Forgetting Sarah Marshall was penned by Segel and produced by Judd Apatow. Fun with Dick and Jane screenwriter Nicholas Stoller makes his directorial debut. The cast also includes Paul Rudd, Bill Hader, Jack McBrayer, and Jonah Hill(n)</desc>

Only then will the unspeakable terror that stalks these deserted streets finally emerge from the shadows to launch one last relentless, terrifying attack(n)</desc>

Other matches taking place today in the men's draw include Wawrinka v Daniil Medvedev, and Nadal v John Millman.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Rachel de Thame joins Monty Don at Longmeadow to add more medicinal planting to the herb garden - especially those that bees love. She also investigates how gardeners can aid honey bee conservation and protect the nation's favourite pollinators. Monty visits a garden in Herefordshire to see a collection of Siberian Iris, which inspires him to create a new Iris patch, adding warmth and splash of colour into his dry garden. The green-fingered experts also discover a garden containing a stunning collection of clematis Montana. Plus, Nick Bailey reveals how to plan, design and build a border fit for any garden, while in Somerset, Carol Klein visits the home of Margery Fish, the writer who exercised a strong influence on the informal style of the cottage garden, before her death in 1969.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Documentary examining the famous Second World War evacuation of Allied soldiers - codenamed Operation Dynamo - from the beaches of Dunkirk, France, between May 26 and June 4, 1940. Recently released Ministry of Defence files reveal that, far from being absent as many historians have believed, the RAF was suffering massive losses supporting the evacuation. Operating at high altitude and deep inside France, RAF planes were halting the bulk of Luftwaffe bombers before they could reach the beaches. The files also reveal that the famous Spitfire took flight for the first time during the mission, and the agile fighter was a spectacular success.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Alex Polizzi heads to Ramsbottom in Greater Manchester to lend her expertise to Charlotte Belcher, who has been running the 14-bedroom Grant Arms Hotel for two and a half years.

With no profits to pay for renovations, Charlotte has enlisted her husband and two children to help turn the Grant Arms around, but her work-life balance is starting to tip drastically away from home, and the beleaguered hotelier hopes Alex will find a way to boost the hotel's income while also restoring her private life.(n)</desc>

Conceived and produced by Paranormal Activity's Oren Peli, Chernobyl Diaries gets underway as six thrill-seeking tourists hire a fearless tour guide, and travel to the abandoned Ukrainian city of Pripyat. Back when the Chernobyl nuclear reactor was up and running, Pripyat was the place the workers called home. But 25 years after one of the worst power-plant accidents in history, the city serves as an eerily silent testament to the dangers of nuclear power. Later, after getting unexpectedly stranded in Pripyat, the tourists and their guide realize they are being hunted. Now the harder they try to flee, the faster their numbers dwindle until only a few are left standing. Only then will the unspeakable terror that stalks these deserted streets finally emerge from the shadows to launch one last relentless, terrifying attack(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Based on a novel by Elleston Trevor, director John Moore's The Flight of the Phoenix is a remake of a 1965 film of the same name starring film icon James Stewart. The story revolves around the plight of Captain Frank Towns (Dennis Quaid), a pilot whose C-119 cargo plane full of oil workers could not withstand the violent winds of a desert sandstorm. Stranded in the harsh terrain of Mongolia's Gobi Desert (a departure from the original, in which the plane crashed in the Sahara), Frank and his navigator face an equal challenge in maintaining order among the survivors. The group of oilmen had planned on an uneventful trip to shut off a group of rigs falling below their productivity expectations -- not fending for their very lives. Before long, some men are revealed as cowards, while others exhibit a surprising show of strength, all the while hoping that the wreckage of the original plane can be salvaged before a Lord of the Flies situation occurs. Miranda Otto is featured in a supporting role, as well as Giovanni Ribisi and Tyrese Gibson(n)</desc>

Conceived and produced by Paranormal Activity's Oren Peli, Chernobyl Diaries gets underway as six thrill-seeking tourists hire a fearless tour guide, and travel to the abandoned Ukrainian city of Pripyat. Back when the Chernobyl nuclear reactor was up and running, Pripyat was the place the workers called home. But 25 years after one of the worst power-plant accidents in history, the city serves as an eerily silent testament to the dangers of nuclear power. Later, after getting unexpectedly stranded in Pripyat, the tourists and their guide realize they are being hunted. Now the harder they try to flee, the faster their numbers dwindle until only a few are left standing. Only then will the unspeakable terror that stalks these deserted streets finally emerge from the shadows to launch one last relentless, terrifying attack(n)</desc>

Wealthy and well-connected, Tom Capano was still subjected to the torments of the heart. When an affair with Anne Marie Fahey ended badly, he snapped. After murdering his ex-lover, Capano dumped her body in the water, a seemingly clever move. However, Capano never counted on the guilty conscience of his own brother to secure his undoing. The police kept the jealous boyfriend under surveillance until they had the sibling's confession as accomplice. Surprisingly, at trial, Capano himself admitted to removing the body. But, he held onto the claim that Fahey was killed by someone else. Capano was convicted and sentenced to death(n)</desc>

Their deeds often merit stiffer penalties and unforgiving jurors. A&amp;E explores the most notorious of this lot in the one-hour American Justice: Cop Killers. Named after an Ice-T song that attracted negative attention for its hateful lyrics, the program follows a man who blames music for his deed. Ronald Ray Howard claims rap made him assassinate a policeman during a routine traffic stop. Leroy Strachan was convicted 40 years after he murdered a cop for telling him not to enter a ballpark after hours. Perhaps most well-known is the videotaped killing of Texas Constable Darrell Lunsford who stopped a car transporting drugs. His dashboard camera captured it all. A&amp;E also visits the officers who dedicate their lives to finding cop killers and the prosecutors who put them away(n)</desc>

Revisiting the familiar case, the detective feels guilty she did not do more to help the family earlier. When a body is found, she follows a lead to the missing girl's old teacher, who had acted as her support buddy when she turned to prostitution to pay for her heroin habit, and nearly loses control when she is overcome by anger in the interrogation room. Ian Kelsey guest stars.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The arrest of a Turkish girl who has been working illegally leads Ucos to reopen the case of Richard Gibson, a pub landlord who died in a fire in 2009. The original investigation concluded Gibson's death was probably suicide due to his dire financial situation, but the detectives have some questions about the pub's live-in barmaid, who disappeared on the night of the blaze. Could widowed landlady Joanne, pub regular Jason, or the dead man's best friend David, who happens to have a sideline in passing off his British-produced sparkling wine as French champagne, supply them with any answers? While the case tests the team's brain power, Sasha is also keen to raise their fitness levels as she signs them up for a five-a-side football competition.

    <desc lang="en">Generally telecast on the weekend late-night schedule, the half-hour Whacked Out Sports was a reality "clip" show devoted to unusual sports activities and embarrassing bloopers.

In each market that the series played, viewers were invited to send in video clips of "crazy stuff never seen on TV" -- especially if "hot girls" were involved (that's what it said on the press release!). Seen on the NBC-owned stations in the larger markets, Whacked Out Sports was initially broadcast on September 7, 2006(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Amazing Spider-Man 2</title>
    <desc lang="en">The web-slingin' wall-crawler hits the screens once again in this follow-up to Marc Webb's 2012 reboot of the series. Andrew Garfield returns as Peter Parker, who squares off against the villainous Electro, played by Jamie Foxx. As the film opens, we find Richard (Campbell Scott) and Mary Parker (Embeth Davitz) stealing away with some crucial Oscorp files while leaving young Peter in the care of Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben. Flash forward about a decade, and Peter (Garfield) is swinging into action as Spider-Man; having successfully thwarted the hijacking of an Oscorp truck by notorious Russian criminal Aleksei Sytsevich (Paul Giamatti), Peter ditches the costume just in time to meet up with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) at their high school graduation. Despite his deep love for Emma, however, Peter remains haunted by his promise to her late father not to get emotionally involved with her for fear that she could be targeted by Spider-Man's enemies. Meanwhile, young Harry Osborne (Dane DeHaan) inherits OsCorp and a deadly retrovirus from his father Norman (Chris Cooper), and brilliant but timid OsCorp scientist Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx) gets infused with a powerful dose of electricity while attempting to fix a faulty power circuit in the lab. Upon regaining consciousness, Max discovers that he has the power to harness electrical currents - the higher the voltage the more powerful he becomes. When a battle with Max in Times Square shorts out Spidey's web-shooters, Peter goes to work on developing a more reliable model of his signature weapon while Harry grows convinced that Spider-Man's blood is the key to his survival. Later, villainous OsCorp chairman Donald Menken (Colm Feore) steals the company out right out from under Harry, driving the vengeful youth to break Max -- now Electro -- out of the heavily-guarded Ravencroft Institute for a two-pronged attack on Menken and Spider-Man. The stage for that battle is set when New York City goes dark just as Peter declares his love to Gwen, plunging the wise-cracking web-slinger into a fight that could forever alter the course of his life(n)</desc>

Given his short and undistinguished career in academia, Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) is surprised when he's invited to a ritzy social function at Springfield University, though Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) correctly guesses that he's been lured to a fund-raising event. Reunited with his pals Benjamin (voice of Harry Shearer), Doug (voice of Hank Azaria) and Gary (also voiced by Castellaneta), Homer decides they should play a prank on the Dean, which predictably backfires as Homer ends up with a bucket of Super Glue stuck to his head. Homer isn't able remove the bucket until he and his family attend a tent revival meeting led by traveling preacher Brother Faith (voice of Don Cheadle). Brother Faith claims he can channel his spiritual power through Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright), and the boy is able to remove the bucket; certain he has the gift of healing, Bart sets up his own revival, but realizes he has no special powers when his attempt to cure Milhouse (voice of Pamela Hayden) of his near-sightedness causes his friend to be hit by a car. Homer, however, still believes Bart can heal the sick, and when Springfield U's star kicker hurts his leg during the big game, he volunteers his son to mend the injury; as it happens, more than Springfield's pride is on the line when Bart learns local Mafiosi Fat Tony (voice of Joe Mantegna) has a lot of money riding on the game.

In Lost and Found, David Spade plays Dylan, who is about to open an new restaurant and has finally found the perfect apartment. The apartment just gets better when he meets his new neighbor, Lila (Sophie Marceau), a very beautiful women who has recently come to the United States from France. However, Lila has just gotten out of a bad relationship with René (Patrick Bruel), who doesn't want to leave her alone, so she has little interest in romance, preferring to devote herself to her cello and her dog Jack. One day, Jack runs away and Dylan finds him; when he returns the pooch to Lila, it's the first time she's been willing to speak in full sentences to him, though not for very long. Faster than you can say "That idea is so crazy it just might work!", Dylan decides to kidnap Jack; when Lila thinks the dog is lost, Dylan will generously volunteer to help look for him, which will give Dylan a chance to impress Lila when he's able to find Jack so quickly. Sure enough, Dylan swipes the dog, but from that point on the plan hardly goes the way he had hoped. Star David Spade also co-wrote the screenplay with J.B. Cook and Marc Meeks; the supporting cast includes Martin Sheen, Mitchell Whitfield, Artie Lang and Jon Lovitz(n)</desc>

In Lost and Found, David Spade plays Dylan, who is about to open an new restaurant and has finally found the perfect apartment. The apartment just gets better when he meets his new neighbor, Lila (Sophie Marceau), a very beautiful women who has recently come to the United States from France. However, Lila has just gotten out of a bad relationship with René (Patrick Bruel), who doesn't want to leave her alone, so she has little interest in romance, preferring to devote herself to her cello and her dog Jack. One day, Jack runs away and Dylan finds him; when he returns the pooch to Lila, it's the first time she's been willing to speak in full sentences to him, though not for very long. Faster than you can say "That idea is so crazy it just might work!", Dylan decides to kidnap Jack; when Lila thinks the dog is lost, Dylan will generously volunteer to help look for him, which will give Dylan a chance to impress Lila when he's able to find Jack so quickly. Sure enough, Dylan swipes the dog, but from that point on the plan hardly goes the way he had hoped. Star David Spade also co-wrote the screenplay with J.B. Cook and Marc Meeks; the supporting cast includes Martin Sheen, Mitchell Whitfield, Artie Lang and Jon Lovitz(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Good Guy</title>
    <desc lang="en">After executive producing the acclaimed documentary Manda Bala and the J.M. Coetzee adaptation Disgrace, Julio DePietro makes his feature debut as a writer-director with The Good Guy, a drama about ambitious young Wall Streeters fighting each other -- and sometimes their own decent nature -- to get ahead in the world. Our narrator, Tommy (Scott Porter of TV's Friday Night Lights), is young, clever, charming, and attractive. He's got a smart, pretty girlfriend, Beth (Alexis Bledel of Gilmore Girls), an urban conservationist. He's also very good at his investment broker job, impressing his ruthless, cynical boss, Cash (erstwhile "Brat Pack" member Andrew McCarthy). When a key member of Tommy's sales team suddenly leaves for a competitor, Tommy needs to fill his spot quickly, and takes a chance on the bumbling Daniel (Bryan Greenberg, Bride Wars), a former Marine and computer geek who seems a bit naïve about high finance and a bit nervous around women. Tommy takes Daniel under his wing, showing him how to dress, where to socialize, and how to charm attractive women. Their relationship is threatened when Daniel begins spending more time with Beth, joining her book club, and becoming her confidant. Tommy begins to question his decision to share his wisdom with Daniel, while Daniel is forced to decide what success really means to him, and where his loyalties lie. The Good Guy also stars Anna Chlumsky (In the Loop) and Aaron Yoo (Disturbia). The film had its world premiere at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">I-Spy</title>
    <desc lang="en">Yet another classic television series from the 1960s gets a big-screen update in this action-comedy inspired by the Bill Cosby/Robert Culp vehicle I Spy. Alex Scott (Owen Wilson) is a federal intelligence agent who has been assigned to find a particularly expensive and valuable weapon which has gone missing: a special stealth fighter jet which can not only hide from radar, but also turn invisible to the human eye. Scott learns a rogue agent has sold the jet to Gundars (Malcolm McDowell), a powerful and unscrupulous underground arms dealer. After blowing his opportunity to catch Gundars in the act, Scott formulates a Plan B -- it seems Gundars is a rabid boxing fan, so in order to get inside his organization, Scott recruits Kelly Robinson (Eddie Murphy), a longtime middleweight champion whose ego nearly exceeds his talent in the ring. Robinson is excited by the prospect of a life of espionage, but Scott and Robinson's personalities are like oil and water, and matters are hardly helped by the efforts of less-than-helpful fellow agents Rachel (Famke Janssen) and Carlos (Gary Cole). This adaptation of I Spy was directed by a woman who starred in a memorable television series herself, former Hill Street Blues regular Betty Thomas, who has gone on to a successful career behind the camera(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Cider House Rules</title>
    <desc lang="en">John Irving scripted this screen adaptation of his 1985 novel. Set during World War II, The Cider House Rules concerns Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire), an orphan who spent most of his childhood at the St. Cloud Orphanage in rural Maine, where he grew up under the strong but affectionate care of Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine). Larch has passed along his medical education to Homer, and the young man helps the doctor care for abandoned children and the newborn babies of unwed mothers; however, Homer refuses to assist Larch with the illegal abortions that he performs on the side; Homer has moral objections to abortion, while Larch believes in the rights of the individual and sees it as his duty to keep women in need away from dangerous incompetents. Wally Worthington (Paul Rudd), an air-force pilot, brings his girlfriend Candy (Charlize Theron) to St. Cloud for an abortion, and Homer decides to go with them when they leave, hoping to see the world; however, the three end up going no further than the state line, where Wally's mother (Kate Nelligan) runs an apple orchard and cider mill, and Candy's family traps lobsters. When Wally ships off to battle, Homer grows closer to Candy, and the two fall in love. But their idyllic life at the cider mill is interrupted when Rose Rose (Erykah Badu), a field worker at the orchard, becomes pregnant and her father, cider-house foreman Mr. Rose (Delroy Lindo), turns out to be the father of her unborn child. This news coupled with the death of Dr. Larch, forces Homer to take a long look at both his moral principles and his future. Rapper Heavy D appears in the supporting cast as Peaches(n)</desc>

This is the iconic West as it truly is, as Wild now as it was in the glory days of the cinematic past(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Predator.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The broadcaster continues his bug-eyed view of the world of creepy-crawlies, revealing how predators defuse the defences of their prey. Highlights include the cockroach wasp, busy preparing a tasty - and very live - treat for its young, the whirligig beetle, which employs a water-based radar system, and the jumping portia spider, which feeds on other arachnids.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A further selection of creepy-crawly close-ups, focusing on courtship in the bug world. Highlights include scorpions shaking their booty, the perfume-wearing nasonia wasp and the tropical cricket, for whom romance goes out of the window as it uses bribery to seal the deal with would-be partners. One potential partner to steer well clear of, however, is the praying mantis, the female of which is notorious for eating the male just after - or even during - mating. Narrated by David Attenborough.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Reproduction.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">A close-up view of sex, bug-style, as David Attenborough talks viewers through the different ways in which creepy-crawlies reproduce. Size matters for the minuscule male orb spider, creepily sneaking up on its intended and trying to mate without her noticing, while there's no rest for the lothario-like butterfly, which has plenty of notches on its proverbial bedpost. However, the harvestman spider has no use for sex at all, and reproduces by cloning itself.(n)</desc>
