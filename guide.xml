Operating at high altitude and deep inside France, RAF planes were halting the bulk of Luftwaffe bombers before they could reach the beaches. The files also reveal that the famous Spitfire took flight for the first time during the mission, and the agile fighter was a spectacular success.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Directed by Walter Salles Jr., this remake of Hideo Nakata's supernatural psychological drama Honogurai Mizuno Soko Kara revolves around the plight of a single mother (Jennifer Connelly) whose messy divorce and subsequent battle for the custody of her five-year-old daughter is taking a heavy toll on her emotional well-being. Ultimately, the mother and daughter are able to relocate to an apartment, which, despite its excessively dilapidated interior, seems to be an adequate location for beginning a new life. Before long, however, what appears to be the spirit of a young girl begins to haunt them. No stranger to mental illness, the wary young woman brushes the visions aside as part of the inherent stress of making the transition from housewife to working, single mom. As time goes by and the apparent haunting does not subside, the apartment's new residents are forced to examine the history of its former tenants. Dark Water also features performances from John C. Reilly, Tim Roth, and Dougray Scott(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Tremors</title>
    <desc lang="en">Based on the cult-favorite "giant worm" film of the same name, the weekly, hour-long Tremors: The Series found Michael Gross repeating his screen role as neurotic worm-buster Burt Gummer. The series took place in the ironically yclept community of Perfection Valley, NV, where all manner of huge and slimy creatures have wrought havoc from beneath the ground. In the tradition of Roswell, NM, Perfection Valley has profited mightily from its disastrous past experiences with such slithery species as the Graboids, the Shriekers, and the AssBlasters, with ex-hippie Nancy Sterngood (Marcia Strassman) growing wealthy by selling ceramic statues of the aforementioned creatures over the Internet, and hot rodder-cum-pilot Tyler Reed (Victor Browne) managing the lucrative "Desert Jack's Graboid Tours." Also on the premises was Department of the Interior agent W.D. Twitchell (Dean Norris), whose job it was to put up bureaucratic barriers against killing off the various and sundry super-worms because of their "endangered species" status. Meanwhile, Burt Gummer, often working in concert with grocer Jodi Chang (Lela Lee) and rancher Rosalita Sanchez (Gladys Jimenez), did his best to protect Perfection Valley from any and all future creepy-crawly invaders -- and when the worms came out anyway (as they always did), Burt utilized a veritable arsenal of jerry-built weaponry to thwart the yucky scourges. Tremors: The Series debuted over cable's Sci-Fi Channel (surprise, surprise!) on March 28, 2003(n)</desc>

Meeting up with the uninfected Selena, Frank and Hannah, they set off in Frank's taxi to Manchester, where a group of soldiers led by Major Henry West offer a safe haven. But after surviving the terrors of the journey, on arriving at the encampment, their troubles are just beginning..(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Flight of the Phoenix</title>
    <desc lang="en">Based on a novel by Elleston Trevor, director John Moore's The Flight of the Phoenix is a remake of a 1965 film of the same name starring film icon James Stewart. The story revolves around the plight of Captain Frank Towns (Dennis Quaid), a pilot whose C-119 cargo plane full of oil workers could not withstand the violent winds of a desert sandstorm. Stranded in the harsh terrain of Mongolia's Gobi Desert (a departure from the original, in which the plane crashed in the Sahara), Frank and his navigator face an equal challenge in maintaining order among the survivors. The group of oilmen had planned on an uneventful trip to shut off a group of rigs falling below their productivity expectations -- not fending for their very lives. Before long, some men are revealed as cowards, while others exhibit a surprising show of strength, all the while hoping that the wreckage of the original plane can be salvaged before a Lord of the Flies situation occurs. Miranda Otto is featured in a supporting role, as well as Giovanni Ribisi and Tyrese Gibson(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Day Four.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Sue Barker introduces further coverage from the All England Club, as the second-round matches continue in the men's and ladies' singles. Two of the more notable clashes in the bottom half of the men's draw scheduled to take place today are Juan Martin del Potro v Ernests Gulbis, and Adam Pavlasek v Novak Djokovic, and they are made all the more enticing by the fact that should Del Potro and Djokovic overcome their respective opponents, it will set up an intriguing clash between the pair in round three. Djokovic's pedigree on the grass courts of Wimbledon is excellent, having won the tournament three times, most recently in 2015, and despite struggling to find his best form this year, he did triumph at the AEGON International in Eastbourne last week, in preparation for this year's Grand Slam.(n)</desc>

Players from the bottom half of the men's draw and the top half of the ladies' draw are expected to be in action today, which means the crowds may well be treated to Milos Raonic v Mikhail Youzhny, Gael Monfils v Kyle Edmund, and Angelique Kerber v Kirsten Flipkens, among others. For Great Britain's Edmund, this is the first time in his career he has progressed to the second round at SW19, and having battled past compatriot Alexander Ward last time out, now faces a stern test in Frenchman Monfils. Meanwhile, as the top seed in the ladies' tournament, Kerber will be expected to overcome the unseeded Flipkens, although the Belgian has shown in the past she is capable of performing well on grass, having reached the semi-finals as recently as 2013.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Day Five.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Sue Barker introduces the opening coverage of day five at the All England Club, where the men's and ladies' third-round singles matches are due to get under way. The rain intervened on day five last year to leave most of the matches unplayed, contributing to the decision to play on the middle Sunday for only the fourth time in Wimbledon history. The roof on Centre Court came into its own though, with Stan Wawrinka left cursing the draw, as he faced the unseeded Juan Martin del Potro, who was continuing his recovery from injury. This second-round match was finely poised throughout, but the Argentine secured the third set on a tie-break before going on to defeat the fourth seed in four sets. Another match that was in doubt for most of its duration was the only one to finish on Court One, as former champion Venus Williams edged through against Daria Kasatkina, winning 10-8 in the final set.(n)</desc>

After her undercover mission at the Miss United States pageant becomes public knowledge, Gracie becomes something of a celebrity, and the FBI uses her notoriety to generate positive PR for the bureau; however, Gracie would like to get back to some solid police work, especially after scuffling with fellow female agent "Sam" Fuller (Regina King), who isn't impressed with Gracie. Despite their differences, the two find themselves working side by side when two of Gracie's pals from the pageant -- contest winner Cheryl Frasier (Heather Burns) and master of ceremonies Stan Fields (William Shatner) -- fall victim to kidnappers. As she did on the first film, Sandra Bullock served as both producer and star for Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous, while director John Pasquin's credits include several episodes of the situation comedy George Lopez, also produced by Bullock(n)</desc>

Wealthy and well-connected, Tom Capano was still subjected to the torments of the heart. When an affair with Anne Marie Fahey ended badly, he snapped. After murdering his ex-lover, Capano dumped her body in the water, a seemingly clever move. However, Capano never counted on the guilty conscience of his own brother to secure his undoing. The police kept the jealous boyfriend under surveillance until they had the sibling's confession as accomplice. Surprisingly, at trial, Capano himself admitted to removing the body. But, he held onto the claim that Fahey was killed by someone else. Capano was convicted and sentenced to death(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Britain's Favourite Superhero</title>
    <desc lang="en">Documentary making extensive use of interviews and clips from big-budget Hollywood blockbusters to explore the story of how superheroes - once exclusively found on the pages of comic books - found their way to the silver screen, becoming bankable cinematic icons in the process. A Channel 4 poll outlines which do-gooders the British public have taken to their hearts, and the programme charts the history of big-screen heroics from the release of the ground-breaking Superman: The Movie in 1978 through to the high-profile releases arriving in cinemas in 2016. Along the way, viewers are given a chance to revisit Tim Burton's noir-themed iteration of Batman in the 1990s, the angst-filled antics of the X-Men and Spider-Man in the early noughties, and the far-reaching storylines of Marvel's inter-connected Avengers films. All this culminates as the poll results reveals which five heroes have captured British imaginations to become the nation's favourites.(n)</desc>

After a series of mishaps, including the arrest and incarceration of the officer in charge of the project, the unlucky pair are abandoned and forgotten, only to wake up 500 years later in a world where the rampant breeding of stupid people has created a universally dumb society ruled by half-wits.

Flash forward to the new millennium and the four Sons of Ipswich are now the student elite at the prestigious Spenser Academy. Bound by their sacred ancestry and sworn to silence, these four teens share a secret so remarkable that it has served to protect their families for hundreds of years.

    <title lang="en">Machine Gun Preacher</title>
    <desc lang="en">Gerard Butler stars in Marc Forster's violent, fact-based drama about a substance-addicted criminal who finds God and relocates to Sudan to offer his own idiosyncratic brand of Christian charity. The film initially portrays Sam Childers as being a far from nice man: a misogynistic biker whose life is steeped in crime, narcotics and violence, and who quickly returns to armed robbery almost as soon as he's released from jail. But while he was inside, his wife Lynn found Jesus, and, after Sam gets stabbed, she urges him to join her at church. Sam subsequently has his own Damascene moment and starts life afresh, founding his own (legitimate) construction company. Before long he has also built his own church. But it's only after a trip to Sudan, where he witnesses the devastation wrought by the marauding Lord's Resistance Army, that he truly becomes driven. Relocating to the African country, he sets up a faith-based centre to care for victims of the LRA's violence and rape. And also takes up arms to literally fight the good fight... Also starring Michael Shannon(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Covenant</title>
    <desc lang="en">An ancient secret threatens to unleash the powers of darkness on a group of modern prep-school students when the sole survivor of a cursed bloodline returns to lay claim to the powers denied to him centuries ago in a supernatural teen thriller from director Renny Harlin and screenwriter J.S. Cardone. The story begins in 1692, when five families from the Ipswich Colony of Massachusetts formed a covenant of silence that would forever protect their remarkable powers. One family went too far, though, and as a result of their transgression they were forever banished from the land. Flash forward to the new millennium and the four Sons of Ipswich are now the student elite at the prestigious Spenser Academy. Bound by their sacred ancestry and sworn to silence, these four teens share a secret so remarkable that it has served to protect their families for hundreds of years. The past has a way of coming back when you least expect it though, and when the fifth Son of Ipswich returns seeking to harness the powers denied him in the past, the battle is on to ensure the safety of The Covenant and lay the one descendent who threatens to reveal their secret to rest once and for all(n)</desc>

They then cook a showstopping dish for the judges and food critic Jay Rayner, before finding out who has made it through to the semi-finals.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Mafia!</title>
    <desc lang="en">Satirist Jim Arahams returned with this comedy spoofing the Godfather trilogy, and other films and TV, including Jurassic Park, Lord of the Dance, and Barney. The opening emulates a Saul Bass sequence with Anthony Cortino (Jay Mohr) in a flight amid flames much like Robert De Niro in the Casino credits. After flashbacks go back in time to Sicily, Coppola/Scorsese references abound. Young Vincenzo (Jason Fuchs) travels to America to later become the clumsy chief of organized crime (with the late Lloyd Bridges as the aging Vincenzo) with his sons -- short-fused Joey (Billy Burke) and educated Anthony. Tony's WASP fiancee is Diane (Christina Applegate), recalling Diane Keaton in the Coppola films. During the wedding, assassins try to do away with Don Vincenzo, who's hospitalized, so Tony sets out to gain revenge for the murder attempt. In Vegas, Tony gets involved with showgirl Pepper (Pamela Gidley). When betrayals begin, can violence be far behind? This was Lloyd Bridges' final movie, and the film is dedicated to him(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Good Guy</title>
    <desc lang="en">After executive producing the acclaimed documentary Manda Bala and the J.M. Coetzee adaptation Disgrace, Julio DePietro makes his feature debut as a writer-director with The Good Guy, a drama about ambitious young Wall Streeters fighting each other -- and sometimes their own decent nature -- to get ahead in the world. Our narrator, Tommy (Scott Porter of TV's Friday Night Lights), is young, clever, charming, and attractive. He's got a smart, pretty girlfriend, Beth (Alexis Bledel of Gilmore Girls), an urban conservationist. He's also very good at his investment broker job, impressing his ruthless, cynical boss, Cash (erstwhile "Brat Pack" member Andrew McCarthy). When a key member of Tommy's sales team suddenly leaves for a competitor, Tommy needs to fill his spot quickly, and takes a chance on the bumbling Daniel (Bryan Greenberg, Bride Wars), a former Marine and computer geek who seems a bit naïve about high finance and a bit nervous around women. Tommy takes Daniel under his wing, showing him how to dress, where to socialize, and how to charm attractive women. Their relationship is threatened when Daniel begins spending more time with Beth, joining her book club, and becoming her confidant. Tommy begins to question his decision to share his wisdom with Daniel, while Daniel is forced to decide what success really means to him, and where his loyalties lie. The Good Guy also stars Anna Chlumsky (In the Loop) and Aaron Yoo (Disturbia). The film had its world premiere at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Parenthood</title>
    <desc lang="en">This feel-good ensemble comedy tracks a quartet of suburban siblings and their families over the course of a single summer. Hardworking Gil Buckman (Steve Martin) and his stay-at-home wife, Karen (Mary Steeenburgen), have just a few months to help their oldest son, Kevin (Jasen Fisher), overcome his high-strung behavior problems before he'll be relegated to special-education classes. Gil's difficult relationship with his own father, Frank (Jason Robards), has led him to become a would-be super-dad for his three kids, so he takes his son's difficulties more than a little personally. Gil's sister, Helen (Dianne Wiest), is trying to raise a moody, adolescent son (Leaf Phoenix) and an independent-minded daughter (Martha Plimpton) with no help from her well-off ex-husband, who's more interested in his new wife and family. Gil and Helen's sister, Susan (Harley Jane Kozak), meanwhile, must participate in the too-scripted Big Life Plans of her anal-retentive husband, Nathan (Rick Moranis), whose overachiever zeal infects even their toddler daughter. When long-lost brother Larry (Tom Hulce) show up with yet another get-rich-quick scheme, he brings with him a surprise addition to the family. Screenwriters Babaloo Mandel, Lowell Ganz, and Ron Howard negotiate their varied subplots with a deftness and comedic touch that transforms this conflicted clan into a suburban everyfamily(n)</desc>

Adrian Monk is a highly gifted detective whose career is jeopardised by his overwhelming fear of germs, crowds, small places, and almost everything else...(although he's making progress on milk). Monk's disorder was triggered by the murder of his beloved wife, Trudy, which continues to haunt him as the only unsolved mystery in his career. Ordered to take a leave of absence from the police department, Monk hires Sharona, a nurse who helps him try to get reinstated on the force, and in the process, becomes an unlikely Dr. Watson to his Sherlock Holmes. When the police department find themselves unable to crack a high-profile case, they have no choice but to bring back the only man for the job...phobias and all(n)</desc>

But in 2010, she lured an innocent man to a dark alleyway where her friends were waiting to rob him. Instead he ended up being shot dead. Even though she didn't pull the trigger, and was nowhere near when the bullets were fired, Jennifer was sentenced to life without parole. Piers charts the journey through fame and rejection that saw Jennifer descend into a criminal lifestyle, and asks family members and legal experts if they believe her punishment was too harsh.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Pigzilla. Australia is being over-run by an invader. At as many as twenty-three million strong, feral pigs have already caused untold damage, and further destruction is inevitable if they're not stopped. Highly intelligent, hardy, and adaptable feral pigs are thriving in the land down-under. Here, they're endangering native species, spreading disease, destroying farmland, and even attacking people. Deliberately introduced by humans centuries ago, now it's up to humans to keep their populations in check. But that's easier said than done. So scientists and citizens are now resorting to a range of methods to defend their country. Join Nat Geo WILD as we tag along with the people who are defending Australia from this dangerous invader(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">For two years, a monster crocodile terrorizes a small Filipino community. It starts in 2009, with an attack on two young school girls - in which the crocodile decapitates 11-year-old Rowena Ruiz. More attacks on fishermen and livestock follow until September 2011, when Filipino croc legend Ronnie Sumiller succeeds in catching the killer alive. Called Lolong, the beast that they pull from the swamp is more massive than anything they've ever seen. Crocodile biologist Adam Britton arrives to measure it and officially certifies it as the Guinness Book of Records' largest known crocodile in the world. But there is dissent among the villagers - they're certain Lolong is the wrong croc, and that an even bigger monster is still out there(n)</desc>

Sid (John Leguizamo), a goofy and talkative sloth, wakes up to find that everyone's started to migrate south to avoid the onset of the Ice Age. Afraid of being deserted, he tags along with Manfred (Ray Romano), an embittered mammoth who's decided he'd rather head north. After stumbling across a human camp that's under attack by a pride of sabre-toothed tigers and narrowly saving a baby, they're joined by Diego, a sabretooth who convinces them he can help return the child by tracking the humans. However, he's actually a member of the same pride - and is plotting to guide them into an ambush. Can Manny and Sid find the baby's father and avoid the frozen weather? Or will Diego's plan mean they never make it? Also featuring the voice of Jack Black(n)</desc>

Dave lives with his wife and his ex-wife, who happen to be sisters, but that doesn't stop him from picking up women in bars and going to bed with a lawyer who may or may not be investigating him. As his life spirals out of control, Dave makes one last desperate grab for cash.

    <title lang="en">Cold Souls</title>
    <desc lang="en">Writer/director Sophie Barthes crafts this metaphysical tragicomedy, which straddles the line between reality and fantasy, set in a world where souls are extracted from humans and traded as commodites. Paul Giamatti is an anxious New Yorker who finds the answer to his deep-rooted malaise after stumbling upon an article about a high-tech company that claims to have found a solution to human suffering. By deep-freezing souls, claims the company, they can give their customers a life free from fear, doubt, and worry. Eager to free himself from the emotional burden of angst, Giamatti eagerly enlists their services. Trouble arises, however, when Giamatti's soul is swiped by a soul-trafficking "mule" who in turn gives it to a no-talent Russian soap opera actress. Now, in order to get back the soul that is rightfully his, Giamatti must make the arduous trip to St. Petersburg, along the way discovering that the true key to happiness isn't the absence of pain, but the ability to experience the entire spectrum of emotion and cherish the things that really matter(n)</desc>

When car dealer and one-time crook Terry Leather is approached by his old flame Martine Love with a proposition that would put his money worries behind him for good, he jumps at the chance. Leather quickly assembles a team which digs a tunnel directly into a London bank's vault. But what he hasn't been told is that, in addition to the money, he'll also be stealing a safety box containing material that would be extremely damaging to the royal family if it saw the light of day. Another box they take holds further dramatic revelations concerning establishment figures. So it's not long before Leather and the gang are pursued by the police, MI5 and various thugs, all keen to get their hands on the incendiary information... Edited for sexual scenes(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Writer/director Sophie Barthes crafts this metaphysical tragicomedy, which straddles the line between reality and fantasy, set in a world where souls are extracted from humans and traded as commodites. Paul Giamatti is an anxious New Yorker who finds the answer to his deep-rooted malaise after stumbling upon an article about a high-tech company that claims to have found a solution to human suffering. By deep-freezing souls, claims the company, they can give their customers a life free from fear, doubt, and worry. Eager to free himself from the emotional burden of angst, Giamatti eagerly enlists their services. Trouble arises, however, when Giamatti's soul is swiped by a soul-trafficking "mule" who in turn gives it to a no-talent Russian soap opera actress. Now, in order to get back the soul that is rightfully his, Giamatti must make the arduous trip to St. Petersburg, along the way discovering that the true key to happiness isn't the absence of pain, but the ability to experience the entire spectrum of emotion and cherish the things that really matter(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Cold Souls</title>
    <desc lang="en">Writer/director Sophie Barthes crafts this metaphysical tragicomedy, which straddles the line between reality and fantasy, set in a world where souls are extracted from humans and traded as commodites. Paul Giamatti is an anxious New Yorker who finds the answer to his deep-rooted malaise after stumbling upon an article about a high-tech company that claims to have found a solution to human suffering. By deep-freezing souls, claims the company, they can give their customers a life free from fear, doubt, and worry. Eager to free himself from the emotional burden of angst, Giamatti eagerly enlists their services. Trouble arises, however, when Giamatti's soul is swiped by a soul-trafficking "mule" who in turn gives it to a no-talent Russian soap opera actress. Now, in order to get back the soul that is rightfully his, Giamatti must make the arduous trip to St. Petersburg, along the way discovering that the true key to happiness isn't the absence of pain, but the ability to experience the entire spectrum of emotion and cherish the things that really matter(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Hills Have Eyes</title>
    <desc lang="en">Horror auteur Wes Craven followed his threadbare but horrifically compelling cult classic Last House on the Left with this wonderfully demented morality fable about a bloody war of attrition between two extremely different families. The story opens on the journey of the Carters, a mildly dysfunctional extended family led by patriarch "Big Bob" Carter (Russ Grieve), as they travel across the California desert in search of an inherited silver mine. When a broken axle leaves them stranded in the middle of a former nuclear testing site, their attempts to find help lead them unwittingly into the territory of a savage family of cave-dwelling cannibals, the apparent progeny of the bearlike Jupiter (James Whitworth) and an abducted prostitute. Jupiter's eldest son Pluto (professional movie weirdo Michael Berryman) leads the first brutal attack on the defenseless Carters who, through necessity, are driven to equally extreme measures in order to survive. Though the film is not overtly bloody, the scenes depicting this confrontation are rendered with an unflinching directness, and the violations visited on the Carters are so brutal as to make the survivors' regression into savagery all the more convincing. No one is spared from the nightmare: Jupiter's boys have even kidnapped the youngest member of the Carter family -- a mere infant -- to serve as fodder for their next barbecue, and the baby becomes the main point of contention between the rival clans. Craven nevertheless refuses to take the easy way out by depicting his "monsters" as soullessly evil; parallels between either family's "values" are clearly drawn as the differences between the two clans begin to blur(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">It Runs in the Family</title>
    <desc lang="en">A family takes on the difficult task of learning how to get along with one another in this emotional comedy drama. Alex Gromberg (Michael Douglas) is a middle-aged man who feels caught in the middle of his familial obligations as he muddles he way through a midlife crisis. While a successful businessman, Alex sometimes still feels as if he's under the shadow of his father, Mitchell Gromberg (Kirk Douglas), a successful attorney whose skills in the courtroom outstripped his gifts as a parent. Elderly Mitchell has recently survived a stroke, and Alex and Mitchell want to mend their relationship while there's still time, but making it so proves difficult, even with Alex getting advice from his wife, psychologist Rebecca (Bernadette Peters), and Mitchell being prodded by his long-suffering wife, Evelyn (Diana Douglas). Alex is also trying to reach out to his two sons, who are as different as night and day; college student Asher (Cameron Douglas) is an aspiring club DJ who seems to be styling himself to bear no resemblance to his father, while 11-year-old Eli (Rory Culkin) is an overly serious lad who is having trouble navigating the first steps of adolescence. It Runs in the Family marked the first time Kirk Douglas acted in a film with his son Michael Douglas; adding to the family atmosphere was Michael's son Cameron Douglas, working with his family for the first time, and Diana Douglas, Kirk's former wife and Michael's mother(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">It Runs in the Family</title>
    <desc lang="en">A family takes on the difficult task of learning how to get along with one another in this emotional comedy drama. Alex Gromberg (Michael Douglas) is a middle-aged man who feels caught in the middle of his familial obligations as he muddles he way through a midlife crisis. While a successful businessman, Alex sometimes still feels as if he's under the shadow of his father, Mitchell Gromberg (Kirk Douglas), a successful attorney whose skills in the courtroom outstripped his gifts as a parent. Elderly Mitchell has recently survived a stroke, and Alex and Mitchell want to mend their relationship while there's still time, but making it so proves difficult, even with Alex getting advice from his wife, psychologist Rebecca (Bernadette Peters), and Mitchell being prodded by his long-suffering wife, Evelyn (Diana Douglas). Alex is also trying to reach out to his two sons, who are as different as night and day; college student Asher (Cameron Douglas) is an aspiring club DJ who seems to be styling himself to bear no resemblance to his father, while 11-year-old Eli (Rory Culkin) is an overly serious lad who is having trouble navigating the first steps of adolescence. It Runs in the Family marked the first time Kirk Douglas acted in a film with his son Michael Douglas; adding to the family atmosphere was Michael's son Cameron Douglas, working with his family for the first time, and Diana Douglas, Kirk's former wife and Michael's mother(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A group of close female friends on a yearly adventure vacation find themselves trapped and hunted in a series of caves by an unknown force that lurks in the shadows in The Descent, the second horror feature from Dog Soldiers writer/director Neil Marshall. After suffering a devastating car crash one year before, Sarah (Shauna Macdonald) is lured to the States with her friend Beth (Alex Reid) to a special spelunking trip by the fearless Juno (Natalie Mendoza), who abruptly fled from the U.K. after Sarah's accident. Along with two old friends and a new acquaintance of Juno's, the group embark on a cave expedition that takes a turn for the worse after a rock fall leaves them stranded in an uncharted cave with no map and only a handful of supplies to last them the rest of the trip. As tensions arise in the group, they are faced with another danger -- one whose love of the dark is as strong as its lust for blood. Opening to rave reviews in the U.K. in July of 2005, the creature-feature went on to show at the Venice Film Festival and garnered the top prize for Euro feature at Sweden's Fantastic Film Festival. The Descent was picked up for future U.S. distribution by Lion's Gate, whose work was cut out for them considering the tame opening of the similarly-themed stateside production of The Cave in late-August of the same year(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Legend of the Fist: The Return of Chen Zhen</title>
    <desc lang="en">A celebrated Chinese hero returns to the mainland seven years after the fight that made him a myth, and assumes the identity of a masked crusader in order to expose the clandestine alliance between the Japanese and the mafia, and to procure a vital assassination list in this epic action thriller from Infernal Affairs director Andy Lau. At the height of the Warlord Era, China is being torn apart though internal conflict, allowing Japanese forces to gain a foothold in Northern Shanghai. His mentor murdered by Japanese troops, Chinese avenger Chen Zhen (Donnie Yen) single-handedly defeats an entire dojo full of enemy combatants amidst a blinding shower of bullets. Though his body is never recovered, Chen Zhen is presumed to have perished in the fight. Flash forward seven years, when high-ranking Japanese officials rub elbows with ruthless gangsters in the lavish Casablanca nightclub as the impoverished masses starve in the streets. Suddenly, into the Shanghai social scene steps a wealthy entrepreneur named "Ku" (also Yen), whose obvious affluence quickly gains him an audience with the most powerful mob boss in town. Little do the local criminal masterminds realize it's all an elaborate ruse; by day Ku uses his relationship with the formidable gangster to gather intelligence on the collusion between the Chinese underworld and the Japanese military, and by night he dons a mask in order to fight the powers attempting to oppress his people. But the closer Ku grows to scorching beauty Kiki (Shu Qi), the more he risks blowing his cover. Later, when Ku discovers evidence of a top-secret Japanese hit list that threatens to shift the balance of power in their favor, he prepares to risk his life in a fight that could alter the future of an entire nation, and give the downtrodden masses hope for a better future(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Hot Chick</title>
    <desc lang="en">A carefree young woman wakes up to discover her greatest nightmare is a reality -- she's become trapped in the body of Rob Schneider -- in this shape-shifting comedy. Jessica (Rachel McAdams) is a beautiful teenager whose life would be the envy of any high school student -- she's head of the cheerleading squad, her boyfriend, Billy (Matthew Lawrence), is the quarterback of the football team, and she's pretty and popular enough to get nearly anyone to do what she wants. However, Jessica is soon to find out how the other half lives, in more ways than she counted upon; she shoplifts a pair of earrings from an shop specializing in African curios run by Mambuza (Angie Stone), unaware that they carry the curse of Princess Nawa. Thanks to the curse, the next morning Jessica awakes to find that her spirit has entered the body of Clive (Rob Schneider), a sweaty and hirsute small-time crook. As Jessica tries to figure out how she can return to her old body, she has to lead the cheerleading squad to victory and attend her senior prom while looking like a less-than-handsome 30-year-old man. Billy is understandably puzzled by the changes in Jessica, while her best friend, April (Anna Faris), finds her feelings about Jessica change a bit once she volunteers to be her prom date. The Hot Chick is the first theatrical feature for director Tom Brady; Brady co-wrote an earlier Schneider vehicle, The Animal, and was on the writing staff for his television series Men Behaving Badly(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Based on the Saturday Night Live sketch of the same name, Wayne's World is a wacky, irreverent pop-culture comedy about the adventures of two amiably aimless metal-head friends, Wayne (Mike Myers) and Garth (Dana Carvey). From Wayne's basement, the pair broadcast a talk-show called "Wayne's World" on local public access television. The show comes to the attention of a sleazy network executive (Rob Lowe) who wants to produce a big-budget version of "Wayne's World"--and he also wants Wayne's girlfriend, a rock singer named Cassandra (Tia Carrere). Wayne and Garth have to battle the executive not only to save their show, but also Cassandra. Director Penelope Spheeris, Myers and Carvey hang a lot of silly, but funny, jokes on this thin plot, and the energy of the cast--as well as the wild pop-culture references--make Wayne's World a cut above the average Saturday Night Live spin-off movie(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">All the King's Men</title>
    <desc lang="en">The legacy of a populist Southern politician whose lofty ambitions for the future leave him open to corruption and scandal is detailed as author Robert Penn Warren's thinly veiled portrait of Depression-era Louisiana governor Huey Long comes to the screen -- again -- this time courtesy of director and screenwriter Steven Zaillian. Willie Stark (Sean Penn) is a man of the people, and for the people; at least that's what he tells the people. Propelled into a race for governor by opposing forces looking to split the "hick vote," Stark is convinced by a handler -- as well as by young journalist Jack Burden (Jude Law) -- to not kowtow to the powers that be. His rhetoric grows fiery, and he makes his way into office on a not-so-solid foundation of social-service promises. When idealism gives way to the harsh realities of the time, however, the fast-talking politico is quick to discover just how far one can fall when ambition and power lead to a betrayal of one's original motivations. Kate Winslet, Patricia Clarkson, James Gandolfini, Mark Ruffalo, and Anthony Hopkins round out an all-star cast in this second version of Warren's Pulitzer Prize-winning 1947 novel; the first won a parade of Oscars after its release in 1949(n)</desc>

Bond is dispatched to the States to stem the activities of Mr. Big (Yaphet Kotto), who plans to take over the Western Hemisphere by converting everyone into heroin addicts. The woman in the case is Solitaire (Jane Seymour in her movie debut), an enigmatic interpreter of tarot cards. The obligatory destructive-chase sequence occurs at the film's midpoint, with Bond being chased in a motorboat by Mr. Big's henchmen, slashing his way through the marshlands and smashing up a wedding party. Clifton James makes the first of several Bond appearances as redneck sheriff Pepper, while Geoffrey Holder is an enthusiastic secondary villain.

    <title lang="en">Stage Beauty</title>
    <desc lang="en">The true story of two performers whose careers were changed forever by a shift in gender roles on the British stage comes to the screen in this adaptation of the play +Compleat Female Stage Beauty by Jeffrey Hatcher. In London, in the latter half of the 17th century, Ned Kynaston (Billy Crudup) is a noted star of the legitimate theater with an unusual specialty -- at a time when it was considered unseemly for women to work as thespians, Kynaston specialized in female roles, and was described by one writer as the most beautiful woman on the London stage. With the help of his faithful dresser, Maria Hughes (Claire Danes), Kynaston can turn himself into a striking actress in front of the footlights, and is starring opposite Thomas Betterton (Tom Wilkinson) in a production of Shakespeare's +Othello when, while still in costume after a performance, he is propositioned by theatrical impresario Sir Charles Sedley (Richard Griffiths). The sexually open-minded Sedley isn't discouraged to learn Kynaston is a man, but he is bitterly angered by the actor's flip rejection of his advances. Sedley takes revenge against Kynaston by hiring a gang of criminals to beat him up. With Betterton's production of +Othello closed while the leading "lady" recuperates, Hughes sees an opportunity and stages an underground version of the play, casting herself as Desdemona. While she lacks Kynaston's dramatic skills, the daring of her appearance on-stage creates a sensation, and King Charles II (Rupert Everett), a noted theater buff, is so taken with Hughes that he declares women should play women from now on. But as Hughes' star rises, Kynaston's quickly falls, and he becomes a bitter, forgotten man. When the novelty of Hughes' gender wears off and her failings as an thespian become obvious, she turns to her former friend Kynaston, hoping he can teach her to be as good an actress as he was. Stage Beauty's supporting cast includes Ben Chaplin, Edward Fox, and Hugh Bonneville(n)</desc>

Rebecca's brother Tobey, (Billy Crudup), is in a more openly dysfunctional relationship; he's been dating Elaine (Maggie Gyllenhaal) for seven years but has no interest in marriage, while she's desperate to settle down and start a family. Tobey and Elaine decide to call it quits, as Tobey hooks up with an old friend from college (Eva Mendes) who is looking to cheat on her husband, and Elaine starts dating a handsome musician (James LeGros) who may be in need of a green card. Meanwhile, Rebecca and Tom go into couples therapy, which creates as many problems as it solves. Trust the Man also features Ellen Barkin, Garry Shandling, and Bob Balaban(n)</desc>

As they compare notes on the man they've been unknowingly sharing and what they should do about the situation, Blake arrives and quickly starts trying to talk his way out of the disastrous situation. Writer and director James Toback claims he was inspired to write this project for Robert Downey Jr. after seeing a news report showing him in jail after violating parole regarding an arrest for drugs; Two Girls and a Guy was written in four days and shot in eleven days on a single set, and features excellent performances from Downey, Graham, and Wagner(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Cloak and Dagger</title>
    <desc lang="en">Juvenile actor Henry Thomas, late of E.T., is the star of Cloak and Dagger. Given to telling whoppers, Thomas finds himself in a boy-who-cried-wolf dilemma when he overhears two spies plotting to smuggle valuable info out of the US. When he can't get his own father Dabney Coleman to believe him, Thomas turns disconsolately to a computer game called "Cloak and Dagger" and begins to fantasize, imagining that he is in cahoots with secret agent Jack Flack, also played by Coleman. Finally coming to grips with the fact that the mythical Jack Flack cannot help him this time, Thomas takes on the spies with the help of his schoolmates, who are also "Cloak and Dagger" addicts. Cloak and Dagger is a heavily disguised remake of 1949's The Window; both are based on the Cornell Woolrich story The Boy Cried Murder(n)</desc>

Inviting three people -- the teacher who flunked him (Katherine Squire), the military officer who courtmartialed him (Trevor Bardette), the minister who condemned him from the pulpit (Gage Clarke) -- to the shelter, Radin calmly informs them that he has "inside information" that a nuclear war is about to commence, and backs up this assertion with a carefully orchestrated series of radio bulletins and air-raid sirens. Sharkishly adopting a "no hard feelings" pose, Radin offers to allow his visitors to remain in his shelter during the bombing -- but only if they will drop to their knees and "beg his pardon."

    <desc lang="en">The director (Rob Cohen) and star (Vin Diesel) of the previous summer's hit The Fast and the Furious (2001) are reunited for this spy thriller billed as a next-generation James Bond adventure. Diesel stars as Xander Cage, a nihilist extreme sports enthusiast nicknamed "Triple X" because of a large tattoo covering his back and neck. Cage's illegal stunts and poor attitude (he's given to spouting dialogue such as, "Have you ever been punched in the face for talking too much?") land him in jail, where he's recruited/blackmailed into government service by the National Security Agency's Augustus Gibbons, who likes Cage for his skills and expendability. The new secret agent is assigned to infiltrate a Russian crime ring called Anarchy 99, whose access to biochemical weaponry is making the United States extremely nervous. With the help of some high-tech gadgets from weapons master Toby Lee Shavers (Michael Roof), Cage is able to make his way into Anarchy 99, where he targets the group's leader Yorgi (Marton Csokas) and falls for the organization's second-in-command, Yelena (Asia Argento). XXX (2002) is the first in a hoped-for franchise of sequels for the film's producer, Revolution Studios(n)</desc>

Although it was not the last episode shot for the show's fifth season -- that would be "The Hamptons," which aired second to last -- it makes sense that "The Opposite" aired last, as several turns of events set the stage for the sixth season. It all starts with George deciding to do the opposite of everything he would normally do. Once he puts the plan into action, the perennial loser suddenly sees things going well for himself. He gets a girlfriend, a job with the Yankees, and finally moves out of his parents house. Meanwhile, Jerry realizes that his luck is "even Steven," Kramer appears on Live! With Regis and Kathy Lee to promote his coffee-table book about coffee tables, and Elaine suddenly can't win, leading her to believe that she has switched places with George. Originally airing May 19, 1994, the fifth-season closer guest starred 3rd Rock From the Sun's French Stewart and featured the first appearance of the faceless George Steinbrenner, voiced by co-creator Larry David(n)</desc>
