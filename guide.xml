    <title lang="en">The Arrival</title>
    <desc lang="en">They have been saying for years that the Greenhouse Effect is going to destroy the planet. For years humans have blamed themselves for spewing climate-changing gasses into our fragile atmosphere. But are we as guilty as we think we are or are there more sinister forces at work? Paying tribute to an old-fashioned '50s style paranoid (the aliens have come to take over the planet) sci-fi low-budget thriller, this film gives a chilling answer to that question. It begins with the scene of a young woman picking poppies in a verdant field. She is obviously puzzled and as the camera pulls away it becomes clear why. The story then jumps to a California observatory where nerdish radio telescope operator Zane Ziminski is suddenly jarred from the boredom of monitoring random space noises by a strangely regular series of unearthly blips that he is convinced come from an alien galaxy and for some reason are being deliberately beamed to Earth. Excitedly he takes the recorded evidence to his boss, who promptly fires him. Convinced that the aliens were transmitting messages to aliens already on our planet, Ziminski quickly builds a make-shift radio telescope and high tech computer system in his garage so he can pinpoit the destination of the singles. This leads him to an isolated Mexican village where he and another scientist (the lady from the poppy field), who has drawn similar conclusions, team up and go alien-hunting. They don't hunt long, for the villagers turn out to be mighty strange people. From there it is only a short time before they find the underground alien lair where they learn that the invaders' home planet is dying and that they are planning to "terraform" the Earth in preparation of colonizing it. Part of the process involves deliberately accelerating the Greenhouse effect. The special effects are well-done and refreshingly, they are not overpowering(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">For the second time in her career, Julia Stiles plays a character romancing the Crown Prince of Denmark in The Prince &amp; Me, a romantic wish-fulfillment fantasy from director Martha Coolidge. Far from her role as Ophelia in 2000's Hamlet, however, Stiles plays Paige, a plucky, determined college student from the Midwest who's buried in her last few semesters of pre-med studies when she meets Eddie, a brash, impudent Danish foreign-exchange student who just happens to have a mysterious partner (Ben Miller) shadowing him in everything he does. What Paige doesn't know is that Eddie is in fact the spoiled son of the King (James Fox) and Queen (Miranda Richardson) of Denmark, on holiday in America hoping to find a nonstop keg party complete with buxom American babes. What he and his butler don't count on is squalid dorm life, final exams, and the possibility that Eddie might actually find his true soul mate in the sensible Paige. But when Eddie finally reveals his secret, will Paige want to give up her dreams of becoming a doctor for a playboy prince?(n)</desc>

Adding to the pressure, the diners are all experts in the fish industry, so expectations will be high. The diners' two most popular contestants are exempt from the studio cook-off, which sees the rest creating one last dish in a bid to stay in the competition.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The World Health Organisation has called stress the `health epidemic of the 21st century', and it has been blamed for contributing to illnesses such as diabetes, dementia and types of cancer. Here, Fiona Phillips explores scientific research into stress and demonstrates a number of techniques designed to decrease common factors. She also investigates whether it is inherently a bad thing, joining a number of volunteers who put themselves into a number of high-stress situations to truly understand its meaning and how people could use it to their advantage.(n)</desc>

In the 100th episode of the genealogy show, Twiggy examines her family's past, where she discovers a history involving strong women and a hint of crime.(n)</desc>

However, Britain still had a powerful navy and some of the finest fighter planes ever built and had also made two powerful technological breakthroughs - radar and the cracking of the German Enigma codes - that would give it a vital edge in the Battle of Britain. Prime minister Winston Churchill then began the fightback, with commando raids and help for the resistance in occupied Europe.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">By the end of June 1940, German forces controlled Denmark, Norway, Holland, Belgium and France, with Britain defiant but bloodied after the retreat from Dunkirk and in no state to take on the all-conquering Nazi war machine. However, Britain still had a powerful navy and some of the finest fighter planes ever built and had also made two powerful technological breakthroughs - radar and the cracking of the German Enigma codes - that would give it a vital edge in the Battle of Britain. Prime minister Winston Churchill then began the fightback, with commando raids and help for the resistance in occupied Europe.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">I, Robot</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Alex Proyas (Dark City, The Crow) helmed this sci-fi thriller inspired by the stories in Isaac Asimov's nine-story anthology of the same name. In the future presented in the film, humans have become exceedingly dependent on robots in their everyday lives. Robots have become more and more advanced, but each one is preprogrammed to always obey humans and to, under no circumstances, ever harm a human. So, when a scientist turns up dead and a humanoid robot is the main suspect, the world is left to wonder if they are as safe around their electronic servants as previously thought. Will Smith stars as Del Spooner, the robot-hating Chicago cop assigned to the murder investigation. Bridget Moynahan, Bruce Greenwood, James Cromwell, and Chi McBride also star(n)</desc>

Jack Lemmon is John Gustafson, an ice-fishing Minnesota native who has been feuding with his neighbor and former best friend Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) for decades. The battle of wills between John and Max is characterized by crude name calling and harmless practical jokes. Max is unaware that John is having serious problems, chiefly that his daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah) is experiencing marital woes and that his house is about to be confiscated by an officious IRS agent (Buck Henry). When it seems that John and Max may finally put aside their childish rivalry, however, sexy new neighbor Ariel (Ann-Margret) arrives and dates both men, pitting them against each other more fiercely than ever before. Despite their mutual loathing, the death of a friend, John's problems, and a budding romance between Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) and Melanie may force the two old friends to reconcile(n)</desc>

Jack Lemmon is John Gustafson, an ice-fishing Minnesota native who has been feuding with his neighbor and former best friend Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) for decades. The battle of wills between John and Max is characterized by crude name calling and harmless practical jokes. Max is unaware that John is having serious problems, chiefly that his daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah) is experiencing marital woes and that his house is about to be confiscated by an officious IRS agent (Buck Henry). When it seems that John and Max may finally put aside their childish rivalry, however, sexy new neighbor Ariel (Ann-Margret) arrives and dates both men, pitting them against each other more fiercely than ever before. Despite their mutual loathing, the death of a friend, John's problems, and a budding romance between Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) and Melanie may force the two old friends to reconcile(n)</desc>

As the story begins, the two pensioners have become grudging pals, content to suspend their constant practical jokes as their children prepare to marry each other. They still enjoy taunting each other at their favorite fishing lake. The fireworks really begin when they learn that the gorgeous and plucky Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) and her Italian mother have bought their beloved bait shop and plan to turn it into an Italian restaurant. The two devious fellows, hating the idea that anything should change in Wabasha, Minnesota, team up to keep that restaurant from opening, but Maria is having none of that nonsense and stands her ground. In the face of such feistiness, it is small wonder that Goldman finds himself falling in love, but will he succeed in subduing the equally stubborn Maria? Will he and Gustafson manage to maintain their tentative détente?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In Kirk demicco's animated film three supersonic simian spacemen take to the cosmos to find a missing probe, and encounter a whole world of trouble along the way. Ham III, grandson of the first chimp in space, is a wise-cracking smart aleck who makes a living being fired from a cannon. When the Infinity Space Probe goes missing, Ham joins a mission to find it. Although he has been recruited as a PR stunt, his fellow Space Chimps are highly trained experts Luna and Titan. When the three crash-land on the planet Malgor, they find a race of aliens who are being oppressed by the tyrannical Zartog, who is using the probe for his own nefarious ends. It falls to the feckless Ham to save the day, using his circus skills to help liberate the aliens, recover the probe, get the girl, and secure passage home. This is great fare for all the family, with plenty of deadpan asides to keep grown-ups entertained. The cast also includes Stanley Tucci, and two names Glee devotees will recognise Jane Lynch and Kristin Chenoweth(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">If you could talk to the child that you used to be, what advice would you give him? That question forms the basis of this comic fantasy. Forty-year-old Russ Duritz (Bruce Willis) is a wealthy and powerful "image consultant" who has made a career out of telling people how to present themselves. But while he's a success in business, he's a failure in life; he's vain, mean-spirited, and hasn't been able to hold onto a marriage (or even a pet dog). One day, Russ is startled to meet Rusty (Spencer Breslin), a stocky kid whom he soon realizes is himself at the age of eight, having passed through a wrinkle in time. Young Rusty doesn't seem much happier than the grown-up Russ, so the older man takes his younger self under his wing and tries to teach him how to avoid the mistakes he's made, while Rusty encourages Russ to be a more caring human being. Along the way, Russ and Rusty become friends, and realize how much they can learn from each other. Disney's The Kid also stars Jean Smart as one of Russ' clients, Lily Tomlin as his assistant, and Daniel Von Bargen as his father(n)</desc>

The apartment just gets better when he meets his new neighbor, Lila (Sophie Marceau), a very beautiful women who has recently come to the United States from France. However, Lila has just gotten out of a bad relationship with René (Patrick Bruel), who doesn't want to leave her alone, so she has little interest in romance, preferring to devote herself to her cello and her dog Jack. One day, Jack runs away and Dylan finds him; when he returns the pooch to Lila, it's the first time she's been willing to speak in full sentences to him, though not for very long. Faster than you can say "That idea is so crazy it just might work!", Dylan decides to kidnap Jack; when Lila thinks the dog is lost, Dylan will generously volunteer to help look for him, which will give Dylan a chance to impress Lila when he's able to find Jack so quickly. Sure enough, Dylan swipes the dog, but from that point on the plan hardly goes the way he had hoped. Star David Spade also co-wrote the screenplay with J.B.

It also hinges around Fingerling's obsession with the number 23 - a prime number that seems to pop up everywhere in the universe once you start to notice it.

    <title lang="en">The Kid Stays in the Picture</title>
    <desc lang="en">Robert Evans' rise from second-string actor (who really was discovered while lounging by the pool at the Beverly Hills Hotel) to head of one of Hollywood's biggest movie studios is told from the viewpoint of Evans himself in this documentary, adapted from his autobiography (and featuring Evans' own narration). In 1957, Evans had already achieved success in the garment business when actress Norma Shearer spotting him at poolside and suggested he should play her late husband, legendary producer Irving Thalberg, in the movie Man of a Thousand Faces. While Evans knew he wasn't cut out to be an actor, he discovered he liked the movie business, and after becoming a film industry executive, Evans was named head of production at Paramount in the late '60s. Under Evans' leadership, Paramount produced such classics as Rosemary's Baby, Love Story, and The Godfather. He also married actress Ali McGraw; however, McGraw left Evans for Steve McQueen after they starred together in The Getaway. After leaving Paramount to become a producer (and racking up hits like Chinatown and Marathon Man), Evans' golden touch began to elude him; an arrest for drugs seemed to put an end to his career, until he made a comeback as a freelance producer in the 1990s on such films as Sliver and The Saint. Part of the narration for The Kid Stays in the Picture was drawn from the book-on-tape version of Robert Evans' autobiography of the same name, which featured Evans reading his own work; the audio book has developed a cult following of its own, and legend has it Dustin Hoffman based his performance in Wag The Dog on Evans' reading style on the tape(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">A Serious Man</title>
    <desc lang="en">Filmmaking duo Joel and Ethan Coen write, produce, and direct this period black comedy set in 1967 concerning a Midwestern physics professor whose staid and stable life slowly begins to unravel after his wife announces that she's leaving him. As if the failure of his longtime marriage wasn't enough for Larry Gopnik (Tony-nominated Michael Stuhlbarg) to contend with, now his socially inept brother refuses to move out of the house as well. Larry is a modest man of science. Up to this point, his life has been uneventful at best, but things are about to get interesting. When his wife, Judith, announces that she is leaving him to move in with his smug colleague Sy Ableman, Larry does his best to contend with his failed marriage while barely tolerating his unemployable brother, Arthur, who appears to have grown roots on Larry's couch. Meanwhile, Larry's son, Danny, is getting into trouble at Hebrew school, and his daughter, Sarah, is stealthily snatching money from his wallet so she can afford a nose job. As Judith and Sy merrily begin making plans for their new life of domestic bliss together, Larry begins receiving a series of anonymous letters from someone who seems intent on sabotaging his chance for tenure at the university. To further complicate matters, a graduate student with failing grades is attempting to bribe the professor while simultaneously threatening him with a defamation lawsuit. Larry is in some serious need of equilibrium, though it's hard to focus on getting your life in order when your beautiful neighbor insists on sunbathing in the nude just outside your window. Perhaps by seeking the advice of three trusted rabbis, Larry can finally learn to cope with his afflictions and become a genuine mensch. A Serious Man is the second in a two-picture deal that the siblings made with Focus Features and Working Title. The first film in the deal, entitled Burn After Reading and starring Brad Pitt, George Clooney, and Frances McDormand, was released nationwide in September 2008(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Happening</title>
    <desc lang="en">Lady in the Water director M. Night Shyamalan puts PG-13 suspense on pause to tell this grim apocalyptic tale about a family fleeing a natural disaster that poses a grave threat to the whole of humanity. Philadelphia high-school science teacher Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) is discussing the disappearance of the bees with his students when the staff is summoned to the theater and briefed about a mysterious event that is currently unfolding in New York City. According to reports, citizens in the vicinity of Central Park have suddenly and inexplicably begun seizing up just before killing themselves by whatever means are at their disposal. As the phenomena begins to spread and talk of terrorism fills the airwaves, Elliot, his wife, Alma (Zooey Deschanel), their friend Julian (John Leguizamo), and his daughter, Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez), board a train bound for the presumed safety of the country. When the train screeches to a halt before arriving at its final destination, however, the frightened passengers are forced to fend for themselves as each consecutive news report paints an increasingly grim picture of the situation in more urbanized areas. Theories abound on what could be causing the unexplainable rash of suicides, but the only thing that everyone seems to agree on is that it's some kind of airborne contagion that is carried in the wind. It would appear that humankind's reign on planet Earth has come to an end, but perhaps if this small band of survivors can find a safe place to lie low until this all blows over, all hope for survival of the species might not be lost just yet(n)</desc>

Sabich, a successful prosecutor, whose marriage is shaken by his wife Barbara's (Bonnie Bedelia) discovery of his affair, finds himself in a nightmare when his former mistress is found dead and all the physical evidence points to him; even his wife seems to believe that he is guilty. Ford is excellent in his role as Sabich, convincing both as an attorney and as a man who wants to take his formerly happy life back. Bonnie Bedelia is wonderful as Sabich's unforgiving wife, and gives a compelling, enigmatic performance in a difficult role. Presumed Innocent both a plausible, believable courtroom drama and an exciting murder mystery is highly recommended(n)</desc>

The situation reaches a disastrous peak when Betsy and Bridget take it upon themselves to arrange the couple's Catalina Island wedding--and as terrifying as these two ladies are when they're on opposite sides of the fence, they're even more so when they join forces! Falling in Love with the Girl Next Door was first telecast February 4, 2006, as a cinematic Valentine card from cable's Hallmark Channel(n)</desc>

In the fifth-season opener of Murder She Wrote, mystery writer and amateur sleuth Jessica Fletcher (Angela Lansbury), who has sent so many murderers to prison in the past, finds herself behind bars with a murder rap hanging over her head. Naturally, Jessica is innocent: she merely witnessed the assassination of a Bulgarian spy. Even so, is locked up as the Number One Suspect--but it's actually a clever ruse concocted by Jessica's nephew Grady (Michael Horton) and redoubtable British secret agent Haggerty (Len Cariou) to keep our heroine out of harm's way so that they can hunt down the actual miscreant(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin star in Ruben Fleischer's very silly and gratuitously gory comedy, an everyday tale of strangers thrown together by the need to find sanctuary from flesh-eating hordes. The hordes in question were, until recently, human US citizens, but a global pandemic has transmogrified them into the shuffling, ravenous undead. Each of our heroic quartet is known only by the name of the town to which they're heading. Columbus, the movie's narrator, is a detail-obsessed introvert who has developed a seemingly endless checklist to avoid becoming a meal; Tallahassee is Columbus's polar opposite - rough and impetuous, he dispatches the undead with a gung-ho glee. After a tricky start, the duo team up and then let sisters Wichita and Little Rock join them. Their journey across the states takes in a Californian theme park and a visit to the home of a Hollywood star, but mainly it's an excuse for the four leads to off as many zombies as inventively, amusingly and bloodily as possible..(n)</desc>

The prophecies of the Bible have come to pass, and as a billion people vanish from the face of the Earth, the rest of humanity contends with taunting demons and showers of blood. Meanwhile, the Beast arrives in Seattle to stake his clam on this godforsaken planet. He's got eyes for Lindsey, who isn't about to exchange vows with Beelzebub. If Ben and Lindsey can just figure out a way to lock up the Beast for 1000 years, perhaps they'll be able to save the entire world from a fate worse than death. They won't be able to do it alone, but perhaps with the help of Lindsey's family and a few devoted friends, this unassuming couple will find a way to rid the world of the Antichrist and make life for the damned a little less miserable.

Calves are disappearing into the night and Brady's old friend Lee Lightsey can't determine what's taking them. The list of predators is long in Florida: black bear, Florida panther, coyotes, and gators. Brady must put the clues together and find the killer before it strikes again. But nothing in Brady's long career can prepare him for what is next. An epic encounter with a giant gator. Armed only with what he finds in his car, and the help of his willing cameraman, Brady attempts to capture the rouge gator and prove that it is behind the calf killings(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Nick Knowles and his crack team of builders, plasterers and electricians come to the aid of Frank and Christine Burrows in Wigan, Greater Manchester. In 2012, the Burrows' 35-year-old son Mark retrained as a scaffolder to follow in his father's footsteps, but was paralysed as the result of an unprovoked attack that left him with severe brain damage. Mark now needs constant care, but the Burrows' family home is not yet fit for purpose, so Frank and Christine have been forced to take their son to a care home 15 miles away. With the help of flamboyant designer Laurence Llewelyn Bowen, Nick's experts set about constructing a self-contained apartment alongside the Burrows' two-bedroom bungalow, which will provide Nick with the space, independence and security he will need to return home for good after spending two years away.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Nick Knowles comes to the aid of Liz and Jason Liversidge, a Hull couple in desperate need of help in future-proofing their family home. Not long after getting married and starting a family, Jason was diagnosed with both Fabrys disease, which causes a build-up of poisonous toxins in the body, and Motor Neurone Disease, which drastically reduced his life expectancy. The pair also discovered that Jason would have passed Fabrys disease on to his two daughters, which means that once her husband is gone, Liz will need all the help she can get in managing her children's condition. Nick joins forces with designer Oliver Heath and an army of volunteers to put together a home in which Jason can build meaningful memories with his girls, but one which also gives Liz the best chance of providing for their future needs.(n)</desc>

Ricardo Tubbs (Jamie Foxx) and Sonny Crockett (Colin Farrell) are two police detectives working undercover in Florida; Tubbs is smart, cool, and resourceful, while Crockett has his own way of doing things, though he stays close enough to the rules to stay out of trouble. Their latest assignment is to get the goods on Arcangel de Jesus Montoya (Luis Tosar), a local drug kingpin whose men are believed to be responsible for a handful of recent murders. In order to infiltrate Montoya's operation, Tubbs and Crockett pose as powerboat racers willing to use their talents to pilot drug-smuggling ships for the right price. The detectives' ruse works, but as they dig deeper into Montoya's inner circle, they become involved in a dangerous operation that will take them to Haiti and Cuba, where neither the Miami Police Force nor the United States government can help them if things go wrong. Crockett also begins walking a risky path when he begins an affair with Isabella (Gong Li), a woman high up in Montoya's organization.

    <title lang="en">The Straight Story</title>
    <desc lang="en">David Lynch offers an uncharacteristically straightforward and warmly sentimental approach to his material in this film, based on a true story, about an elderly man's journey to reconcile with his brother. Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) is an ailing widower in his early 70's who lives in Laurens, Iowa with his daughter, Rose (Sissy Spacek), who is mildly retarded and has a speech defect. Alvin doesn't trust doctors, despite suffering from emphysema and a bad hip. Alvin learns that his brother Lyle (Harry Dean Stanton) has suffered a stroke and may not have long to live. Alvin and Lyle haven't spoken in 10 years, which Alvin says is mainly a matter of pride and alcohol; Alvin wants to clear his slate with his brother before it's too late. However, Lyle lives in Wisconsin, and Alvin has little money, no car, and no driver's license. He does, however, have a riding lawn mower, and so Alvin hops on board and heads northeast to Wisconsin, hoping to make it while there's still time. Along the way, Alvin makes new friends and refuses to give up on his journey, despite frequent mechanical breakdowns. Richard Farnsworth's performance as Alvin earned him an Academy Award nomination as Best Actor; it would prove to be his final screen appearance, as he died a year after the film's release(n)</desc>

The glimmer of a better life always just out of reach, Russell Baze (Christian Bale) dreams of starting a family with his girlfriend Lena (Zoe Saldana), and resolves to earn an honest living working in the same mill where his dying father did. Meanwhile, Russell's volatile younger brother Rodney (Casey Affleck) decides to serve his country by fighting in Iraq. Despite Russell's best intentions, however, his future starts to look grim when he is sent to prison following a deadly drunk-driving accident; at the same time, Rodney begins competing in illegal fights for local bar owner John Petty (Willem Dafoe), who owes a sizable debt to the very dangerous Harlan DeGroat (Woody Harrelson), a fight organizer/meth dealer who's way too into his own product. Later, after Russell is released from prison having missed his father's funeral, he is heartbroken to learn that Lena has become seriously involved with the local police chief, Wesley Barnes (Forest Whitaker). But heartache turns to anger when the desperate Rodney also gets mixed up with DeGroat, and winds up dead along with John Petty. Informed by Chief Barnes that Rodney's body has been found by a hunter, Russell, believing he has nothing to lose, recruits his loyal uncle Red (Sam Shepard) to help him seek revenge(n)</desc>

Ricardo Tubbs (Jamie Foxx) and Sonny Crockett (Colin Farrell) are two police detectives working undercover in Florida; Tubbs is smart, cool, and resourceful, while Crockett has his own way of doing things, though he stays close enough to the rules to stay out of trouble. Their latest assignment is to get the goods on Arcangel de Jesus Montoya (Luis Tosar), a local drug kingpin whose men are believed to be responsible for a handful of recent murders. In order to infiltrate Montoya's operation, Tubbs and Crockett pose as powerboat racers willing to use their talents to pilot drug-smuggling ships for the right price. The detectives' ruse works, but as they dig deeper into Montoya's inner circle, they become involved in a dangerous operation that will take them to Haiti and Cuba, where neither the Miami Police Force nor the United States government can help them if things go wrong. Crockett also begins walking a risky path when he begins an affair with Isabella (Gong Li), a woman high up in Montoya's organization.

    <title lang="en">The Straight Story</title>
    <desc lang="en">David Lynch offers an uncharacteristically straightforward and warmly sentimental approach to his material in this film, based on a true story, about an elderly man's journey to reconcile with his brother. Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) is an ailing widower in his early 70's who lives in Laurens, Iowa with his daughter, Rose (Sissy Spacek), who is mildly retarded and has a speech defect. Alvin doesn't trust doctors, despite suffering from emphysema and a bad hip. Alvin learns that his brother Lyle (Harry Dean Stanton) has suffered a stroke and may not have long to live. Alvin and Lyle haven't spoken in 10 years, which Alvin says is mainly a matter of pride and alcohol; Alvin wants to clear his slate with his brother before it's too late. However, Lyle lives in Wisconsin, and Alvin has little money, no car, and no driver's license. He does, however, have a riding lawn mower, and so Alvin hops on board and heads northeast to Wisconsin, hoping to make it while there's still time. Along the way, Alvin makes new friends and refuses to give up on his journey, despite frequent mechanical breakdowns. Richard Farnsworth's performance as Alvin earned him an Academy Award nomination as Best Actor; it would prove to be his final screen appearance, as he died a year after the film's release(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Award-winning short filmmaker Jessica Sharzer makes her feature debut with the teen drama Speak, based on the young-adult novel by Laurie Halse Anderson. Kristen Stewart stars as high school freshman Melinda, who has lost her ability to speak. Ever since a traumatic event that occurred at a party over the summer, she has chosen to remain silent. She's abandoned by her friends, while her mother Joyce (Elizabeth Perkins) is too wrapped up in her own problems to notice. By recalling the details of the past situation, it becomes clear that a date rape occurred. Yet no one has offered her support in order to deal with the psychological consequences. Eventually her art teacher Mr. Freeman (Steve Zahn) reaches out, helping her develop ways to express herself. Also starring Hallee Hirsh and Eric Lively. Speak premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2004 as part of the American Spectrum competition(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A hardened detective enters into a tenuous symbiotic relationship with the vicious serial killer she is tracking after earning the respect of the murderous madman in this vicious psychological thriller starring Demi Moore, Kevin Costner, and William Hurt. Earl Brooks (Costner) is a successful businessman, noted philanthropist, and loving father. He's the kind of man whom no one would ever suspect of being a notorious serial killer, but then again history's most dubious psychopaths are often the quiet neighbor whom no one would ever suspect was capable of committing such unspeakable atrocities. Until now, no one has had any reason to link Earl Brooks with the heinous crimes of the dreaded Thumbprint Killer. Even his beautiful wife (Marg Helgenbeger) and teenage daughter (Danielle Panabaker) could never conceive of such an awful truth. But when Mr. Brooks's dark side begins to outshine his sane exterior, an amateur photographer (Dane Cook) captures the killer succumbing to his murderous instinct on film. Now, as Mr. Brooks is pursued by tenacious detective Tracy Atwood (Moore) and forced to bend to the will of an opportunistic bystander, the killer who was once able to keep his murderous alter ego (Hurt) in check finds his control steadily slipping(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Natural</title>
    <desc lang="en">The film version of The Natural pulls off the neat trick of conveying the spirit of the Bernard Malamud novel upon which it is based, even while changing both the outcome and the meaning of Malamud's closing chapters. In his first film appearance in four years, Robert Redford plays Roy Hobbs, a farm boy with a hankering to be a great baseball player. With his faithful homemade bat "Wonderboy" in hand, Roy heads to the big city. En route, he arouses the fascination of the mysterious Harriet Bird (Barbara Hershey). Luring the boy to a hotel room, Harriet asks Roy what he wants out of life. Roy brashly responds he wants to be "the best there is," whereupon Harriet whips out a gun and shoots Roy down. Sixteen years later, a humbler Roy Hobbs emerges from the bush leagues to become a 35-year-old "rookie" on the 1939 lineup of the New York Knights. He soon becomes the team's star player, and in so doing once more attracts enigmatic woman Memo Paris (Kim Basinger), the glamorous niece of the Knights' manager Pop Fisher (Wilford Brimley) and the mistress of Rothstein-like gambler Gus Sands (a curiously unbilled Darren McGavin). Roy's fascination with Memo compromises his ability to play, but this time he finds salvation in the form the angelic Iris Gaines (Glenn Close), his childhood sweetheart. From this point forward, the script for The Natural bears very little resemblance to the Malamud original. Without giving anything away, it can be said that Roy Hobbs is given a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to compensate for the mistakes of his youth, despite the demonic intrusion of inexplicably spiteful sports writer Max Mercy (Robert Duvall). The Natural elevates the art of slow-motion photography to new heights; while this technique would become precious and boring in later baseball films, it works beautifully here, as does the decision by director Barry Levinson and cinematographer Caleb Deschanel to convey the symbolism inherent in the story in purely visual rather than blatantly verbal terms. (If the characters told you that the story was a retelling of the Camelot legend in baseball terms, would you have watched?) Another plus is the pastoral theme music by Randy Newman, which has been well utilized on sports broadcasts and "human interest" TV documentaries ever since. The baseball scenes in The Natural were staged at War Memorial Stadium in Buffalo, New York(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</title>
    <desc lang="en">Terry Gilliam (Brazil, Twelve Monkeys, The Fisher King) directed this colorful, stylized, pseudo-psychedelic $21-million adaptation of the 1971 Hunter S. Thompson classic, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey into the Heart of the American Dream, about stoned sportswriter Raoul Duke, Thompson's alter ego, on a wild drug-crazed road trip, a paranoid plummet into the belly of the beast, with his pal, lawyer Oscar Zeta Acosta. Originally serialized in Rolling Stone (November 1971), the book catapulted Thompson headfirst toward the Kerouac-Mailer-Capote pantheon and jump-started the entire movement of "gonzo journalism." Carrying a suitcase of drugs, Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp with shaved pate) and his attorney Dr. Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro) drive a red convertible across the Mojave from L.A. to Vegas, where Duke has an assignment to cover the Mint 400 desert motorcycle race. As the drugs kick in, Duke ventures into voiceover, filling in the blank spots and narrative gaps. "This is not a good town for psychedelic drugs," says Duke, but even so, they consume vast quantities, eventually escalating to ether. Duke notes that with ether "you can actually watch yourself behaving this terrible way, but you can't control it." The two trash their hotel room, and Gonzo goes back to L.A. Thinking the hotel room holocaust will lead to an arrest, Duke begins a drive back to L.A., but after an odd encounter with a highway patrolman (Gary Busey) and a telephone conversation with Gonzo, he returns to Vegas to cover the District Attorney Convention on Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs in the glitzy Flamingo Hotel. This time the drugged-out duo trash their Flamingo room. The crazed carnival atmosphere segues into a carney casino, Bazooko's Circus, where a barker (Penn Jillette) spiels amid aerialists, clowns, and a rotating carousel bar. Gonzo worries over runaway teen Lucy (Christina Ricci), who paints portraits of Barbra Streisand. Soon the hallucinations begin: Duke sees Gonzo transmogrify into a demon with breasts on its back, and an acid vision of a Vegas bar features large legit lounge lizards (courtesy of monster makeup man Rob Bottin). Flashbacks depicting Duke's intro to the drug scene jump back to love-Haight relationships in San Francisco's Summer of Love. Cameos and guest stars include Mark Harmon, Cameron Diaz, Flea, Lyle Lovett, Harry Dean Stanton, Ellen Barkin, Tobey Maguire, and Hunter S. Thompson himself. The film features a Geffen Records soundtrack mixing rock of the period with Vegas lounge tunes. Over the years, various script adaptations came and went as did numerous talents; people connected with past efforts to film Thompson's book include Martin Scorsese, Jack Nicholson, Dan Aykroyd, John Belushi, and writer-director Alex Cox.

Steve's uncle Gary, who is in debt to the mob, has an idea that will solve both their problems: Steve will enter and win at the Special Olympics and Gary will make a fortune betting on him. Feigning learning difficulties, Steve, now calling himself Jeffy Dahmer, joins the team, but his fellow competitors aren't fooled for a moment. Admiring his chutzpah, they keep quiet, and Jeffy also embarks on a romance with volunteer Lynn Sheridan. What could have been an exercise in poor taste rises above it because it treats the characters with both affection and respect, showing the Special Olympians as engaging and humorous individuals and largely poking fun at Gary and Steve(n)</desc>

Years after losing his wife, 62-year-old Walter Vale (Richard Jenkins) has also lost his passion for writing and teaching. In an effort to fill the empty void that his life has become, Walter makes a half-hearted attempt to learn to play classical piano. Later, when Walter's college sends him to a conference in Manhattan, he is surprised to discover that a young couple has moved into his seldom-used apartment in the city. Tarek (Haaz Sleiman) and his Senegalese girlfriend Zainab (Danai Gurira) have fallen victims to an elaborate real-estate scam, and as a result they no longer have a place to call home. When Walter reluctantly allows the couple to remain in his apartment, talented musician Tarek insists on repaying his host's kindness by teaching him to play the African drum. Over the course of Walter's lessons, the ageing academic finds his spirits revitalized while gaining a newfound appreciation for New York jazz clubs and Central Park drum circles. Later, Tarek is arrested in the subway and threatened with deportation after police learn that he is an undocumented citizen. Suddenly, in his attempt to help his new friend, Walter's passion for life is unexpectedly awakened.

    <title lang="en">Keeping Up with the Steins</title>
    <desc lang="en">The competition heats up as a young man on the cusp of adulthood in Brentwood, CA, prepares for his upcoming bar mitzvah, and his father strives to outdo the gargantuan coming-of-age bash recently thrown by his number-one nemesis, in a madcap tale of Hebrew rivalry from actor-turned-director Scott Marshall. Benjamin Fiedler (Daryl Sabara) is about to become a man, though the prospect of reciting a language he doesn't even really know in front of a temple full of strangers is so daunting that it makes him wish he could just stay a boy and write the whole thing off. As if his personal peccadilloes weren't enough to rack Benjamin's nerves, his father, Adam (Jeremy Piven), and mother, Joanne (Jami Gertz), are determined to send Benjamin into the adult world in true style. Recently, Adam's rival agent, Arnie Stein (Larry Miller), threw down the gauntlet for his own son's bar mitzvah by hosting a no-holds-barred bash that made New Year's Eve in Times Square look like cake-and-coffee day at the retirement community, and ultra-competitive Adam is determined to prove that he can top that now-legendary party. When Adam's aging, hippy-dippy father, Irwin (Garry Marshall), rolls into town in a broken-down RV with his dizzy young girlfriend, Sandy (Daryl Hannah), however, it appears as if all of his plans to out-class Arnie Stein may have been for naught(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich and Brian Cox star in this comedy action-thriller from director Robert Schwentke. Frank Moses quickly becomes all too familiar with the acronym RED - Retired, Extremely Dangerous - when his former CIA bosses send a crack squad to kill their best-ever hitman. But the extremely dangerous retiree proves more than a match for them. Realising the Agency won't give up so easily, he goes on the run and abducts, for her own safety, Sarah Ross, the pension worker he's fallen in love with over the phone. Still in the dark as to exactly why his country wants him dead, Moses sets out to find out, gathering around him a group of equally ageing-but-deadly friends and associates. Can the wily old foxes evade, overcome and/ or outgun the crème de la crème of a new generation's black ops people, led by William Cooper, to discover the truth? What follows is a non-stop onslaught of witty one-liners, gunshots and explosions... and a masterclass in knowing acting(n)</desc>

Picking up where the first film left off, Resident Evil: Apocalypse finds Alice (Milla Jovovich) still battling the living dead who are overtaking Raccoon City, inoculated with an anti-virus by the nefarious and all-powerful Umbrella Corporation (in addition to the virus itself). Alice encounters Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory), a former member of Umbrella's internal defense team. Forming an alliance with mercenary-for-hire Carlos Oliviera (Oded Fehr) and his cohorts, this tiny band of survivors seeks out Dr. Charles Ashford (Jared Harris), Umbrella's top scientist and one of the only men with the know-how to find a solution to the zombie menace; however, they discover that Ashford's cooperation comes with a price -- the scientist's daughter, Angie (Sophie Vavasseur), is missing, and he'll help Alice and her partners only if Angie is returned to him safe and sound. Resident Evil: Apocalypse was the first solo directorial credit for Alexander Witt, who previously distinguished himself as a cinematographer and second-unit director(n)</desc>
