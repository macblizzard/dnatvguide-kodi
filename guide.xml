Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) have just finished gorging themselves on savory White Castle hamburgers when they return to their apartment and hatch a plan for Harold to win the heart of his crush, Maria (Paula Garcés). Maria is going to Amsterdam, and if Harold can catch up with her overseas perhaps he can strike up a real love connection. After a close call with airport personnel and a chance encounter with Kumar's ex-girlfriend Vanessa (Danneel Harris) -- who hadn't yet told Kumar that she's engaged to be married -- the pot-loving pals finally board their flight for Amsterdam. Unfortunately for Harold, Kumar isn't able to endure the lengthy flight without an innocent puff or two from his smokeless bong. When the plane hits some turbulence and the bong is mistaken for a bomb, the flight is diverted to Guantanamo Bay and our spliff-smoking heroes are detained by overzealous Deputy Chief of Homeland Security Ron Fox (Rob Corddry). Now, if they can just escape from the world's most notorious prison compound, perhaps this hapless duo can succeed in convincing the authorities that they aren't enemy combatants, and that Kumar made the mistake of his life by letting Vanessa go. But before they can prove their innocence and get the girls, Harold and Kumar will have to outsmart the dreaded Ku Klux Klan, contend with a particularly precocious Cyclops baby, and successfully elude everyone's favorite debauched former child star -- Neil Patrick Harris(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Zorba the Greek</title>
    <desc lang="en">If ever there was a role that Anthony Quinn was born to play, it was the lusty, life-affirming title character in Zorba the Greek. The scene is the isle of Crete, where English writer Alan Bates arrives in the hopes of realigning his own values and outlook on life. He is "adopted" by the flamboyant Zorba, who determines to educate Bates in the ways of the world-or, to be more precise, Zorba's world. Along the way, Bates is introduced to widow Irene Papas, the unrequited love object of everyone on the island, who comes to a tragic end when she is accused of adultery. The writer is also a spectator to the equally benighted romance between Zorba and venerable courtesan Lila Kedrova. Other disasters follow, but Zorba is able to convince Bates that failure is an inescapable part of life, and that only by constantly tasting defeat can one truly enjoy life's victories. Based on the novel by Nikos Kazantzakis, Zorba the Greek earned Oscars for actress Lila Kedrova, cinematographer Walter Lassally and art director Vassilis Fotopoulos(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Buddy Holly: Rave On</title>
    <desc lang="en">Rock 'n' roll started with Elvis, but some believe that pop music started with Buddy Holly and the Crickets. As a songwriter, Holly revolutionised the genre by introducing dynamic new rhythms and unpredictable melodies beyond its traditional blues roots. In his songs written and recorded in the late '50s, it is already possible to hear the beat group sound of the 1960s, and beyond. This documentary tells the story of Holly's tragically short life and career through interviews with those who knew him and worked with him. Contributors include Don McLean, Paul Anka, Don Everly, Hank Marvin and Bob Harris.(n)</desc>

Although it frequently reaches full capacity - with 57 beds in 21 rooms - the pair cannot seem to turn a profit, so the expert hotelier advises them to strip back their facilities and begin charging for extra amenities. She also suggests they build on the success of their army-style boot camp by offering other self-improvement courses to their guests.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">It's the year 2054, and crime has been eradicated in Washington.

    <title lang="en">I Am Legend</title>
    <desc lang="en">Adapted from acclaimed author Richard Matheson's influential novelette of the same name, Constantine director Francis Lawrence's I Am Legend follows the last man on Earth as he struggles to survive while fending off the infected survivors of a devastating vampiric plague. A brilliant scientist who raced to discover a cure for the man-made virus as humanity came crumbling down all around him, Robert Neville (Will Smith) was inexplicably immune to the highly contagious superbug. Now the entire population of New York City -- and perhaps the world -- has been transformed into carnivorous bloodsuckers that fear the light and live solely to spread their contagion to any remaining living creature that crosses their path. It's been three years since civilization came to an end, and the loneliness has taken a devastating toll on Neville. By day he scours the city for food and supplies while sending out desperate radio messages in hopes that someone might respond, and by night he attempts to find a way to reverse the effects of the virus by experimenting with his own blood. But time is running out for Neville as the legions of infected watch his every move from the safety of the shadows, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. They, too, long to learn the secret that lurks in Neville's blood, though they will have to take caution while attempting to procure it because Neville will sooner die attempting to slay every last one of them than willingly giving up a single drop. Previously adapted for the screen in the 1964 Vincent Price frightener The Last Man on Earth and the 1971 Charlton Heston action film The Omega Man, Matheson's novelette also served as the inspiration for George A. Romero's groundbreaking zombie classic Night of the Living Dead(n)</desc>

Their three very different creations are then put to the test with a series of severe and often messy challenges.

Hitler decided to stake his last reserves on a major counter-offensive in the Ardennes region of Belgium, leading to what became known as the Battle of the Bulge. Meanwhile, Soviet troops discovered the first death camps and evidence emerged of the Nazi programme to exterminate the Jewish people.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">On a trip to the fortified Moroccan village of Ait-Ben-Haddou in the Atlas Mountains, Professor Brian Cox reveals how by watching the stars' motion across the night sky, it is quite natural for man to think he is at the centre of everything. That view was held for many ages, but innate human curiosity has eventually led to an understanding of mankind's true place in space and time, and an appreciation that Earth is not a focal point but a mere particle of rock in a possibly infinite expanse of space, 13.8 billion years from the beginning of the universe.(n)</desc>

After a botched job, they're sent by their boss Harry Waters (Ralph Fiennes) to hide out in Bruges. Ken loves the city and its history; Ray hates it, until he hooks up with beautiful drugs dealer Chloe and a mouthy dwarf actor, Jimmy. Unfortunately, just as life seems to be improving for the two hitmen, psychopathic Harry phones to deliver stark instructions: the nature of the botched hit has offended his sense of morality and he's decided to break up the partnership, ordering one of the duo to kill the other. This tests the bond linking the three men, and leads to a violent denouement in the ancient city's cobbled streets(n)</desc>

To show his appreciation, Pacelli gives Darrell a job -- serving as bodyguard for this beautiful daughter, Dolly (Emmanuelle Chriqui). A short-lived romance blooms between Darrell and Dolly, but it isn't long before the couple are quarreling, which makes Pacelli more than a bit unhappy with his new hire. However, Pacelli also has a mob war and a disloyal and ambitious young lieutenant to deal with, and Darrell soon finds Pacelli's problems become his problems too.

    <title lang="en">Cowboy Bebop: The Movie</title>
    <desc lang="en">The popular animé series Cowboy Bebop gets its own feature-length film with the aptly named Cowboy Bebop: The Movie. Set in the late 21st century, it jumps into the series' story line just prior to its conclusion, with the bounty hunting crew of the interstellar craft Bebop chasing a hacker aboard a tanker into a major city on Mars. As crew member Faye Valentine closes in on the tanker, she witnesses its catastrophic explosion, which soon appears to be a viral terrorist attack as the death toll continues to mount in the days following. Furthermore, Faye caught a glimpse of the person responsible for the blast and is thus the only surviving witness of the crime. After the government puts out a large bounty for the perpetrator's capture, the Bebop gang -- slacker Spike Spiegel, former policeman Jet Black, and hacker girl genius Edward -- begin their own hunt for the mass murderer, who is eventually revealed to be one Vincent Volaju. Vincent, it turns out, was the lone survivor of a governmental medical test and now seeks revenge by unleashing the same microscopic robotic virus used in the tanker explosion on the unsuspecting city. The Bebop crew must scramble to prevent Vincent from carrying out his plan, as well as try to locate an anti-virus to counterattack the effects of Vincent's virus. Released in both dubbed and subtitled cuts in the United States in 2003, Cowboy Bebop - The Movie premiered in Japan in 2001(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">JJ Abram's sci-fi adventure prequel, starring Chris Pine and Zacchary Quinto, uses the twin devices of a parallel timeline and time travel to boldly move the franchise in a new direction. In order to foil a Romulan attack, George Kirk sacrifices himself, having first arranged for an escape pod to take his pregnant wife to safety. Around 20 years later, the young tearaway James T Kirk is encouraged to join the Starfleet Academy by Captain Pike. At the same time, an equally youthful Spock throws in his lot with humankind and enlists with Starfleet, having had enough of the Vulcan racism directed at him due to his half-human parentage. The two recruits instantly clash. But they must overcome their differences if they are to survive a vengeful visitor from the future, who's determined to make Spock pay for his part in an atrocity that's yet to be committed... Also starring Eric Bana, Karl Urban, Simon Pegg and Winona Ryder(n)</desc>

Kate Holbrook (Fey) is a 37-year-old business executive who has always put her professional life before her personal life, but these days her biological clock is ticking louder than ever before. As with everything else she has accomplished in life, Kate is determined to have a child on her own terms. Unfortunately for Kate, the chance of her ever becoming pregnant is slim to none. Undaunted, a willful Kate drafts South Philly working-class girl Angie Ostrowiski (Poehler) -- a woman who may just be her polar opposite -- to be a surrogate mother. Subsequently informed by the head of the surrogacy center (Sigourney Weaver) that her surrogate is indeed pregnant, the excited mother-to-be soon purchases every child-rearing book she can find and excitedly begins the nesting process. But life hasn't quit throwing Kate curveballs just yet, because when a pregnant Angie shows up on her doorstep with no place to live, the woman who once thrived on order finds her life descending into chaos. Now, as Kate attempts to transform Angie into the ideal expectant mother, this odd couple will discover that families aren't always biological, but occasionally formed through friendship as well. Writer Michael McCullers, who authored the screenplays for Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and Undercover Brother in addition to working on Saturday Night Live, makes his feature directorial debut with a self-penned screenplay(n)</desc>

She was in the deadly jaws of a massive Great White shark. With deep gashes to her face and her arm almost completely severed, her friends raced to action but will they be able to save her life? Andrew was enjoying a trip to the idyllic Fraser Island with his wife when he was bitten by a snake. Andrew was sure it was a non-venomous snake and wanted to ignore it but his wife insisted they get help. What he didnt know was that the deadly venom of a Brown Snake was cursing through his veins and could very quickly stop his blood from clogging and send his organs into failure ? Young Ryan was playing outdoors when he was bitten by a Jumping Jack Ant. Within seconds, his face began to swell and his airways closed up. His mother and father rushed him to the hospital but didnt recognize the signs of anaphylactic shock(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Surfer v. Jaws. Australia is a country of vast landscapes and raw beauty, and home to some of the most venomous and deadly predators in the world. Zac was excited for a morning surfing with his older brother and mate at a remote surf break in Western Australia. It was a gray, overcast day, but the last thing on the young surfers mind was sharks until one took off his leg in a single bite. In far north Queensland, active Tom went on a pig hunting trip with his two dogs when the roles were reversed and they became the hunted... by a deadly saltwater crocodile. Finally, Duncans idyllic lifestyle living on a boat all changed when he was bitten by what he thought was a harmless mosquito. A simple mosquito bite grew into a large ulcer on his arm, and then spread to multiple sites on his body. It took months before doctors diagnosed the relentless flesh-eating bacteria as the Mycobacterium ulcerans, but by then he was at risk of losing his arm(n)</desc>

A grandmother woke in the middle of the night to discover a saltwater crocodile dragging her sons friend from his tent. With no thought for her own safety, she leapt onto its back only to be attacked herself as the croc swung around and grabbed her by the arm. Six-year-old Madison was riding her bike in suburban Perth with her grandmother when she was swooped by an Australian magpie. As she tried to escape, the bird kept chasing and attacking her. It swooped down and pecked at her eye until it popped. Ross River Fever is a mosquito borne virus that can cause a debilitating illness. Jayne didnt know why she was feeling so unwell but her symptoms left her bedridden and in agonizing pain. She was shocked to discover that one little mosquito bite could cause years of suffering(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">Da nesreća nikad ne dolazi sama, kao i da se strah javlja tamo gdje ga najmanje očekujemo, pokazuje nam ovaj zanimljivi televizijski triler o ljudima koji su spremni na sve kako bi si osigurali bolju budućnost. Budu li je uopće doživjeli. Suočen s bankrotom, kapetan ribarskog broda iz Louisiane John Sanders (Lou Diamond Phillips) se uz pomoć vjernog pomoćnika Emeryja Broussarda (Rob Boltin) odlučuje na povratak na njihov prvotni posao, potragu i crpljenje podvodnog ulja. Sandersova bivša supruga Kelli (Kristy Swanson) ponudi im velik novac za pomoć pri traženju ogromnog nalazišta pod rijekom Atchafalaya. Istovremeno, policijski načelnik Dale Landry (Dennis Haskins) istražuje dojave očevidaca o opasnom morskom psu koji sije smrt i strah po istoj rijeci, kao i pojavu opasnih kriminalaca predvođenih nemilosrdnim Iceom (Coolio) koji traži davno skriveni novac. Različiti planovi svih tih skupina cijelo će se vrijeme ispreplitati, do krvave završnice. "Crvena rijeka" iznimno je uzbudljiv triler redatelja Charlesa Roberta Carnera, koji je u žanrovsku matricu spretno uklopio i tragove drugih filmskih vrsta, kao što su horor o zastrašujućem prirodnom neprijatelju i avanturistički film potrage, ali i obiteljska drama, koja se očituje u odnosu kapetana Sandersa i njegove bivše supruge. Uz odličnog Loua Diamonda Phillipsa ("La Bamba") u glavnoj ulozi, ekipu upotpunjuje cijeli niz poznatih filmskih i televizijskih lica, ali najdojmljiviji nastup je ostvario glazbenik, slavni reper Coolio(n)</desc>

    <title lang="hr">Crvena rijeka</title>
    <title lang="xx">Red Water</title>
    <desc lang="hr">Da nesreća nikad ne dolazi sama, kao i da se strah javlja tamo gdje ga najmanje očekujemo, pokazuje nam ovaj zanimljivi televizijski triler o ljudima koji su spremni na sve kako bi si osigurali bolju budućnost. Budu li je uopće doživjeli. Suočen s bankrotom, kapetan ribarskog broda iz Louisiane John Sanders (Lou Diamond Phillips) se uz pomoć vjernog pomoćnika Emeryja Broussarda (Rob Boltin) odlučuje na povratak na njihov prvotni posao, potragu i crpljenje podvodnog ulja. Sandersova bivša supruga Kelli (Kristy Swanson) ponudi im velik novac za pomoć pri traženju ogromnog nalazišta pod rijekom Atchafalaya. Istovremeno, policijski načelnik Dale Landry (Dennis Haskins) istražuje dojave očevidaca o opasnom morskom psu koji sije smrt i strah po istoj rijeci, kao i pojavu opasnih kriminalaca predvođenih nemilosrdnim Iceom (Coolio) koji traži davno skriveni novac. Različiti planovi svih tih skupina cijelo će se vrijeme ispreplitati, do krvave završnice. "Crvena rijeka" iznimno je uzbudljiv triler redatelja Charlesa Roberta Carnera, koji je u žanrovsku matricu spretno uklopio i tragove drugih filmskih vrsta, kao što su horor o zastrašujućem prirodnom neprijatelju i avanturistički film potrage, ali i obiteljska drama, koja se očituje u odnosu kapetana Sandersa i njegove bivše supruge. Uz odličnog Loua Diamonda Phillipsa ("La Bamba") u glavnoj ulozi, ekipu upotpunjuje cijeli niz poznatih filmskih i televizijskih lica, ali najdojmljiviji nastup je ostvario glazbenik, slavni reper Coolio(n)</desc>

Catherine visits Nuala and Packie to learn the secrets of making these dishes, before heading to Canada to recreate them for Mark.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The concluding edition of this two-part docu-drama looks at how Shipman covered his tracks and examines the unravelling of decades of lies that subsequently led to his conviction. In March 1998, staff at the local crematorium became suspicious of the deaths signed off by Shipman and alerted the coroner, but a police investigation was stopped after just three weeks. It was the subsequent death of Kathleen Grundy that triggered his downfall, and her daughter and son-in-law Angela and Phil Woodruff describe their reactions when they discovered that Shipman was bizarrely the sole benefactor of Kathleen's estate.(n)</desc>

When the body was identified, her husband Gordon was arrested on suspicion of murder, but the case was dropped on the basis of insufficient evidence in January 1998 and it was another eight years until he was tried and found guilty of Carol's murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.(n)</desc>

The Rhinos completed the historic treble of Challenge Cup, League Leaders' Shield and Super League title last season, but began this campaign without three of their most experienced players. Jamie Peacock and Kylie Leuluai have both now retired, while captain Kevin Sinfield has jumped codes to join Yorkshire Carnegie in rugby union. Brian McDermott's side also made a less-than-ideal start to the defence of their Super League crown, losing their opening game against Warrington Wolves 12-10 on this ground.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Straight Story</title>
    <desc lang="en">David Lynch's Oscar-nominated FilmFour-funded film, based on a true story, stars the late Richard Farnsworth as Alvin Straight. Alvin learns his brother is dying and wants to see him one more time. But he can't afford the air fare and he doesn't have a car. What he has is a tractor-mower that he decides to drive the 300 miles to Wisconsin. The film simply documents his painfully slow progress, the people he meets and the adventures he has but does so with loving care, slowly bringing out Alvin's character but showing along the way how he too brings out the best in those he meets. Unique, superlative filmmaking, stunningly shot by Freddie Francis(n)</desc>

Alvin learns his brother is dying and wants to see him one more time. But he can't afford the air fare and he doesn't have a car. What he has is a tractor-mower that he decides to drive the 300 miles to Wisconsin. The film simply documents his painfully slow progress, the people he meets and the adventures he has but does so with loving care, slowly bringing out Alvin's character but showing along the way how he too brings out the best in those he meets. Unique, superlative filmmaking, stunningly shot by Freddie Francis(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A young couple (Alexie Gilmore, Bryce Johnson) venture into Six Rivers National Forest in Northern California to search for Bigfoot, and make a terrifying discovery in this found-footage horror film from writer-director Bobcat Goldthwait. Convinced that he will capture video evidence of Sasquatch at the same place where the legendary Patterson-Gimlin film was shot, Jim (Bryce Johnson) persuades his skeptical girlfriend Kelly (Alexie Gilmore) to join him on a cryptozoological excursion into the deep woods. Before Jim and Kelly set out on their mission, however, they first visit Willow Creek -- a town that thrives on the Bigfoot phenomenon -- to interview the locals about the legend. There, the couple are repeatedly warned that the forest can be a dangerous place at night -- warnings that go unheeded by Jim as he single-mindedly focuses on making the journey he's dreamt about for years. Later, in the darkened woods, however, the once-carefree couple experience paralyzing fear when someone -- or something -- begins rooting around their campsite, and uttering inhuman howls. Uncertain if they've actually survived an encounter with Bigfoot or simply fallen victim to a cruel prank by the locals, Jim and Kelly agree to pack their bags, and return to civilization at sunrise. But this is just the beginning of a nightmare that neither of them may ever awaken from(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Happy Gilmore</title>
    <desc lang="en">Adam Sandler's second popular starring vehicle after Billy Madison is a goofy lowbrow paean to golf, hockey, and the comic hysterics of its childlike star. In Happy Gilmore, Sandler plays the title character, a raw, determined, but ultimately untalented hockey player who keeps trying out for the pros. When Happy discovers his grandmother (Frances Bay) will lose her home if she doesn't fork over 270,000 dollars to the IRS, he tries to figure out how he can possibly scrounge up the cash. An idea strikes during a game of one-upmanship with a couple furniture movers stripping his grandmother's home: On his first-ever swing, he drives a golf ball farther than the movers have ever seen. Before long, he has transplanted the foul-mouthed, aggressive persona of the hockey rink to the links, winning an amateur tourney that earns him a spot on the pro tour. Throttling everyone from a helpless caddy to game show host Bob Barker during the course of his 90-day quest to amass prize money, Happy also wins the sport a legion of new fans with his in-your-face style. Guiding him on his quest is a whimsical retired pro who lost his hand to an alligator (Carl Weathers) and an attractive public relations woman charmed by Happy's antics (Julie Bowen). Opposing him, however, is sneering hotshot Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald), who will do anything to win his championship jacket and see Happy fail(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Actor, writer, and director Tim Blake Nelson adapts this grim look at the Holocaust from his own play, based on Miklós Nyiszli's book, Auschwitz: A Doctor's Eyewitness Account. The film centers on the Sonderkommando: Jewish concentration camp prisoners whose job was to herd their fellow Jews into the gas chamber, and to dispose of the bodies following the execution. In return, these prisoners received food and a little more time before their own executions. As the members of the sonderkommando struggle to orchestrate what would be the only armed insurrection in Auschwitz, a group of them discover a 14-year-old girl who somehow survived the gas chamber. The girl becomes a symbol for their own spiritual salvation and they become obsessed with keeping the girl alive, even if it endangers the uprising that could save thousands. This film was screened at the 2001 Toronto Film Festival(n)</desc>

The film chronicles a fateful mission ordered by a pharmaceutical giant: to travel deep in to the jungles of Borneo, where a rare black orchid -- one that can be used to attain immortality -- has bloomed for hundreds of years, unbeknownst to man. The eager horticulturists sent have no idea that an indigenous population of bloodthirsty anacondas has been privy to the orchid's properties for years. Not only have the orchids augmented their already phenomenal size, strength, and vitality, they've substantially increased the snakes' appetites for flesh. Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid features Peter Curtis, Johnny Messner, Morris Chestnut, and Eugene Byrd(n)</desc>

Jazmin Biltmore (Mo'Nique) is a plus-size woman trying to find a place in the skin-and-bones world of high fashion. Jazmin has her heart set on launching her own line of clothes for large ladies, but she hasn't had much luck convincing the moneymen that there's a market for her work. Jazmin is also looking for love, but she finds that few men are willing to look past her dress size and see the woman within. Jazmin is becoming despondent when she gets some good news -- she's won an all-expenses paid trip for two to an exclusive resort in Palm Springs, and she and her best friend, Stacey (Kendra C. Johnson), another zaftig woman, head out to enjoy some fun and sun. While on vacation, Jazmin meets Tunde (Jimmy Jean-Louis), a handsome and successful doctor from Nigeria, and she discovers to her surprise that Tunde is strongly attracted to her. Tunde tells Jazmin than in his country, large women are considered beautiful, and his friend Akibo (Godfrey) is similarly drawn to Stacey. Will Jazmin's new luck in love follow into other parts of her life or is Tunde's interest in her just a passing fancy?

He was the only black TV star in Hollywood at a time when America groaned under the weight of racial segregation and prejudice, yet he possessed a natural talent so great that these issues were seemingly swept to one side to allow him to become one of the greatest jazz icons of all time. However, behind closed doors those around him were trying to think of a way to package him as something he was not: bi-white. This candid account of what really happened in and around his 'fairytale' life is taken from his private journals, interviews with his widow Maria and contributions from other family members, Tony Bennett, Buddy Greco, Harry Belafonte, Nancy Wilson, Sir Bruce Forsyth, George Benson, Aaron Neville, Johnny Mathis and many more. Featuring archive never seen before, it reveals Cole's feelings behind his ultimate calling as a 'beacon of hope' to the legions of the oppressed(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Trumpet of the Swan</title>
    <desc lang="en">E.B. White's children's story of a swan searching for his voice comes to life in this animated adventure. When young Louie the Swan is hatched, it's soon discovered that he isn't able to make a sound, which is a matter of no small annoyance to his boastful father (voice of Jason Alexander) and doting mother (voice of Mary Steenburgen). As Louie gets a bit older, he falls in love with Serena (voice of Reese Witherspoon), but he has no way of telling her how he feels. Despondent, Louie flies away, and makes friends with a young boy named Sam (voice of Sam Gifaldi). Sam realizes Louie has a problem, and with the help of his schoolteacher, Mrs. Hammerbotham (Carol Burnett), Louie learns to read and write. Louie is thrilled that he has finally found a way to communicate, but his joy is short-lived when he discovers his fellow swans are not well acquainted with the English language. At long last, Louie finds a way to speak in a way his family and fellows can understand when his father gives him a trumpet; while Louie is thrilled and shows a remarkable gift for the instrument, his dad's happiness is diluted by the fact that the horn is stolen merchandise. Determined to pay for the stolen trumpet and make his family proud, Louie flies away to the big city, where he lands a lucrative gig playing with a jazz combo. At last, Louie has found fame, fortune, and self-respect, but can he win the heart of Serena away from her fiancé, Boyd (Seth Green)? The score for The Trumpet of the Swan was written by noted jazz artist Marcus Miller; rock &amp; roll pioneer Little Richard also contributed a song to the soundtrack(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up?. Originally titled "Nobody Here but Us Martians," this darkly comic Twilight Zone episode was a rewrite of (and vast improvement upon) an unfilmed Rod Serling script from 1958, "The Night of the Big Rain." Having spotted what they think is a UFO, two highway patrolmen converge upon a roadside diner, where an interesting cross-section of humanity has gathered. The patrolmen plant the suggestion that one of the patrons is actually a "spy" from another planet, a suggestion scoffed at by such likely suspects as taciturn Mr. Ross (John Hoyt) and scraggly vagabond Avery (Jack Elam). The check-checkmate ending is one of the series' most memorable, thanks to the skillful underplaying of Barney Phillips as the diner's sarcastic counterman. "Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up?" first aired May 26, 1961(n)</desc>

As the day progresses, it turns out that no one recognizes David, nor is their any record of his ever having existed -- and as a result of his "ravings," he is placed in a mental institution. Is David really crazy, or is his loss of identity merely a bad dream? Well. . .best to stick around until the very, very last scene. Written by Charles Beaumont, "Person or Persons Unknown" made its Twilight Zone bow on March 23, 1962(n)</desc>

Martin Balsam stars as Martin Senescu, curator of a "chamber of horrors" wax museum. Upon learning that the museum is to be demolished, Martin takes his favorite wax statues -- those of Jack the Ripper, Henri "Bluebeard" Landru, and ax murderer Albert W. Hicks -- to his home, much to the dismay of his wife Emma (Maggie Mahoney). Not long afterward, two brutal murders take place -- and the evidence leads Martin to conclude that the culprits were his beloved wax figures. Though credited to Charles Beaumont, "The New Exhibit" was actually scripted by longtime Beaumont collaborator Jerry Sohl(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Invaders. Written by Richard Matheson, this is one of those classic Twilight Zone episodes that has remained in the collective memory long after other lesser episodes (and lesser anthologies) have been forgotten. The action takes place at a remote farmhouse, where a soil-stained farm woman (Agnes Moorehead) is forced to defend herself from a tiny spaceship and its equally diminutive occupants. Except for the final scene, the episode is entirely bereft of dialogue, affording Moorehead the opportunity to deliver a bravura pantomime performance. Originally telecast January 27, 1961, "The Invaders" was selected as the final Twilight Zone rerun of the 1961-62 season -- which at the time was assumed to be the series' very last installment(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Eye of the Beholder</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Eye of the Beholder. An irreducable masterpiece, the Rod Serling-scripted Twilight Zone episode "The Eye of the Beholder" takes place in a hospital in the dead of night. The protagonist is Janet Tyler, who, having been shunned by society because of her hideous ugliness, has just undergone extensive plastic surgery. Knowing full well that she will be shipped off to a community of fellow "outcasts" if the surgery is unsuccessful, Janet tensely awaits the results as the bandages are slowly removed from her face. Even after repeated viewings, this landmark episode loses none of his power and poignancy, with Douglas Heyes' surehanded direction matched by Bernard Herrmann's brilliant musical score. First telecast November 11, 1960, "The Eye of the Beholder" was rerun in the summer of 1962 -- when, to avoid tipping off the punch line, the episode reverted to its working title, "A Private World of Darkness."(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Time Enough at Last. In his first Twilight Zone appearance, Burgess Meredith stars as Henry Bemis, a miopic bank clerk who wants nothing more out of life than to be left alone to read his precious books. He unexpectedly gets his wish when, while hiding in a bank vault with a book in his hands, a hydrogen bomb devastates the city around him. The sole survivor of this nuclear attack, Henry is at first stricken with panic, then becomes delighted at the prospect of reading to his heart's content, without being nagged by his wife (Jacqueline De Wit) or his boss (Vaughn Taylor). The episode's ironic payoff is so well known that it does not bear repeating here; suffice to say that the ending was invoked in the first few moments of 1983's Twilight Zone: The Movie. First telecast November 20, 1959, "Time Enough at Last" was scripted by Rod Serling from a short story by Lynn Venable(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">It's a Good Life</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">It's a Good Life. Adapted by Rod Serling from a story by Jerome Bixby, "It's a Good Life" stands the test of time as one of the best-ever Twilight Zone episodes -- not to mention one of the series' most frightening efforts. The terrified citizens of Peaksville, Ohio, are held in thrall by a "monster" in the form of angelic-looking youngster Anthony Fremont (Billy Mumy). Possessed with the ability to read minds, coupled with mysterious destructive powers, Anthony bristles whenever he senses that someone is thinking bad thoughts -- and whenever he bristles, something really bad happens (yes, this is the one with the cornfield and the jack-in-the-box). Understandably, this episode has always been a favorite of youngsters, who would give anything to wield Anthony Fremont's awesome powers over their own parents. First telecast November 3, 1961, "It's a Good Life" was later reworked in the 1983 theatrical film Twilight Zone: The Movie -- and a few years after that, it was delightfully lampooned on one of The Simpsons' "Treehouse of Horror" episodes(n)</desc>

Cliff Robertson stars as Jerry Etherson, a nightclub ventriloquist with a predilection for liquor and emotional problems. Weighing heavily upon Jerry is the fact that he feels threatened by his dummy Willy -- as well he should, since Willy seems to be doing all his talking on his own. Hoping to rid himself of his little nemesis, Jerry adopts a new wooden companion, Goofy Goggles, but Willy isn't about to be dismissed so easily. The supporting cast features future Gomer Pyle USMC regular Frank Sutton and perennial starlet Edy Williams.
