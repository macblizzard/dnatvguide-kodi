    <title lang="en">Hollywood Ending</title>
    <desc lang="en">A down-on-his luck auteur gets one more chance at the big time -- provided his neuroses don't swallow him whole -- in Woody Allen's 33rd feature release, Hollywood Ending. Allen plays Val Waxman, a one-time cinematic genius who's resorted to taking advertisement work to pay the bills for himself and his airhead live-in girlfriend, Lori (Debra Messing). Val finds his luck is about to change, however, when he receives the script for The City Never Sleeps , a period noir set against the backdrop of 1940s New York City. It seems his ex-wife, Ellie (Tea Leoni), now an executive at Galaxy Pictures, has been pulling for him to direct the picture, claiming he's the only man who can do justice to the script. She even manages to convince her boyfriend, Hal (Treat Williams), Galaxy's high-powered studio head, to take a chance on Val's "unique vision." Just when the cameras are ready to roll, however, Val finds that unique vision in jeopardy -- literally -- as he's struck with a psychosomatic case of blindness. When physicians and psychiatrists fail to cure him, Val contrives a scheme to forge ahead with the picture, for fear of blowing his one last chance at greatness. Hollywood Ending co-stars George Hamilton and Mark Rydell(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Who Wants to Be a Millionaire</title>
    <desc lang="en">Although the once-hot game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? had lost its luster as a prime-time ABC offering, the producers felt that there was enough life left in the property to warrant a Monday-through-Friday syndicated version. Taking over from the earlier series' host Regis Philbin was Meredith Vieira of The View. To make certain that the series would not be bankrupted after its first week on the air, the questions posed to contestants were considerably harder than those on the prime-time incarnation. Also, the famous "fastest finger" round was eliminated, taking some of the pressure off the contestants when they struggled to come up with answers. The most noteworthy change from the original version was the absence of Regis Philbin's familiar catchphrases: One would never hear Meredith Vieira chime in with the legendary "Is that your final answer?" The syndicated Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? was launched on September 16, 2002(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Although the once-hot game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? had lost its luster as a prime-time ABC offering, the producers felt that there was enough life left in the property to warrant a Monday-through-Friday syndicated version. Taking over from the earlier series' host Regis Philbin was Meredith Vieira of The View. To make certain that the series would not be bankrupted after its first week on the air, the questions posed to contestants were considerably harder than those on the prime-time incarnation. Also, the famous "fastest finger" round was eliminated, taking some of the pressure off the contestants when they struggled to come up with answers. The most noteworthy change from the original version was the absence of Regis Philbin's familiar catchphrases: One would never hear Meredith Vieira chime in with the legendary "Is that your final answer?" The syndicated Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? was launched on September 16, 2002(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Planet of the Apes</title>
    <desc lang="en">Tim Burton called his interpretation of the classic film a 're-imagining' and it incorporates both stunning visual effects and very human (and simian) emotions. Mark Wahlberg plays astronaut Leo Davidson, whipped through space and time to a 'world' where apes and gorillas rule the humans. Captured, he is nurtured by Ari (Helena Bonham Carter) and hunted by General Thade (Tim Roth) as he leads a rebel group of humans and chimpanzees in search of his downed craft. This is his only hope of escape and, ironically, the planet's only hope of shaking off the tyranny of the gorillas, allowing peaceful humans and chimpanzees to co-exist. Homages include a cameo from Charlton Heston, with a re-phrasing of his most famous line from the original, and an ending just as stunning but much more frightening in its implication(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A Nebraska bank clerk finds his tenuous grip on reality slipping after a freak train accident reveals his deepest secret to the entire community. John Skillpa (Cillian Murphy) is a reserved bank teller living in the tight-knit community of Peacock. He may live by himself, but he's never alone; John has two personalities. His alter ego is Emma, but Emma has always been a well-kept secret -- until now. When a passing caboose jumps the rails and comes slamming through John's backyard, the neighbors all race to his aid and are surprised to find Emma wandering about dazed and confused. Instinctively assuming Emma to be John's wife, they rally around the Skillpas in support. But the harder they try to get closer to Emma, the deeper John slips into psychosis. The key to his mystery-shrouded past resting in the hands of young, overburdened mother Maggie (Ellen Page), John finds his two personalities clashing as his fragile deception becomes ever more difficult to maintain. Susan Sarandon, Keith Carradine, Bill Pullman, and Josh Lucas co-star(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Fracture</title>
    <desc lang="en">A structural engineer (Anthony Hopkins) and an ambitious young district attorney (Ryan Gosling) become locked in a deadly battle of wits when the former is found innocent in the attempted murder of his wife in director Gregory Hoblit's tense tale of courtroom mind games. Ted Crawford (Hopkins) is an engineer who lives with his wife, Jennifer (Embeth Davidtz), in the couple's lavish Southern California home. One day, after carefully planning out the details to ensure that there is no way he can be convicted of murder, Ted shoots his wife in a blatant attempt to kill the woman. When head hostage negotiator Rob Nunally (Billy Burke) arrives on the scene to speak with Ted, he is shocked to find that the victim of the shooting is in fact his longtime lover. Though Jennifer survives the trauma of being shot in the head at close range, she hovers comatose between life and death as star prosecutor Willy Beachum (Gosling) reluctantly accepts the case while preparing to leave the Los Angeles criminal court system behind for a more promising career at a posh private law firm. Though the DA (David Strathairn) vehemently resents Beachum's lofty plan for departure, the hotshot young lawyer remains convinced that he can expedite the apparently open-and-shut case and be on his way to greener pastures in one week's time at the very most. Beachum's swelling ego betrays him, however, as his future boss Nikki Gardner (Rosamund Pike) begins to turn up the heat and fracture mechanics specialist Ted chooses to represent himself at the trial knowing well that a career spent spotting structural flaws in aeronautical systems has instilled him with just the kind of argumentative skills needed to riddle the swaggering young lawyer's "foolproof" case with doubt(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Brett Ratner's martial-arts action-comedy sequel starring Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan. When the Chinese Ambassador to the US is shot while divulging the whereabouts of a major Triad leader, the American authorities once again send Chief Inspector Lee and Detective James Carter into the fray. Lee quickly corners the would-be assassin, Kenji, but his shock at coming face-to-face with an old friend gives the baddie just enough time to escape. Kenji's trail leads the mismatched cops to Paris, where car chases and a sequence among the under-dressed dancers of the Folies Bergère await them, plus rather a lot of dodgy French stereotypes and a finale atop the Eiffel Tower. Also starring Youki Kudoh and Noémie Lenoir, together with, in unlikely cameos, Max von Sydow and Roman Polanski(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">James Herriot Compilation.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Ellie Harrison visits Thirsk in North Yorkshire to celebrate the centenary of James Herriot, arguably the world's most famous vet. Known as Alf Wight to his family and friends, his semi-autobiographical accounts of his work - which began with the publication of All Creatures Great and Small in 1972 - won him an international fanbase, and inspired many youngsters in the 1970s and 1980s to become vets themselves. Here, Ellie meets Wight's son and daughter, and the vets that run his practice today. She also meets Christopher Timothy, the actor who played the part of Herriot in the BBC's adaptation of All Creatures Great and Small, and revisits classic moments from the Countryfile archive that highlight the work of people who have dedicated their time to helping animals. Including Weather for the Week Ahead.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Historian Bettany Hughes explores the period from 1000BC to 43AD, comprising the Bronze and Iron Ages, which saw Britain engulfed by widespread flooding and the hunter-gatherers forced to abandon their homes and learn new skills. Tribes came into existence and people gave themselves names, picked rulers, used simple coinage and became traders with their continental neighbours.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Bettany Hughes considers the fourth age, between 410 and 1066AD, a period of change that led to the disintegration of Britannia following the gradual collapse of the Roman Empire and an invasion by Scandinavians and northern Europeans, hungry for power and land. Out of the upheaval and chaos came the gradual development of a wealthy, independent England, which many would recognise today in areas of language, law, religion and economy.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Winter.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">David Attenborough examines how the arrival of winter sparks a ruthless battle for survival in the polar regions, with temperatures plummeting to -70C, winds reaching 120mph and day-long darkness. As a blizzard rages, a polar bear treks into the Arctic mountains to give birth, while the entire world population of spectacled eider braves the weather in a giant ice hole. Wolves and bison engage in battle, but alliances are also made, and beneath the snow, voles try to dodge the attacks of great grey owls and weasels.(n)</desc>

He also discovers how the Danish armed forces maintain their country's claim to Greenland's natural resources by mounting a 2,000-mile dog sled patrol during the winter, and finds out how a research base at the South Pole is able to cope with being cut off from the outside world for six months at a time.(n)</desc>

He begins by travelling to the North Pole, where two polar bears reveal a surprisingly tender side to their characters, before heading to the South Pole - 100 years after Roald Amundsen and Robert Falcon Scott first reached it.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Documentary in which three people who were the lone survivors of aircraft crashes discuss their ordeals, detailing the conflicting emotions they experienced after realising everyone else on board had died. D-Day veteran Phil Bradley was trapped in his seat for 36 hours after the plane he was travelling on crashed in Virginia in 1959, while Annette Herfkens drank rainwater to stay alive after a Vietnam Airlines jet crashed into a mountain in 1992. Juliane Koepcke, meanwhile, tells of being lost for 10 days in the Peruvian rainforest after a plane crash in 1971, and how her knowledge of jungle terrain helped to save her life.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Ants.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Chris Packham explores the ingenious ways in which ants have collaborated to colonise the planet like no other animal. Natural air conditioning systems keep them cool in their nests, shelters made from their own bodies protect them from the elements, and a strong sense of smell helps them to overpower animals hundreds of times larger than themselves. Plus, a look at recent research that reveals how ant colonies are capable of immunising themselves against certain diseases.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Elephants.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Chris Packham explores the anatomy and physiology of the largest land animal on the planet, the elephant. Its size seems ill-suited to surviving the most arid regions of Africa, but its inner workings allow it to defy the extreme heat of the desert, and find food and water in seemingly barren landscapes, while its extraordinary memory enables it to repel predators. Here, Chris reveals how hairs on the skin help to keep the elephant cool, and how sensors in its feet may be able to guide it toward rain.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">School Ties</title>
    <desc lang="en">An assemblage of young Hollywood actors poised for stardom marked this tale of anti-Semitism at a 1950s prep school. Brendan Fraser stars as David Greene, a working-class Jewish quarterback from Scranton, Pennsylvania, who is offered a senior year scholarship to a prestigious New England academy. It's David's ticket to an Ivy League education and a way out of his Rust Belt hometown, but there's one condition: the school's elders ask him to be discreet about his religion. At first willing to do so, David struggles with his silence about his faith as his popularity grows. David strikes up a friendship with his roommate Chris Reece (Chris O'Donnell) and a possible romance with Sally Wheeler (Amy Locane), a student at a nearby girls' school. When jealous classmate Charlie Dillon (Matt Damon) learns David's secret at an alumni party, he exposes the school's new gridiron hero, and David faces the full force of religious intolerance from the prejudiced WASP institution. Also featuring early performances from Ben Affleck, Anthony Rapp, and Cole Hauser, School Ties was loosely based on the real-life experiences of producer Dick Wolf, creator of TV's popular series Law &amp; Order(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Gabrielle Union, Morris Chestnut, Queen Latifah, and Terrence Howard star in a film concerning a young girl who implores a department-store Santa to find a new husband for her divorced mother for Christmas. Single mother of three Nancy (Union) has been putting the needs of her three children ahead of her own for as far back as she can remember, and lately her youngest daughter, Emily (Khail Bryant), has become acutely aware of her mother's palpable sadness. As Christmas draws near, Nancy takes her kids to the mall for a cheerful visit with jolly old Saint Nick. When it comes time for Emily's turn to sit on Santa's lap and make her Christmas wish, she selflessly remembers her mother's recent comment that a compliment from a man would be the best gift of all. Determined to make her mother happy again even if it means sacrificing her own wish, Emily relays the message to Santa (Chestnut), not realizing that the man beneath the beard is actually an office-supply salesman and ambitious singer/songwriter named Benjamin. Recognizing the daughter's love for her mother and sensing something truly special in Nancy, Benjamin cheerfully obliges the young girl, setting into motion a series of events that promise to make this the most memorable holiday in quite some time.

    <title lang="en">The Prophecy 3: The Ascent</title>
    <desc lang="en">In the third installment of the series that began with The Prophecy, the Angel Gabriel (Christopher Walken) has taken up residence on Earth, where he's learned to enjoy the simple pleasures of life among humans, such as frosted doughnuts and driving a convertible. One night, he witnesses Danyael (Dave Buzzotta), a heretic preacher with a storefront church who tells his flock that God doesn't care much for the people who tend the Earth. A blind man (Brad Dourif) who claims to hear the voice of God shoots Danyael several times in the chest. However, several hours after he's pronounced dead, Danyael rises from his slab at the morgue and heads out into the street. Maggie (Kayren Ann Butler), his understandably upset girlfriend, is then approached by Zouhael (Vincent Spano), a fallen angel who needs Danyael for his own evil purposes. It seems that Danyael is half human and half angel, and both Gabriel and Zouhael want his help. A Spirit of genocide and destruction is about to rise on a Native American reservation, and if Gabriel is going to stop it -- or Zouhael is going to bring it forward -- they will need Danyael's guidance. Prophecy 3: The Ascent marked the directorial debut of Patrick Lussier, who has often worked as an editor for horror director Wes Craven(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Homer's Odyssey. Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) has never been one of the more distinguished employees at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, but he reaches the last straw after a long series of accidents when he crashes an electric cart into a pipe full of radioactive waste -- just as his son Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright) is touring the plant with his class from school. Homer has no luck finding a new job, and falls into a deep depression; eventually, Homer decides to drown himself by jumping off a bridge, but when his family arrives at the last moment to save him, they're nearly hit by a speeding car. Deciding the intersection near the bridge is dangerous, Homer appears at a Springfield City Council meeting to demand a stop sign be installed; when the council agrees, Homer decides he's found a new purpose in life, and he becomes Springfield's leading safety crusader. Before long, Homer has become affiliated with People Against People for Nuclear Energy, a group looking to close down the Nuclear Power Plant for a number of safety violations. But Homer still needs a job, and he finds himself torn when the plant's owner Mr. Burns (voice of Harry Shearer) offers him a cushy, higher-paying job to shut him up. "Homer's Odyssey" was first aired on January 21, 1990(n)</desc>

After a free copy of the magazine Reading Digest arrives in the mail, Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) becomes a sudden (if short-lived) convert to the joys of the written word, and when he discovers the magazine is sponsoring a children's essay competition for "Patriots of Tomorrow," he urges Lisa (voice of Yeardley Smith) to enter. Lisa's essay is good enough to land her in the competition finals, and the Simpson family is flown to Washington D.C., all expenses paid, for the occasion. While Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright) teaches Homer some lessons about the value of room service, Lisa spots one of Springfield's congressmen taking a bribe from a lobbyist to bypass environmental legislation. Angry and disillusioned, Lisa tosses away her essay about the value of democracy and instead reads a new one about the spread of political corruption in the United States, little realizing the lengths to which the federal government will go to ensure that one little girl can believe in the integrity of America's leadership. "Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington" was first aired on September 26, 1991(n)</desc>

Vostrikov's mission is to quickly ready the ill-prepared sub for her maiden voyage - no matter what the cost. But Vostrikov, Polenin and K-19's loyal crew can never imagine all that is expected of them. Neither can they fathom what the price of failure might be for them and for the world when a nuclear reactor malfunctions, threatening a core meltdown and an explosion that will certainly kill all aboard. As they glide beneath the Arctic seas, it is the crew's collective bravery and Vostrikov's daring embrace of his duty toward his country and his men which will ultimately save K-19... and stave off what surely would have been a nuclear disaster(n)</desc>

But Vostrikov, Polenin and K-19's loyal crew can never imagine all that is expected of them. Neither can they fathom what the price of failure might be for them and for the world when a nuclear reactor malfunctions, threatening a core meltdown and an explosion that will certainly kill all aboard. As they glide beneath the Arctic seas, it is the crew's collective bravery and Vostrikov's daring embrace of his duty toward his country and his men which will ultimately save K-19... and stave off what surely would have been a nuclear disaster(n)</desc>

After getting trapped in the elevator on their way out, however, events take a horrifically grim turn as the doors open to reveal that the once sterile and bustling surroundings are now ominously silent and dank. With mutilated bodies strewn about and murderous gang of monsters stalking them through an endless maze of corroded hallways, the only remaining hope for the frightened father and daughter now lies in the affected mind of a little girl who may understand more about the situation than anyone realizes(n)</desc>

Featuring full-blooded, multi-faceted characters whose conflicting motivations and ethics are both utterly credible and deeply intriguing, this is a dark, gritty tale of power, treachery and greed that belies its fantasy trappings(n)</desc>

The setting is Los Angeles, CA, and the event is the wedding between a man and a woman who always seemed destined to be together. Unfortunately, all relationships can't be as healthy as Elise and Michael's is, and though best man and maid of honor Rich (Aaron Stanford) and Samantha (Melissa Sagemiller) seem to be preparing to take the plunge, the same certainly cannot be said for neurotic actress Lana (Mena Suvari). A free-spirited soul who has experienced flings with a variety of wedding attendees including the hapless Pockets (Jon Abrahams), alcoholic actor Simon (James Van Der Beek), and manic children's television program host Donovan (Ethan Embry), Lana attempts to sort out her past flings as lovelorn agent Quentin (Colin Hanks) pines for the bride's sister and the estranged father of the groom attempts to reconnect with his long-lost son(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">After pledging her late mother's once-dignified sorority, a college freshman aligns herself with seven social outcasts in an attempt to influence change over the school's flawed social hierarchy in this comedy starring Amanda Bynes. College freshman Sydney White (Bynes) has just arrived at Southern Atlantic University ready and eager to pledge her late mother's sorority. Once upon a time, this sorority was dignified and respected, but that pristine reputation has been tarnished now that blonde tyrant Rachel (Sara Paxton) has taken over as student council president. After surviving the sorority's vigorous pledging process, Syd is quickly banished for daring to question Rachel's regime. Now left with nowhere to go but a condemned house on the edge of Greek Row, the dejected and rejected pledge quickly makes friends with seven of the biggest social outcasts on campus. But while these socially challenged frat boys may not be much to look at, it gradually becomes apparent to Syd that they all have their fair share of admirable qualities -- especially love-struck super-geek Tyler (Matt Long). Perhaps if these nerdy frat boys and their new queen could successfully shake up the system by staging a successful takeover of the student government, they could restore the once-proud reputation of this prestigious university and offer a glimmer of hope to campus geeks everywhere!(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Jackie Brown is the name of a flight attendant who gets caught smuggling her boss' gun money on the airline she works for. Luckily for her, the Fed Ray Nicolet and the LA Cop Mark Dargus decide to team up in order to arrest the arms dealer she works for, whose name they don't even know. Here's when she has to choose one way: tell Nicolet and Dargus about Ordell Robbie (the arms dealer) and get her freedom - except that if Ordell suspects you're talking about him, you're dead - or keep her mouth shut and do some time. That's when she meets Max Cherry - her bail bondsman -, a late-fifties, recently separated, burnt-out man, who falls in love with her. Then Jackie comes up with a plan to play the Feds off against Ordell and the guys he works with - Louis Gara and Melanie Ralston, among others - and walk off with their money. But she needs Max's help. No-one is going to stand in the way of his million-dollar payoff... Starring Pam Grier, Samuel L. Jackson and Bridget Fonda(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">An American Haunting</title>
    <desc lang="en">The wind whispers ominous warnings of death before a malevolent entity arrives to claim the life of a young girl as director Courtney Solomon brings author Brent Monahan's chilling, fact-based story of supernatural murder to the screen in this tale of terror starring Donald Sutherland and Sissy Spacek. The year is 1818 and the Bell family is a quiet clan residing on a remote farm in Red River, TN. A normal, loving family by all accounts, the uneventful lives of the Bell family begin to take a dark turn when strange noises around the farm are followed by the arrival of a black wolf with piercing yellow eyes said to strike unspeakable fear into the very soul of all who encounter it. As the sadistic spirit singles out the youngest daughter of the Bell family for torment and her frightened parents search frantically for a rational explanation to the chilling events unfolding in their once-happy home, an eerie, disembodied voice promises death from beyond the grave. With the struggle rapidly turning violent and the Bells' desperate prayers for mercy going unanswered time and again, the shocking murder that followed would prove the only case in recorded American history where the death of a human being was directly attributed to an attack by an evil entity or spirit(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Drumline</title>
    <desc lang="en">After decades of movies about college sports, the bands who take the field at halftime finally get their day in the sun in this musical comedy drama. Devon Miles (Nick Cannon) is a talented young percussionist from Harlem who wins a music scholarship to Atlanta A &amp; T, a prestigious African-American university. For years, Atlanta A &amp; T has won awards for their show-style marching band, who combine expert musicianship (incorporating funk, R&amp;B, and jazz rhythms into the traditional marching band repertoire) with choreography, dancing cheerleaders, and roof-raising showmanship. Dr. Aaron Lee (Orlando Jones), the school's band director, gives Devon a spot in the marching band's drumline, the heart and soul of a show-style band, but discovers Devon's previous musical education hardly meets his usual standard when he learns that his new drummer can't read music. Devon soon earns a reputation as a stubborn individualist within the band, not necessarily a good thing in an ensemble where a strictly unified performance is considers the ideal. Devon's cocksure attitude and streetwise style doesn't mesh very comfortably with Sean Taylor (Leonard Roberts), a disciplined senior who resents the presence of the upstart freshman in the drumline, and things become even less harmonious when Devon begins making a play for Laila (Zoe Saldana), a beautiful girl who is also being courted by Sean. Songwriter and record producer Dallas Austin, who has worked with Boyz II Men, TLC, and Pink, served as executive producer for Drumline, helped produce the film's musical score, and contributed his own experiences as a marching band member to the screenplay(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Parker</title>
    <desc lang="en">A principled thief seeks vengeance against the gang of criminals who left him for dead following a major heist as author Donald E. Westlake's pulp anti-hero returns to the screen under the assured direction of Hollywood veteran Taylor Hackford (The Devil's Advocate, Ray). When veteran thief Hurley (Nick Nolte) assembles a crackerjack crew for a big heist at the Ohio State Fair, his fiercely independent protégé Parker (Jason Statham) is the perfect man to take the lead on the job. Together with Melander (Michael Chiklis), Ross (Clifton Collins Jr.), Hardwicke (Micah Hauptman), and Carlson (Wendell Pierce), Parker successfully pulls off a daring daytime heist that nets the crew more than $1 million. But when Parker respectfully declines Melander's offer to invest their take in an ambitious diamond heist with a massive potential payday, he is unceremoniously shot and left for dead. Unfortunately for Melander and his gang, Parker is still very much alive, and he's determined to have his revenge. With the help of Hurley and Hurley's daughter Claire (Emma Booth), Parker manages to learn that the heist will take place in West Palm Beach, FL, and he travels there to pose as a wealthy Texan seeking to purchase a new home. Meanwhile, astute real-estate agent Leslie Rodgers (Jennifer Lopez) quickly sees through Parker's game and asks to get a cut of the action. Now a team, Parker and Leslie figure out that the gang is planning to hit a high-profile jewelry auction. All they have to do is wait until Melander and his men have pulled off the heist. Once the jewels are secure and the thieves are lying low at a local house, the stage will be set for Parker to take his revenge and make a small fortune in the process(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Parker</title>
    <desc lang="en">A principled thief seeks vengeance against the gang of criminals who left him for dead following a major heist as author Donald E. Westlake's pulp anti-hero returns to the screen under the assured direction of Hollywood veteran Taylor Hackford (The Devil's Advocate, Ray). When veteran thief Hurley (Nick Nolte) assembles a crackerjack crew for a big heist at the Ohio State Fair, his fiercely independent protégé Parker (Jason Statham) is the perfect man to take the lead on the job. Together with Melander (Michael Chiklis), Ross (Clifton Collins Jr.), Hardwicke (Micah Hauptman), and Carlson (Wendell Pierce), Parker successfully pulls off a daring daytime heist that nets the crew more than $1 million. But when Parker respectfully declines Melander's offer to invest their take in an ambitious diamond heist with a massive potential payday, he is unceremoniously shot and left for dead. Unfortunately for Melander and his gang, Parker is still very much alive, and he's determined to have his revenge. With the help of Hurley and Hurley's daughter Claire (Emma Booth), Parker manages to learn that the heist will take place in West Palm Beach, FL, and he travels there to pose as a wealthy Texan seeking to purchase a new home.

Villages on the island of Ceram have known of the so-called Orang Bati for generations. They say it attacks unprovoked; swooping in on its victims in the forest, in villages- virtually nowhere is safe. They say it has a huge wingspan and makes a terrifying sound before it attacks. Could it be a giant bird of prey or some other winged predator? Richard finds witnesses who tell him of its giant, black wings and deafening call. Determined to find out what kind of animal is behind the attacks, Richard begins a journey that takes him from the rain forest canopy, along crocodile-infested rivers and into dark, damp caves. On an island thats so remote its scarcely been researched, Richard has no idea what to expect. But hes convinced theres something terrifying behind these attacks, and hes going to find it(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The broadcaster explores the Galapagos, a collection of volcanic islands in the Pacific known for its extraordinary wildlife. More than 150 years after Charles Darwin formulated his ground-breaking theory of evolution on the remote archipelago, Attenborough explains how life on the islands has continued to evolve in biological isolation, examining how the ever-changing volcanic landscape has given birth to species and sub-species that exist nowhere else in the world. He begins by revealing how Galapagos rose from the ocean four million years ago.(n)</desc>

Since then she has been sleeping on a hospital bed in the kitchen, with no washing or toilet facilities.

    <sub-title lang="en">Origin.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The broadcaster explores the Galapagos, a collection of volcanic islands in the Pacific known for its extraordinary wildlife. More than 150 years after Charles Darwin formulated his ground-breaking theory of evolution on the remote archipelago, Attenborough explains how life on the islands has continued to evolve in biological isolation, examining how the ever-changing volcanic landscape has given birth to species and sub-species that exist nowhere else in the world. He begins by revealing how Galapagos rose from the ocean four million years ago.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Another chance to see the third and final day at Hazeltine National Golf Club in Minnesota, featuring the singles matches between the USA and Europe. The 12 matchplay contests always produce a wealth of drama and quality golf, although Europe eased to a relatively comfortable victory last time out at Gleneagles, turning a 10-6 overnight advantage into a 16.5-11.5 triumph. This time the Americans started as favourites, with half of the European team never having experienced Ryder Cup golf before, adding extra responsibility to the likes of Rory McIlroy, Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Big Eyes</title>
    <desc lang="en">The true story of painter Margaret Keane's life in obscurity while her husband gleaned the notoriety for being the face of her work is brought to the screen by Tim Burton and his Ed Wood screenwriters, Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. The story opens in the late 1950s, when Margaret Keane (Amy Adams) packs up the car with her daughter and their personal belongings, and leaves her husband to start a new life in San Francisco. There, Margaret quickly reconnects with her old friend DeeAnn (Krysten Ritter), and falls head over heels for Walter (Christoph Waltz), an artist and part-time real-estate broker who soon shows great interest in her unique paintings of small children with strikingly expressive, saucer-like eyes. Before long, the two are married, and Walter is claiming credit for Margaret's increasingly popular paintings. With the money rolling in, Margaret initially agrees to go along with the ruse, but the closer she gets to her new husband the more she begins to realize that he's little more than a smooth-talking scam artist. Later, riddled with guild over the fact that she's been deceiving her own daughter as her paintings become a pop-culture phenomenon, Margaret leaves the increasingly abusive Walter, and moves to Hawaii. Only then does Margaret gain the confidence to reclaim the works that have been credited to her husband, even when doing so entails going before the judge and proving that she and she alone created the enchanting children with the big eyes. Danny Huston, Terence Stamp, and Jason Schwartzman co-star(n)</desc>

A likeable young man despite his depressive disposition, Zia (Patrick Fugit) puts blade to wrist only to find that the pain of life doesn't end with the coming of death. Now trapped in a bleak metaphysical landscape populated entirely by suicide victims blearily searching for the joys that eluded them in the physical realm, Zia soon learns that the love is one of the latest arrivals in the dreary land of the dead. As Zia sets out to locate his ill-fated former companion and experience the joys that eluded the couple in life, he is joined in his quest by a lovelorn Russian rocker named Eugene (Shea Wigham) and an accidental tourist named Mikal (Shannyn Sossamon), who's looking for a way out of the sorrowful stir(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Money and emotions lead to a difficult reunion between a father and daughter in this drama. Reese Holden (Zooey Deschanel) is a struggling stage actress in New York City whose life has become an uphill struggle -- her career isn't giving her satisfaction, her relationship with would-be rock star Ray (Dallas Roberts) is stuck in neutral, an affair with her friend Rob (Robert Beitzel) brings no excitement, and her colleague Deirdre (Deirdre O'Connell) simply doesn't understand her problems. Reese is also short on money, which is why she's willing to listen to a proposal from a publisher who wants to release a series of love letters that her mother, a well-known author who died years ago, wrote to her father, Don (Ed Harris), another respected novelist who has fallen out of the limelight but is said to be working on a final major work. Having accepted an advance for the collection, Reese pays a visit to Don in Michigan to get his OK for the project and collect the letters, but discovers two strangers have moved in with Don -- Shelly (Amelia Warner), who studied under Don and has installed herself as his business manager, and Corbit (Will Ferrell), a neighborhood sad sack who helps with the housekeeping and runs errands for the reclusive writer. As Reese vies with Shelly for her father's attention, she struggles to come to terms with issues from her childhood and the dissatisfaction with her life. Winter Passing was written and directed by noted playwright Adam Rapp; it was his first feature film(n)</desc>

Maggie believes Jenna and Eric are not fit parents, but when she takes the matter up with detective John Travis (Jimmy Smits), they discover that a number of children born on the same day as Cody have also been abducted recently. Even worse, it seems that Cody may now be in the hands of Satanists who, in accordance with Biblical prophecy, believe the little girl may be mankind's last line of defense against ultimate evil.

    <title lang="en">Big Eyes</title>
    <desc lang="en">The true story of painter Margaret Keane's life in obscurity while her husband gleaned the notoriety for being the face of her work is brought to the screen by Tim Burton and his Ed Wood screenwriters, Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. The story opens in the late 1950s, when Margaret Keane (Amy Adams) packs up the car with her daughter and their personal belongings, and leaves her husband to start a new life in San Francisco. There, Margaret quickly reconnects with her old friend DeeAnn (Krysten Ritter), and falls head over heels for Walter (Christoph Waltz), an artist and part-time real-estate broker who soon shows great interest in her unique paintings of small children with strikingly expressive, saucer-like eyes. Before long, the two are married, and Walter is claiming credit for Margaret's increasingly popular paintings. With the money rolling in, Margaret initially agrees to go along with the ruse, but the closer she gets to her new husband the more she begins to realize that he's little more than a smooth-talking scam artist. Later, riddled with guild over the fact that she's been deceiving her own daughter as her paintings become a pop-culture phenomenon, Margaret leaves the increasingly abusive Walter, and moves to Hawaii. Only then does Margaret gain the confidence to reclaim the works that have been credited to her husband, even when doing so entails going before the judge and proving that she and she alone created the enchanting children with the big eyes. Danny Huston, Terence Stamp, and Jason Schwartzman co-star(n)</desc>

As Zia sets out to locate his ill-fated former companion and experience the joys that eluded the couple in life, he is joined in his quest by a lovelorn Russian rocker named Eugene (Shea Wigham) and an accidental tourist named Mikal (Shannyn Sossamon), who's looking for a way out of the sorrowful stir(n)</desc>

Reese Holden (Zooey Deschanel) is a struggling stage actress in New York City whose life has become an uphill struggle -- her career isn't giving her satisfaction, her relationship with would-be rock star Ray (Dallas Roberts) is stuck in neutral, an affair with her friend Rob (Robert Beitzel) brings no excitement, and her colleague Deirdre (Deirdre O'Connell) simply doesn't understand her problems. Reese is also short on money, which is why she's willing to listen to a proposal from a publisher who wants to release a series of love letters that her mother, a well-known author who died years ago, wrote to her father, Don (Ed Harris), another respected novelist who has fallen out of the limelight but is said to be working on a final major work. Having accepted an advance for the collection, Reese pays a visit to Don in Michigan to get his OK for the project and collect the letters, but discovers two strangers have moved in with Don -- Shelly (Amelia Warner), who studied under Don and has installed herself as his business manager, and Corbit (Will Ferrell), a neighborhood sad sack who helps with the housekeeping and runs errands for the reclusive writer. As Reese vies with Shelly for her father's attention, she struggles to come to terms with issues from her childhood and the dissatisfaction with her life. Winter Passing was written and directed by noted playwright Adam Rapp; it was his first feature film(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Skinwalkers</title>
    <desc lang="en">His 13th birthday fast drawing near, an unsuspecting young boy on the verge of a remarkable transformation remains completely unaware that an ancient prophecy is set to be fulfilled with the rising of the red moon. To most folks, 12-year-old Timmy (Matthew Knight) would seem an average adolescent with a bright future on the horizon. In the tiny town of Huguenot, however, nothing is as it seems. As Timmy's health rapidly begins to take a turn for the worse, his concerned mother, Rachel (Rhona Mitra), does her best to care for the ailing young boy. Though his mother may not have a clue as to what fate is about to befall her frightened child, a group of specially appointed guardians who have been watching over Timmy since birth know the truth about the events that are beginning to unfold. Timmy is a half-blood, and when the red moon is full, the creature who once appeared to be a normal boy will finally gain the power to take control of his family's destiny. But until that fateful night, Timmy's life will be in constant danger by the renegade faction of lycanthropes who are willing to kill in order to maintain their vicious way of life. It won't be long until the red moon rises, but until that prophesied moment, the forces of light and the forces of darkness will clash in the ultimate battle for true supremacy. Jason X director James Isaac takes the helm for a frightening tale of fate and fantasy co-starring Elias Koteas, Jason Behr, and Kim Coates(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Daydream Nation</title>
    <desc lang="en">A girl looking for kicks gets a whole lot more than she bargained for in a singularly curious town in this dark comedy. Caroline Wexler (Kat Dennings) is a clever but cynical 17-year-old whose father is still adjusting to the death of his wife. Caroline's dad takes a new job and they move to a strange community where the sky is always dark thanks to an industrial fire that's been burning for several months and isn't going to be put out anytime soon. Caroline doesn't have much use for her backward drug-addled classmates, and so to relieve her boredom she sets out to seduce Mr. Anderson (Josh Lucas), the best-looking man on the school's faculty. While Mr. Anderson tries to avoid responding to Caroline's blunt sexual overtures, it isn't long before he succumbs to her charms and is sleeping with his new student.

Caroline Wexler (Kat Dennings) is a clever but cynical 17-year-old whose father is still adjusting to the death of his wife. Caroline's dad takes a new job and they move to a strange community where the sky is always dark thanks to an industrial fire that's been burning for several months and isn't going to be put out anytime soon. Caroline doesn't have much use for her backward drug-addled classmates, and so to relieve her boredom she sets out to seduce Mr. Anderson (Josh Lucas), the best-looking man on the school's faculty. While Mr. Anderson tries to avoid responding to Caroline's blunt sexual overtures, it isn't long before he succumbs to her charms and is sleeping with his new student. But Caroline's new romance turns into a romantic triangle when Thurston (Reece Thompson), one of her stoner classmates, falls head over heels for her and she gives him a chance to impress her.

    <desc lang="en">With the advent of DNA evidence, a number of convicted criminals have been able to finally be exonerated of crimes they'd never committed in the first place. Naturally, this has added a good deal of fuel to the debates surrounding the American judicial system and capital punishment. In this documentary, Academy Award-nominated director Jessica Sanders takes a look at not only the process of freeing the wrongly convicted but the obstacles that face the prisoners once they are finally freed and attempt return to mainstream society. After Innocence premiered at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">John Travolta stars in this thriller as divorced husband and father Frank Morrison, a boat builder concerned about his son Danny (Matthew O'Leary), a troubled 11-year-old who has shown a tendency to lie since his parents broke up. When his ex-wife Susan (Teri Polo) announces that she's getting remarried to Rick Barnes (Vince Vaughn), a recent arrival in town and a popular, wealthy philanthropist, Frank struggles with jealousy but feels that Rick might be a stabilizing influence for his son. When Danny begins relating unsettling stories about Rick, Frank at first chalks it up to youthful rebellion, but when Danny stridently claims to have witnessed his new stepfather committing murder, Frank's instincts tell him the story is true. As he investigates the new man in his family's life, Frank uncovers alarming facts about Rick, who's not the man he appears to be. Domestic Disturbance (2001) made headlines six months before its release when co-star Steve Buscemi, accompanied by Vaughn and screenwriter Scott Rosenberg, was stabbed and seriously injured in an after-hours bar brawl with locals near the film's North Carolina set(n)</desc>

Leeloo (Milla Jovovich) is the 'Fifth Element', a being who represents all that is good in the universe. Every 5,000 years, a doorway between two parallel dimensions opens which allows the forces of darkness to strike back at the forces of good in this dimension. Only by assembling the five elements at the crucial moment can the forces of good overcome those of evil - Korben's new-found mission is to protect Leeloo from the evil Zorg (Gary Oldman) and his army of dog-like mercenaries, the Mangalores(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Butterfly</title>
    <desc lang="en">Veteran director Jose Luis Cuerda delivered this sensitive portrait of a child coming of age during a tense political situation just before the Spanish Civil War. On his first day of school, frail eight-year-old Moncho (Manuel Lozano) is so terrified by the imposing figure of his teacher Don Gregorio (Fernando Fernan Gomez) that he flees into the nearby woods. In spite of his authoritarian appearance, the schoolmaster proves to be a kind, free-thinking Republican who teaches Moncho the virtues of being good. The boy is soon spending much of his time with the elderly Gregorio in the Galician countryside, admiring such wonders of nature as the tongue of a butterfly. Other people in young Moncho's world include his down-to-earth mother (Uxia Blanco), his Republican father, and his older brother, who plays the saxophone with a group of local musicians. However, when the Fascists roll into town, the boy's life changes forever. La Lengua de las Mariposas was screened at the 1999 San Sebastian Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Paper Heart</title>
    <desc lang="en">Real-life sweethearts Michael Cera and Charlyne Yi star in a fictionalized version of their romance in this indie semi-documentary comedy, written by Yi. Playing themselves, Yi and Cera embark on a scripted version of their own story. In the movie, Yi has agreed to be the subject of a documentary about her quest to discover if love really exists, since she's never experienced it. As part of her participation in the project, she has a film crew follow her around throughout every new development in her love life -- which gets complicated when she starts dating fellow comedian Cera. This portion of the film is all narrative, and was written into the script, but also as part of the documentary, Yi travels the country interviewing various people about their opinions and experiences with love, and these portions of the film are real -- the interviewees are not actors. Melding truth and fantasy, Paper Heart uses equal parts comedy and realism to resolve the ultimate question of whether love is fact or fiction(n)</desc>

Once the big-nosed girl next door, she has had a nose job and is a successful journalist in London. Her old flame Andy is still working for philandering novelist Nicholas Hardiment and his long-suffering wife and, when Tamara begins a relationship with rock drummer Ben Sergeant, there begins a three-way contest for her affections, made more complicated by the dreams of 15-year-old Jody, who wants to grow up and get away from the village just like Tamara.Dir: Stephen Frears.

    <desc lang="en">Film adaptation of Alan Bennett's acclaimed stage play set in the north of England in the 1980s. Eight school pupils studying history pursue an undergraduate place at Oxford or Cambridge. Their headmaster is determined to see them break records and enlists a new teacher to coach the boys into intellectual shape. Seduced though they are by his promises, the boys are concerned that there is more to learning than exams and grades, and become caught in a clash of education styles and loyalties.Dir: Nicholas Hytner(n)</desc>

Small-time con man Charlie (Walter Matthau) fast-talks his considerably more straight-laced friend Herb (Jack Lemmon) into joining him for a luxury cruise on an ocean liner headed to the Bahamas. Charlie tells Herb that the trip is free and will be a good way to meet rich widows; both parts are true enough, but Herb doesn't know that Charlie has signed them on as dance hosts (hence the free tickets), and Herb isn't sure if he's ready for romance after the recent death of his wife. As the men struggle with the fact that Herb isn't much of a hoofer (and Charlie can't dance at all) under the strict tutelage of cruise director Godwyn (Brent Spiner), Charlie starts sweet-talking beautiful heiress Liz (Dyan Cannon), while Herb finds a soul mate in Vivian (Gloria DeHaven), who lost her husband not long ago.

    <title lang="en">Slaughter</title>
    <desc lang="en">A typical gangland killing has an unusual outcome when the victim's son comes looking for justice in this violent blaxploitation action drama. Slaughter (Jim Brown) is a former Green Beret who is a decorated war hero, but while he's devoted his life to fighting for right, his father followed another path as a gangster. However, while Slaughter's dad was a career criminal, his mother played no part in his actions, and when they're both killed in a car explosion, Slaughter is determined to get revenge. Slaughter is convinced a rival crime boss ordered the bombing, and plans a daring raid where he kills the suspect. Slaughter is captured by police, and angry detective A.W. Price (Cameron Mitchell) tells Slaughter he had the right idea but the wrong man. Slaughter is persuaded to team up with undercover detectives Harry (Don Gordon) and Kim (Marlene Clark) as they travel to Puerto Rico in hopes of infiltrating the operations of hot-headed mobster Hoffo (Rip Torn). The cops have learned that Hoffo and his cronies are computerizing their operations and they're looking for hard evidence, but Slaughter is more interested in taking down Hoffo, and he'll do whatever it takes. The rivalry between Slaughter and Hoffo becomes all the more bitter when Slaughter becomes involved with Ann (Stella Stevens), the gangster's beautiful girlfriend. Featuring a dynamic theme song by Billy Preston, Slaughter was a major box-office hit in 1972 and one of the most popular films of Jim Brown's screen career; it spawned a sequel, Slaughter's Big Rip-Off, which appeared in 1973(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Which Way Is Up?</title>
    <desc lang="en">This Americanized remake of Lina Wertmuller's The Seduction of Mimi offered audiences the novelty of seeing Richard Pryor performing three different roles in the same film. Which Way Is Up? tells the tale of Leroy Jones (Pryor), a poor orange picker who gets fired from his job when he accidentally joins a worker's union during a demonstration. He is forced to travel to Los Angeles and abandon his family, which includes his wife, Annie Mae (Margaret Avery), and his perpetually randy father, Rufus (also Pryor). While there, he falls in love with labor organizer Vanetta (Lonette McKee), but is soon rehired by his former employers when they realize he is easily manipulated. Back home, Leroy discovers his new managerial role alienates him from his former friends as he tries to divide his time between Annie Mae and Vanetta. When he discovers Annie Mae has been impregnated by the Reverend Lennox Thomas (Pryor's 3rd role) during his absence, Leroy sets his sights on seducing Lennox's wife. The resulting film had ambition to spare, but was generally panned as an inferior remake by the critics and failed to find a mass audience. However, Which Way Is Up? gained a second lease on life via cable and home video and has become a cult favorite with Pryor's fans(n)</desc>
