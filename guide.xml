    <title lang="en">The Crew</title>
    <desc lang="en">In this dark comedy, a group of retirees wants to save their homes -- but they're not typical senior citizens trying to make the most of their Social Security checks. Four aging former mobsters -- Joey "Bats" Pistella (Burt Reynolds), Bobby Bartellemeo (Richard Dreyfuss), Mike the Brick (Dan Hedaya), and Tony "The Mouth" Donato (Seymour Cassel) -- live in the same rundown Miami apartment complex, the Raj Mahal. New owners hope to clear out the current tenants and replace them with a younger, more lucrative clientele. But the veteran gangsters don't want to move, so to scrape up the extra rent money, they take a job executing the father of a Miami mob boss. They happen to know he's already dead, so all they have to do is make it look like they did the hit. Their problems start when loudmouthed ladies' man Tony tells too much to Ferris (Jennifer Tilly), a stripper, and soon she's talked him into murdering her mother (Lainie Kazan) in exchange for her silence. The Crew also features Carrie-Anne Moss as a detective and Jeremy Piven as a mob kingpin out to avenge his father's death(n)</desc>

The most noteworthy change from the original version was the absence of Regis Philbin's familiar catchphrases: One would never hear Meredith Vieira chime in with the legendary "Is that your final answer?" The syndicated Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? was launched on September 16, 2002(n)</desc>

The girls' father is a prison warden who has been overthrown and put behind bars by a gangster. The Stooges decide that their best tactic is to get tossed behind bars themselves, but they find it harder than they expected. A cop they annoy tells them, "Our jail is for important people!" Finally they manage to sneak in and locate their father-in-law to be. He explains that there is a party going on inside the prison and suggests that they surreptitiously take a lot of incriminating photos. So the boys crash the party, after they've managed to steal some tuxedos, and go to work. Unfortunately, Curly's tux proceeds to fall apart in front of his dance partner. By the time he's down to his underwear, Moe has enough pictures and they escape. The real crooks are served justice, and the Stooges marry their sweethearts. They head off for their honeymoon, but not before showering Curly with a rain of shoes(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Margot Fonteyn inspired generations of ballerinas, while her late-flowering partnership with Rudolf Nureyev created the most dazzling ballet partnership in history.

The former ballerina goes behind the scenes at the Royal Opera House and the Royal Ballet, and travels from London to New York and Panama, discovering that Margot did eventually find a kind of happiness - though one that came at a high price.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A down-on-his luck auteur gets one more chance at the big time -- provided his neuroses don't swallow him whole -- in Woody Allen's 33rd feature release, Hollywood Ending. Allen plays Val Waxman, a one-time cinematic genius who's resorted to taking advertisement work to pay the bills for himself and his airhead live-in girlfriend, Lori (Debra Messing). Val finds his luck is about to change, however, when he receives the script for The City Never Sleeps , a period noir set against the backdrop of 1940s New York City. It seems his ex-wife, Ellie (Tea Leoni), now an executive at Galaxy Pictures, has been pulling for him to direct the picture, claiming he's the only man who can do justice to the script. She even manages to convince her boyfriend, Hal (Treat Williams), Galaxy's high-powered studio head, to take a chance on Val's "unique vision." Just when the cameras are ready to roll, however, Val finds that unique vision in jeopardy -- literally -- as he's struck with a psychosomatic case of blindness. When physicians and psychiatrists fail to cure him, Val contrives a scheme to forge ahead with the picture, for fear of blowing his one last chance at greatness. Hollywood Ending co-stars George Hamilton and Mark Rydell(n)</desc>

Val finds his luck is about to change, however, when he receives the script for The City Never Sleeps , a period noir set against the backdrop of 1940s New York City. It seems his ex-wife, Ellie (Tea Leoni), now an executive at Galaxy Pictures, has been pulling for him to direct the picture, claiming he's the only man who can do justice to the script. She even manages to convince her boyfriend, Hal (Treat Williams), Galaxy's high-powered studio head, to take a chance on Val's "unique vision." Just when the cameras are ready to roll, however, Val finds that unique vision in jeopardy -- literally -- as he's struck with a psychosomatic case of blindness. When physicians and psychiatrists fail to cure him, Val contrives a scheme to forge ahead with the picture, for fear of blowing his one last chance at greatness. Hollywood Ending co-stars George Hamilton and Mark Rydell(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Come celebrate the joy and togetherness of the Hanukkah season with Adam Sandler -- yeah, that Adam Sandler -- in this raucous animated comedy written and produced in collaboration with the noted funnyman. Davey Stone (voice of Adam Sandler) is a twentysomething man with a short temper and a reputation for causing trouble who lives in the small New England town of Dukesberry. Davey has a particularly bad attitude about the holiday season, and on the first night of Hanukkah, he goes on a tear that lands him in front of a judge (voice of Norm Crosby). The judge, who has dealt with Davey before, is prepared to send him to prison, but Whitey (also voiced by Sandler), an eccentric but kindly old man, persuades the judge to give him a chance to turn Davey into a more responsible citizen. Davey doesn't think much of Whitey's charitable nature, but when his trailer home burns down, he's forced to move in with Whitey and his perpetually nervous sister, Eleanore (also voiced by Sandler...spotting a trend here?). Between Whitey and Eleanore's nonstop kvetching and the reappearance of his old girlfriend Jennifer (voice of Jackie Titone), Davey is being driven to distraction by the Hanukkah season, but in time Whitey learns the truth about why Davey has such a problem with the Festival of Lights. Adam Sandler's Eight Crazy Nights also includes eight new songs co-written by Sandler; he duets with bluegrass star Alison Krauss on "Long Ago."(n)</desc>

Jeremy Clarkson chooses a Volkswagen Up for the journey, while Richard Hammond takes a Ford Fiesta and James May opts for a Dacia Sandero. On their adventure, the trio absorb the history of the Crimean Peninsula, including a visit to an old submarine pen - but the carefree exploration looks likely to become a chore when Jeremy, Richard and James are challenged to a long drive north through the expansive country, during which they must combat serious boredom. And as if that wasn't arduous enough, a new task is set when they arrive in Kiev - a trip into the wasteland of Chernobyl.

A boy's future hangs on the outcome of a single horse race in the vast grasslands of the Steppe, and in a European salt marsh, a young man duels with a savage bull in a centuries-old battle of wills.(n)</desc>

In the early 1980s, a hastily assembled army of Afghan "freedom fighters" achieved the remarkable feat of fending off Soviet invaders despite the fact that the odds were overwhelmingly stacked against them. At the time, Texas congressman Charlie Wilson (Hanks) was a key member of the hugely powerful House Appropriations Committee. Illuminated to the specifics of this remarkable war by a high-profile Houston socialite, Wilson spearheaded an effort to provide hundreds of millions of dollars in weapons and training to the Mujahideen with more than a little help from brilliant but prickly CIA operative Gust Avrokotos(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Set 100 miles south of the setting of the Polish brothers' first feature, Twin Falls Idaho, Jackpot tells the story of Sunny Holiday Jon Gries, a down-on-his-luck karaoke dweller who has hopes of becoming a country singer. He has abandoned his feisty wife Bobbi (Daryl Hannah) and young daughter to set off on a nine-month road odyssey with his manager Lester Irving (Garrett Morris), in an effort to collect cash at local karaoke gigs. Lester grooms Sunny by choosing what songs he will do, keeping up with what the judges are like, and negotiating with competitors like Sammy Bones (Mac Davis), another traveling hopeful. On his road journey, he encounters several women, including Janice (Peggy Lipton), a club waitress, and Cheryl (Crystal Bernard), whom he takes home after she has an accident in a restroom, only to find himself being enticed by her underage daughter Tangerine (Camellia Clouse). The road trip comes to a stop, however, when Sunny is pulled over by police who claim that his vehicle is stolen and that Bobbi has reported it. Sunny then seeks refuge with brother Tracy (Anthony Edwards) while he decides his next move. Jackpot is the first released film to be shot with the 24P HDTV camera, which was then blown up to Cinemascope 35 mm format(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Following their television series Home Improvement and the features The Santa Clause (1994) and Jungle 2 Jungle (1997), the actor/director team of Tim Allen and John Pasquin collaborate once again on this high-concept comedy. Allen stars as Joe Scheffer, a nice guy video specialist for a Minneapolis pharmaceutical company who's plodding through both his thankless job and an unhappy divorce from his ex-wife Callie (Kelly Lynch). When Joe brings his daughter Natalie (Hayden Panettiere) to the office with him on Take Our Kids to Work Day, he's humiliated in a spat with company bully Mark McKinney (Patrick Warburton) over a parking space. It's the last straw for the mild-mannered Joe, who challenges McKinney to a rematch, hires a has-been action movie star (Jim Belushi) to instruct him in martial arts, and pays a stylist to make over his wardrobe and hair. As Joe's image improves and the big day approaches, he finds his new self-respecting stance has positive effects in both the workplace, as he lands a long-overdue promotion, and in his romantic life, as both Callie and a cute "wellness coordinator" (Julie Bowen) start warming up to him. The levelheaded Natalie, however, seems to prefer the previously non-confrontational dad she already loved. Joe Somebody (2001) is the feature debut of screenwriter John Scott Shepherd, who actually worked as a corporate filmmaker in Minneapolis(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">After decades of movies about college sports, the bands who take the field at halftime finally get their day in the sun in this musical comedy drama. Devon Miles (Nick Cannon) is a talented young percussionist from Harlem who wins a music scholarship to Atlanta A &amp; T, a prestigious African-American university. For years, Atlanta A &amp; T has won awards for their show-style marching band, who combine expert musicianship (incorporating funk, R&amp;B, and jazz rhythms into the traditional marching band repertoire) with choreography, dancing cheerleaders, and roof-raising showmanship. Dr. Aaron Lee (Orlando Jones), the school's band director, gives Devon a spot in the marching band's drumline, the heart and soul of a show-style band, but discovers Devon's previous musical education hardly meets his usual standard when he learns that his new drummer can't read music. Devon soon earns a reputation as a stubborn individualist within the band, not necessarily a good thing in an ensemble where a strictly unified performance is considers the ideal. Devon's cocksure attitude and streetwise style doesn't mesh very comfortably with Sean Taylor (Leonard Roberts), a disciplined senior who resents the presence of the upstart freshman in the drumline, and things become even less harmonious when Devon begins making a play for Laila (Zoe Saldana), a beautiful girl who is also being courted by Sean. Songwriter and record producer Dallas Austin, who has worked with Boyz II Men, TLC, and Pink, served as executive producer for Drumline, helped produce the film's musical score, and contributed his own experiences as a marching band member to the screenplay(n)</desc>

The year is 2027, and women can no longer give birth. The youngest inhabitant of the planet has just died at the age of 18, and all hope for humanity has been lost. As civilization descends into chaos, a dying world finds one last chance for survival in the form of a woman who has become inexplicably pregnant. Now, as warring nationalistic sects clash and British leaders try to maintain their totalitarian stronghold on the country, a disillusioned bureaucrat (Clive Owen) is brought back into the fold of activism by his guerrilla ex-wife (Julianne Moore). Reluctantly, he takes on the daunting task of escorting Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey), the refugee who represents humankind's last hope for survival, out of harm's way and into the care of a mysterious organization known as The Human Project.

After a botched job, they're sent by their boss Harry Waters (Ralph Fiennes) to hide out in Bruges. Ken loves the city and its history; Ray hates it, until he hooks up with beautiful drugs dealer Chloe and a mouthy dwarf actor, Jimmy. Unfortunately, just as life seems to be improving for the two hitmen, psychopathic Harry phones to deliver stark instructions: the nature of the botched hit has offended his sense of morality and he's decided to break up the partnership, ordering one of the duo to kill the other. This tests the bond linking the three men, and leads to a violent denouement in the ancient city's cobbled streets(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Cilla</title>
    <desc lang="en">Sheridan Smith takes the lead role in Jeff Pope's three-part drama charting Cilla Black's rise to fame in the 1960s. As the series opens, Priscilla White is a Liverpool typist with dreams of escaping the office and becoming a singer. It looks like her chance has come when she meets songwriter Bobby Willis, who claims to be in the music industry - so she's less than impressed to later discover his flash car is hired and he actually works in a bakery. Despite this inauspicious start, Cilla agrees to let him manage her, but will their arrangement still stand after her friends, a local band by the name of the Beatles, help her land an audition with genuine impresario Brian Epstein? Aneurin Barnard, Ed Stoppard and John Henshaw also star.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Cilla</title>
    <desc lang="en">Reunited with Bobby, Cilla's confidence returns and she once again dazzles crowds with her vocal talents. The re-emergence of impresario Brian Epstein then propels her career to greater heights, but this is quickly followed by a new low when her first record fails to set the charts alight, despite being written by two local lads called John Lennon and Paul McCartney. Epstein suggests a change of direction, persuading the singer to take a gamble on the ballad Anyone Who Had a Heart, against her future husband's advice. Continuing Jeff Pope's three-part biopic charting Cilla Black's rise to fame in 1960s Liverpool, starring Sheridan Smith, with Aneurin Barnard and Ed Stoppard.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Cilla</title>
    <desc lang="en">It looks like Cilla has put that early botched audition and those disappointing record sales behind her as, following the success of Anyone Who Had a Heart, her new single You're My World becomes her second number one. However, while she may have conquered the UK charts, can she follow in the footsteps of her old mates the Beatles and crack America? The signs aren't looking good, and just to add to the pressure, her relationship with Bobby is becoming increasingly tumultuous. But as her manager Brian Epstein's private life starts to spiral out of control, it seems there could be an even bigger threat to Cilla's new-found success. The concluding instalment of Jeff Pope's biopic charting Cilla Black's rise to fame, starring Sheridan Smith, Aneurin Barnard and Ed Stoppard.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Descent editor Jon Harris makes the leap to the director's chair in this sequel to Neil Marshall's claustrophobic 2005 creature flick. Sarah Carter (Shauna MacDonald) has managed to escape from the Appalachian cave system where all of her friends were killed by "crawlers" -- primordial humanoids who have adapted to living in the subterranean darkness. In hopes that some of the spelunkers may have survived, Sheriff Redmond Vaines rounds up his deputies for a rescue mission, and decides to take Sarah along as a guide. At first Sarah has no memory of the horrors that wait below, but the further the team pushes into the cave, the more vivid her flashbacks become until the reality of the situation sinks in. Now, the rescue crew is being hunted from the shadows by a whole new clan of crawlers that are even more vicious and terrifying than their predecessors. Sarah was lucky to make it out of the caves alive the first time -- will that luck carry over into her second descent, or is she doomed to die while dreaming of escaping into the sunlight?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Descent editor Jon Harris makes the leap to the director's chair in this sequel to Neil Marshall's claustrophobic 2005 creature flick. Sarah Carter (Shauna MacDonald) has managed to escape from the Appalachian cave system where all of her friends were killed by "crawlers" -- primordial humanoids who have adapted to living in the subterranean darkness. In hopes that some of the spelunkers may have survived, Sheriff Redmond Vaines rounds up his deputies for a rescue mission, and decides to take Sarah along as a guide. At first Sarah has no memory of the horrors that wait below, but the further the team pushes into the cave, the more vivid her flashbacks become until the reality of the situation sinks in. Now, the rescue crew is being hunted from the shadows by a whole new clan of crawlers that are even more vicious and terrifying than their predecessors. Sarah was lucky to make it out of the caves alive the first time -- will that luck carry over into her second descent, or is she doomed to die while dreaming of escaping into the sunlight?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Relegated to a forlorn afterlife of unsmiling lost souls and melancholy drifters as a result of committing suicide in the mortal realm, a heartbroken young man sets out to find the girl who inspired his final act of self-destruction after learning that she too has taken her own life in director Goran Dukic's adaptation of Etgar Keret's darkly comic novella Kneller's Happy Campers. A likeable young man despite his depressive disposition, Zia (Patrick Fugit) puts blade to wrist only to find that the pain of life doesn't end with the coming of death. Now trapped in a bleak metaphysical landscape populated entirely by suicide victims blearily searching for the joys that eluded them in the physical realm, Zia soon learns that the love is one of the latest arrivals in the dreary land of the dead. As Zia sets out to locate his ill-fated former companion and experience the joys that eluded the couple in life, he is joined in his quest by a lovelorn Russian rocker named Eugene (Shea Wigham) and an accidental tourist named Mikal (Shannyn Sossamon), who's looking for a way out of the sorrowful stir(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Winter Passing</title>
    <desc lang="en">Money and emotions lead to a difficult reunion between a father and daughter in this drama. Reese Holden (Zooey Deschanel) is a struggling stage actress in New York City whose life has become an uphill struggle -- her career isn't giving her satisfaction, her relationship with would-be rock star Ray (Dallas Roberts) is stuck in neutral, an affair with her friend Rob (Robert Beitzel) brings no excitement, and her colleague Deirdre (Deirdre O'Connell) simply doesn't understand her problems. Reese is also short on money, which is why she's willing to listen to a proposal from a publisher who wants to release a series of love letters that her mother, a well-known author who died years ago, wrote to her father, Don (Ed Harris), another respected novelist who has fallen out of the limelight but is said to be working on a final major work. Having accepted an advance for the collection, Reese pays a visit to Don in Michigan to get his OK for the project and collect the letters, but discovers two strangers have moved in with Don -- Shelly (Amelia Warner), who studied under Don and has installed herself as his business manager, and Corbit (Will Ferrell), a neighborhood sad sack who helps with the housekeeping and runs errands for the reclusive writer. As Reese vies with Shelly for her father's attention, she struggles to come to terms with issues from her childhood and the dissatisfaction with her life. Winter Passing was written and directed by noted playwright Adam Rapp; it was his first feature film(n)</desc>

As these three men and their underlings scramble for money and power, another player is quietly consolidating his forces and rising up against them.

Stine's Goosebumps series, this made-for-TV vampire tale stars Chauncey Leopardi as Zach, a teenage rebel with a flair for telling ghost stories, who stumbles on an underground cabal of vampires when he takes a fateful ride on a New York subway. The vampire's leader, Valentine (Ron Silver), proposes a deal to young Zach, offering him safe passage to the world above, thus enabling the trapped vampire -- who can only mingle with humanity through the willing assistance of an innocent youth -- to reach the surface as well. Our young hero balks at this idea and escapes to the surface with a wild story for his skeptical pals, who shun him until one of their number is kidnapped by the undead subway dwellers in exchange for Zach's cooperation. Though atmospherically photographed, this low-budget production is a bit too corny to provide either laughs or chills, and it suffers further from lethargic pacing(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Actor, writer, and director Tim Blake Nelson adapts this grim look at the holocaust from his own play, based on Miklos Nyiszli's book, Auschwitz: A Doctor's Eyewitness Account. The film centers on the sonderkommando: Jewish concentration camp prisoners whose job was to herd their fellow Jews into the gas chamber, and to dispose of the bodies following the execution. In return, these prisoners received food and a little more time before their own executions. As the members of the sonderkommando struggle to orchestrate what would be the only armed insurrection in Auschwitz, a group of them discover a 14-year-old girl who somehow survived the gas chamber. The girl becomes a symbol for their own spiritual salvation and they become obsessed with keeping the girl alive, even if it endangers the uprising that could save thousands. This film was screened at the 2001 Toronto Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Musketeer</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Peter Hyams brings the modern choreography talents of famed Hong Kong fight sequence designer Xin Xin Xiong to this action adventure that departs widely from its classic novel source material, focusing exclusively on the D'Artagnan character and either excising other characters completely or relegating them to minor supporting roles. Justin Chambers stars as D'Artagnan, a country-bred lad whose skill with a sword has led to aspirations of becoming a Musketeer, one of the French king's elite guard. Upon arriving in Paris, however, he finds that the Musketeers have been disbanded by order of Cardinal Richelieu (Stephen Rea), who is usurping the king's authority with the help of a lethally gifted henchman, Febre (Tim Roth). Soon, D'Artagnan is embroiled in an effort to prevent a war between his native country and England, meeting up with a beautiful love interest (Mena Suvari) along the way. As he has often done before, director Hyams doubles as his own cinematographer(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">The One with the Prom Video</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The One with the Prom Video. Episode 38 is memorable for the video of Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) and Monica (Courteney Cox) preparing for their senior prom. Featuring a pre-nose surgery Rachel, an overweight Monica -- in an awful poofy, red dress -- and Ross (David Schwimmer) sporting a moustache and curly hair combo that would even make Gabe Kaplan wince, this is funny stuff. Ross makes a list about Rachel's attributes that angers her, causing her to swear that they will never get together as a couple. Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) tries to console Ross with her theory that Rachel is his lobster and therefore they are meant for each other. She says, "You can actually see old lobster couples walking around their tank, you know, holding claws like...." The video shows up in some things Monica's parents bring over because they are renovating her room into a gym. In the video, Rachel is stood up by her date and Ross' dad privately urges him to put on a tux and accompany her to the prom. Ross, clearly enamored with Rachel, fights his insecurity and agrees to do it. As Ross comes beaming down the stairs, Rachel's date shows up and a defeated Ross escapes to his room. Seeing Ross' chivalrous compassion for the first time, Rachel immediately forgives him for making his list and kisses him. Of course, the real joy is watching the video that allows Chandler (Matthew Perry) and Joey (Matt LeBlanc) to get off some juicy one-liners about how nerdy everyone looks. There is also great subplot involving a garish gold bracelet that Joey -- now earning money -- gives to Chandler. This episode originally aired on February 1, 1996(n)</desc>

Skeeter (Emma Stone) has just graduated from college, and she's eager to launch her career as a writer. In a moment of inspiration, Skeeter decides to focus her attention on the black female servants who work in her community. Her first subject is Aibileen (Viola Davis), the devoted housekeeper who has been employed by Skeeter's best friend's family for years. By speaking with Aibileen, Skeeter becomes an object of scorn to the wealthy locals, who view her actions as directly challenging to the established social order. Before long, even more servants are coming forward to tell their stories, and Skeeter discovers that friendship can blossom under the most unlikely of circumstances. Bryce Dallas Howard co-stars in a touching tale of race relations based on author Kathryn Stockett's best-selling novel of the same name(n)</desc>
