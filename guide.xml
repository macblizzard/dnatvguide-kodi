    <title lang="en">The Banger Sisters</title>
    <desc lang="en">For some folks, the 1960s never really ended, and one woman still cheerfully stuck in the Summer of Love discovers her one-time best friend has left that decade as far behind as humanly possible in this comedy. In the late '60s and early '70s, Suzette (Goldie Hawn) and Vinnie (Susan Sarandon) were two of Southern California's most celebrated groupies. Affectionately nicknamed "The Banger Sisters" by Frank Zappa, best friends Suzette and Vinnie partied hearty with practically every rock star of the era who mattered, and kept a collection of Polaroid snapshots documenting their randy exploits. In 2001, Suzette is still her free-spirited self, and after losing her job as a barmaid at an L.A. rock club, she decides to look up Vinnie, whom she hasn't seen for 20 years. Suzette hits the road for Phoenix, AZ, to pay Vinnie a surprise visit, and en route picks up Harry (Geoffrey Rush), a novelist with writer's block who can't drive and hasn't had sex for a decade. Upon her arrival, Suzette discovers Vinnie isn't quite the same person who used to chase any man with long hair and an electric guitar. Now going by her given name of Lavinia, she's a straight laced social worker with a lawyer for a husband, Raymond (Robin Thomas), and two teenage daughters, Hannah (Erika Christensen) and Ginger (Eva Amurri), none of whom know a thing about her wild and crazy past, and have a pretty hard time imagining Lavinia even attending a rock concert. Eva Amurri comes by her role as Susan Sarandon's daughter naturally enough -- Amurri is Sarandon's daughter in real life(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Who Wants to Be a Millionaire</title>
    <desc lang="en">Although the once-hot game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? had lost its luster as a prime-time ABC offering, the producers felt that there was enough life left in the property to warrant a Monday-through-Friday syndicated version. Taking over from the earlier series' host Regis Philbin was Meredith Vieira of The View. To make certain that the series would not be bankrupted after its first week on the air, the questions posed to contestants were considerably harder than those on the prime-time incarnation. Also, the famous "fastest finger" round was eliminated, taking some of the pressure off the contestants when they struggled to come up with answers. The most noteworthy change from the original version was the absence of Regis Philbin's familiar catchphrases: One would never hear Meredith Vieira chime in with the legendary "Is that your final answer?" The syndicated Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? was launched on September 16, 2002(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Mothman Prophecies</title>
    <desc lang="en">Based on a book by paranormal investigator John Keel, this spooky, X-Files-type supernatural thriller is purportedly based loosely on true events that occurred in the small town of Point Pleasant, WV, in 1966-1967. Richard Gere stars as journalist John Klein, an up-and-coming reporter devastated by the death of his beloved wife Mary (Debra Messing) following a car accident. Mary saw a mysterious vision immediately before the crash, a haunting image of a moth-like creature. Two years later, Klein is driving to an interview with the governor of Virginia when he suddenly finds himself hundreds of miles out of his way in a small town on the West Virginia-Ohio border. He discovers that strange events are occurring there, including sightings of the "mothman," as well as UFOs and bizarre alien-like telephone calls. Klein stays to investigate, despite the protests of skeptical cop Connie Parker (Laura Linney) and the initial hostility of spooked local Gordon (Will Patton). He soon discovers that sightings of the mothman are historical portents of doom and disaster, omens that may foretell a terrible cataclysm about to strike Point Pleasant. The Mothman Prophecies reunites Gere and Linney, who previously starred together in Primal Fear (1996)(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In the early 1960s drum shop owner Jim Marshall launched the loudest amplifier in the world at a point in time widely perceived to be the birth of rock. Young musicians like Clapton and Hendrix rushed to adopt the revolutionary `Marshall sound', and the electric guitar spoke for a new generation, while stacks and walls became an essential backdrop at concerts. The company was rescued from financial meltdown by comic exposure in the 1984 movie This is Spinal Tap, and the electronic boxes were propelled to iconic status. This documentary charts the amp's history, with contributions from rock musicians Pete Townshend, Lemmy and Slash, plus an interview with the founder himself.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Richard Hammond presents this chilly version of Total Wipeout, which sees the contestants wrapping up warm to tackle a snow-covered course with winter-themed obstacles and seasonal challenges. They must manoeuvre themselves past Granny's House, watching out for the angry dog nipping at their ankles and a front door guaranteed to smack them in the face. They then cling onto the ski lift to avoid plunging into the icy waters, before riding the conveyor belt that throws them onto those old Wipeout favourites, the big red balls. Amanda Byram laughs it up at the side of the course.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Adele Story</title>
    <desc lang="en">Documentary charting the remarkable career trajectory of Adele Adkins, the pop and soul singer who rose from humble beginnings in Tottenham to become one of the biggest stars of the modern music industry. Now popular enough to warrant going by her forename only, Adele's interest in music was encouraged by her mother from an early age. Winning a place at the Brit School in Croydon, Adele first shot into the public eye when her friend uploaded a demo to MySpace in 2006, and by the time she graduated, the singer had already secured a record deal. What followed were three hugely successful albums, 19, 21 and 25, each of which surpassed the last in terms of critical acclaim and sales figures. Adele also scored an Oscar in 2013 for her song Skyfall, which featured as the theme of the James Bond film of the same name.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Legendary Hong Kong action director and choreographer Corey Yuen brings Tecmo's best-selling video-game franchise to the big screen in a martial arts extravaganza featuring an impressive quartet of female fighters including Devon Aoki, Sarah Carter, Jaime Pressly, and Holly Valance. Tina (Pressly), Christie (Valance), Kasumi (Aoki), and Helena (Carter) are four skilled martial artists whose outwardly sexy appearances betray their true lethal natures. When the fearsome females each receive an invitation to take part in an illegal martial arts competition to be staged on a remote Asian island, the prospect of a ten-million-dollar top prize is only sweetened by the fact that they will be facing off against some of the toughest fighters on the planet. Now, in order to defend their honor and search for the answers to life's greatest mysteries, Tina, Christie, Kasumi, and Helena will check their inhibitions at the beach and prepare for a series of fights that will test not only their strength, stamina, and endurance, but the very foundation of their dedication to the martial arts as well(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Leatherheads</title>
    <desc lang="en">Good Night, and Good Luck director George Clooney pulls double duty once again in this sports-oriented romantic comedy set against the formation of professional football in the 1920s. Dodge Connelly (Clooney) is a brash and handsome gridiron giant who is equally comfortable leading his team in a barroom brawl or charging for a touchdown in a packed stadium. But when Connelly's team loses their sponsor and the entire league appears set to collapse, the quick-thinking jock attempts a creative late-game comeback. If Connelly can convince former college football star and decorated war hero Carter Rutherford (John Krasinski) to join the team, there may be hope for the ill-fated team after all. Back in World War I, Rutherford single-handedly forced the surrender of multiple German soldiers -- a feat that firmly established the dashing young soldier as America's favorite son. Not only that, but Rutherford's unparalleled speed makes him a valuable asset to the team. To cub reporter Lexie Littleton (Renée Zellweger), Rutherford seems simply too good to be true, and she's determined to prove that her theory is correct. As Littleton digs deep into Rutherford's past, the two teammates enter into a fierce competition for her erratic affections. Now, as Connelly's plan begins to work better than he ever could have anticipated, the rowdy sport he always loved starts to take on a whole new look and feel. In the midst of holding his team together and simultaneously charming the girl of his dreams, Connelly discovers he may be able to use the same strategies he does to win on the field to win in love. Of course, there might be a few fouls as this game enters the fourth quarter, but like every good player, Connelly knows the value of always having a secret play to fall back on before the final score is called(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Harold &amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay</title>
    <desc lang="en">After successfully seeking out the ultimate slider in the 2004 stoner comedy Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle, the cannabis-craving twosome returns in this high-flying sequel that finds them labeled terrorists for attempting to sneak a marijuana-smoking implement on a flight to Amsterdam. Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) have just finished gorging themselves on savory White Castle hamburgers when they return to their apartment and hatch a plan for Harold to win the heart of his crush, Maria (Paula Garcés). Maria is going to Amsterdam, and if Harold can catch up with her overseas perhaps he can strike up a real love connection. After a close call with airport personnel and a chance encounter with Kumar's ex-girlfriend Vanessa (Danneel Harris) -- who hadn't yet told Kumar that she's engaged to be married -- the pot-loving pals finally board their flight for Amsterdam. Unfortunately for Harold, Kumar isn't able to endure the lengthy flight without an innocent puff or two from his smokeless bong. When the plane hits some turbulence and the bong is mistaken for a bomb, the flight is diverted to Guantanamo Bay and our spliff-smoking heroes are detained by overzealous Deputy Chief of Homeland Security Ron Fox (Rob Corddry). Now, if they can just escape from the world's most notorious prison compound, perhaps this hapless duo can succeed in convincing the authorities that they aren't enemy combatants, and that Kumar made the mistake of his life by letting Vanessa go. But before they can prove their innocence and get the girls, Harold and Kumar will have to outsmart the dreaded Ku Klux Klan, contend with a particularly precocious Cyclops baby, and successfully elude everyone's favorite debauched former child star -- Neil Patrick Harris(n)</desc>

Tina (Pressly), Christie (Valance), Kasumi (Aoki), and Helena (Carter) are four skilled martial artists whose outwardly sexy appearances betray their true lethal natures. When the fearsome females each receive an invitation to take part in an illegal martial arts competition to be staged on a remote Asian island, the prospect of a ten-million-dollar top prize is only sweetened by the fact that they will be facing off against some of the toughest fighters on the planet. Now, in order to defend their honor and search for the answers to life's greatest mysteries, Tina, Christie, Kasumi, and Helena will check their inhibitions at the beach and prepare for a series of fights that will test not only their strength, stamina, and endurance, but the very foundation of their dedication to the martial arts as well(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Leatherheads</title>
    <desc lang="en">Good Night, and Good Luck director George Clooney pulls double duty once again in this sports-oriented romantic comedy set against the formation of professional football in the 1920s. Dodge Connelly (Clooney) is a brash and handsome gridiron giant who is equally comfortable leading his team in a barroom brawl or charging for a touchdown in a packed stadium. But when Connelly's team loses their sponsor and the entire league appears set to collapse, the quick-thinking jock attempts a creative late-game comeback. If Connelly can convince former college football star and decorated war hero Carter Rutherford (John Krasinski) to join the team, there may be hope for the ill-fated team after all. Back in World War I, Rutherford single-handedly forced the surrender of multiple German soldiers -- a feat that firmly established the dashing young soldier as America's favorite son. Not only that, but Rutherford's unparalleled speed makes him a valuable asset to the team. To cub reporter Lexie Littleton (Renée Zellweger), Rutherford seems simply too good to be true, and she's determined to prove that her theory is correct. As Littleton digs deep into Rutherford's past, the two teammates enter into a fierce competition for her erratic affections. Now, as Connelly's plan begins to work better than he ever could have anticipated, the rowdy sport he always loved starts to take on a whole new look and feel. In the midst of holding his team together and simultaneously charming the girl of his dreams, Connelly discovers he may be able to use the same strategies he does to win on the field to win in love. Of course, there might be a few fouls as this game enters the fourth quarter, but like every good player, Connelly knows the value of always having a secret play to fall back on before the final score is called(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Harold &amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay</title>
    <desc lang="en">After successfully seeking out the ultimate slider in the 2004 stoner comedy Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle, the cannabis-craving twosome returns in this high-flying sequel that finds them labeled terrorists for attempting to sneak a marijuana-smoking implement on a flight to Amsterdam. Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) have just finished gorging themselves on savory White Castle hamburgers when they return to their apartment and hatch a plan for Harold to win the heart of his crush, Maria (Paula Garcés). Maria is going to Amsterdam, and if Harold can catch up with her overseas perhaps he can strike up a real love connection. After a close call with airport personnel and a chance encounter with Kumar's ex-girlfriend Vanessa (Danneel Harris) -- who hadn't yet told Kumar that she's engaged to be married -- the pot-loving pals finally board their flight for Amsterdam. Unfortunately for Harold, Kumar isn't able to endure the lengthy flight without an innocent puff or two from his smokeless bong. When the plane hits some turbulence and the bong is mistaken for a bomb, the flight is diverted to Guantanamo Bay and our spliff-smoking heroes are detained by overzealous Deputy Chief of Homeland Security Ron Fox (Rob Corddry). Now, if they can just escape from the world's most notorious prison compound, perhaps this hapless duo can succeed in convincing the authorities that they aren't enemy combatants, and that Kumar made the mistake of his life by letting Vanessa go. But before they can prove their innocence and get the girls, Harold and Kumar will have to outsmart the dreaded Ku Klux Klan, contend with a particularly precocious Cyclops baby, and successfully elude everyone's favorite debauched former child star -- Neil Patrick Harris(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Hot Tub Time Machine</title>
    <desc lang="en">Steve Pink's boisterous sci-fi comedy stars John Cusack (who also produced), Rob Corddry, Craig Robinson and Clark Duke as four men who find an unusual portal through time. Adam and his friends Nick and Lou are in their 40s and deeply dissatisfied with the way their lives have turned out. Wanting to recapture a little of the hedonism and youthful anarchy of their 20s, they take a trip to a resort they frequented back then for a trip down memory lane. Taking along Adam's nephew Jacob for the ride, they are disappointed to find that the resort is now more or less a ramshackle ruin. However, after realising that its hot tub still works, they discover to their surprise that the fancy bath is in fact a time machine. So, instead of reminiscing about their youth, they get the chance to actually relive it, as all are transported back to 1986. Cue the movie's raison d'être - a satirical look (via the eyes of Jacob) at the ethos of 80s' teen movies and the general mores of the time, as well as an intriguingly honest exploration of the minds of men in the midst of their mid-life crises. Joining in the fun, with extremely game cameos, are Chevy Chase and Crispin Glover(n)</desc>

Despite once being Africa's most successful primate, a species which at one time roamed across the entire continent, these days they are found in one just place in the remote Ethiopian Highlands. Cox investigates why these ancestors retreated, yet modern mankind has expanded across the planet.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">An American tourist in Chile and his newfound friends face a grueling fight for survival following a massive earthquake in this harrowing disaster film starring and co-written by Eli Roth (who penned the screenplay alongside Guillermo Amoedo and director Nicolás López). Good-natured Gringo (Roth) and his two Chilean pals Ariel (Ariel Levy) and Pollo (Nicolás Martínez) are looking to hook up with some ladies when they happen across gorgeous Russian model Irina (Natasha Yarovenko), hard-partying Kylie (Lorenza Izzo), and Kylie's straitlaced older sister Monica (Andrea Osvárt), who agree to join them for an impromptu trip to Valparaiso. But the following night, as the music blares and the club gets jumping, the ground starts to crumble beneath their feet. With chaos in the air and Ariel seriously injured, everyone tries to keep their cool while seeking help for their friend. Little do they realize that this is the beginning of a nightmare from which no one can wake up, and when the inmates escape from a local prison and begin flooding into the streets, the initial shock turns to outright terror as roving gangs of convicts begin to rape, rob, and murder at will(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Fifth Element</title>
    <desc lang="en">The mysterious fifth element when combined with four others creates the ultimate weapon against universal evil. The story begins in 1914 when benign aliens visit an ancient Egyptian temple to steal four stones containing information about this mysterious element. The visitors promise to return to Earth in the future to save it from evil. Three centuries pass and Earth is threatened by a thunderous Cosmic Evil. Unfortunately, the Evil killed the Good aliens who promised to save the planet. Fortunately, Earthlings have a piece of one of the alien saviors. Utilizing DNA restructuring, scientists grow the piece into a perfect new alien which takes the form of a curvaceous, seductive no-holds barred redheaded acrobat who escapes from the lab with the police in hot pursuit. Desperately she dives into a cab reluctantly driven by luckless former special force officer (Bruce Willis) who suddenly finds himself faced with the task of saving the universe by finding the missing stones and vanquishing the evil forces. Featuring dazzling special effects and classy production values coupled with a healthy splash of outlandish high fashion the emphasis of Besson's film is not so much plot as it is over-the top spectacle(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">30 Days of Night</title>
    <desc lang="en">Hard Candy director David Slade took the helm for this adaptation of Steve Niles' terrifying comic-book series of the same name. In Barrow, AK, one night can last an eternity. One month every year, this town is plunged into darkness for 30 days due to its location far north of the Arctic Circle. While extended periods of darkness are something that the locals have become accustomed to, this year something sinister is about to emerge from the long and unforgiving night. As a maniacal horde of vampires assumes control of the city streets and begins to feast freely upon the terrified citizens, the local sheriff (Josh Hartnett), his wife (Melissa George), and a small but resilient band of survivors will be forced to choose between saving themselves or helping the few remaining members of their community survive the blood-soaked siege. Original comic creator Niles collaborated with screenwriters Stuart Beattie and Brian Nelson to pen the film, which was produced under Sam Raimi's Ghost House Pictures banner(n)</desc>

The night at the club is bust, but afterwards Moe passes a flower cart owned by Renee (voice of Helen Hunt); they strike up a conversation and she's taken with his "insecure, sweaty charm." Moe and Renee start dating, and he doesn't hesitate to spend big when they go out, but once his credit card is maxed out, Moe is afraid Renee will lose interest in him. Needing some quick cash, Moe hatches a crackpot scheme in which Homer will "steal" his car while he and Renee are out for the evening, and the insurance settlement will allow him to keep wining and dining his sweetheart. However, rather than park the car on a railroad track as planned, Homer stops at a drive-in showing Hail To The Chimp, and by the end of the evening he's been arrested for Grand Theft Auto. At first, Moe promises to vouch for Homer, but afraid Renee will think less of him, he lets his best friend rot in jail rather than tell the truth.

Destined to be perpetually single, their moronic, klutzy attempts at meeting new women (such as popping the question on a first date in a crowded restaurant) always blow up in their face. Then, one day, the Solomons receive the distressing news that their father is on his deathbed -- and to complicate matters, he indicates that his dying wish involves having a grandchild. John and Dean are happy to oblige -- but where in the world will they find a mother for this infant? Suddenly, the bachelors' romantic desperation doubles, and each brother embarks on a nutty, madcap quest to find the girl of his dreams and the mother of his future children.

As tempers rise and confidence falters, the contestants have one last chance to impress judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry by baking a showstopping choux gateau - before discovering who has earned a place in the 2012 final.

    <sub-title lang="en">Patisserie.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Four bakers remain in the hunt for the title of Britain's best amateur baker, but they all need to raise their game when they tackle a trio of classic patisserie confections in the semi-final. A petits fours-making challenge provides an early test of nerves, before the quartet face the toughest technical task in the show's history - creating a fraisier, a sponge cake filled with mousse and strawberries. As tempers rise and confidence falters, the contestants have one last chance to impress judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry by baking a showstopping choux gateau - before discovering who has earned a place in the 2012 final. Presented by Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc.(n)</desc>

Twenty years later, after saying 'yes' to their respective fiancés, they've instructed their wedding planner to book the ceremony of their dreams. But because of a clerical error they're both given the same slot - and neither is willing to concede. Instead, their friendship is jettisoned as they resort to underhand tactics in a bid to sabotage each other and fulfil their marriage fantasies...

    <title lang="en">Casper</title>
    <desc lang="en">Based on the popular cartoon character, this family-oriented "ghost story" is about a not-so-scary spirit who bonds with a little girl (Christina Ricci). The eternally irritable Ms. Carrigan (Cathy Moriarty) discovers that the only thing she's been left in her recently departed father's will is a rickety old house in New England. Naturally, the woman is furious about this, until her "close personal friend" and assistant, Dibbs (Eric Idle of Monty Python fame), discovers a secret message that a treasure may be concealed somewhere in the house. The two take off for Maine, only to learn that the house is haunted by Casper "the friendly ghost" and his three ghostly uncles Stinky, Stretch, and Fatso. After futilely recruiting an exorcist (Don Novello, more or less reviving his Father Guido Sarducci character from Saturday Night Live) and a "professional ghost exterminator" (Dan Aykroyd), she brings in a "ghost psychiatrist" (Bill Pullman) and his daughter Kat (Ricci). Innocently attracted to the young girl, Casper befriends Kat as they try to save the ghosts' home from the evil Carrigan. Eye-popping special effects highlight this magical story that touches (albeit lightly) on the theme of what lies at the heart of human desires. Clint Eastwood, Rodney Dangerfield, Mel Gibson and The Crypt Keeper (of Tales from the Crypt) all make cameos as apparitions in the mirror Bill Pullman looks into in the house(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Coraline</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Henry Selick (The Nightmare Before Christmas; James and the Giant Peach) delivers a deliciously dark stop-motion animated adventure for children who don't mind a scare or two, based on Neil Gaiman's much-praised book. Coraline Jones and her parents have just moved into the Pink Palaces Apartments in Oregon, where they find themselves surrounded by eccentric neighbours, including a pair of ageing burlesque performers. It should be an exciting time, but Coraline's parents are too busy working as horticultural journalists to spend any time with her, so she is deeply bored. That is until she discovers a mysterious door that only appears after dark. Bold and inquisitive, the youngster investigates. She discovers a brightly coloured alternative universe, where her 'Other Mother' has plenty of time to play with her and her neighbours' quirks are charmingly exaggerated; in fact, she's tempted to stay. But all is not as it seems: everyone in the new world has buttons for eyes - and the operation to install them involves knitting needles. And that revelation is just the first of her shocking discoveries about the true nature of her apparent idyll... So, there's definitely good reason for that PG certificate, though children who can cope with the story of Hansel and Gretel shouldn't find anything too disturbing here. Selick's film won great critical acclaim, and scooped festival prizes around the world, as well as picking up an Oscar nomination and winning the 2009 BAFTA Children's Award. Also featuring the voices of Keith David, Robert Bailey Jr and Ian McShane(n)</desc>

High atop Mt. Crumpet, the Grinch (Carrey) observes the residents of Whoville joyously preparing to celebrate Christmas. The Grinch was born in Whoville years ago, but was shunned due to his scary appearance, and his unrequited love for Martha May Whovier has turned him bitter; the good cheer of the Whos has been a thorn in his side ever since. Finally the Grinch decides he's had enough of all this happiness, and with the wary aid of his dog Max, the Grinch conspires to steal Christmas from Whoville, making off with their presents, holiday decorations, Christmas trees, and everything else used to enjoy the holiday. Molly Shannon, Christine Baranski, Jeffrey Tambor, and Clint Howard play several of the citizens of Whoville, while Anthony Hopkins narrates (taking over from the late Boris Karloff, who memorably read Dr. Seuss' story in Chuck Jones' 1966 animated adaptation of the story).

    <title lang="en">The Babe</title>
    <desc lang="en">John Goodman is cast as the Sultan of Swat, whose excesses -- especially drinking -- and private demons can (in this context) be excused in view of his genuine love of baseball. The facts never get in the way of a good story for screenwriter John Fusco; we're even offered the umpteenth rehash of "Little Johnny", the largely fanciful tale of the invalid boy who promises to get well if Babe hits him a homer (as in Pride of the Yankees, the cured Johnny makes return a appearance as grownup). The most amusing fabrication is the casting of narrow James Cromwell as the Babe's orphanage mentor Brother Mathias, who in real life weighed 300 pounds. Many of the characters are composites, notably Bruce Boxleitner's Jumpin' Joe Dugan. At least Ruth's two wives--Trini Alvarado as Helen, who suffers Babe's many peccadilloes and dies under strange circumstances, and Kelly McGillis as Claire, who keeps Babe on a very short leash-are depicted with a modicum of accuracy. The baseball sequences are well handled (though there could have been less slo-mo) while Elmer Bernstein's charmingly old-fashioned musical score is right in tune with the film's approach to its subject. The Babe is rated PG; had this been the whole truth and nothing but, and R rating would probably have been in order(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">For the 2012 BBC charity appeal, Nick Knowles and the team come to the aid of a centre in Edinburgh for children with additional needs. The Yard is an indoor and outdoor centre that helps 1,500 youngsters and their families each week, providing a space where families can gain much-needed respite while their children make friends, develop their confidence and learn life skills. However the building is in urgent need of a complete overhaul, so the SOS builders are joined by local tradespeople giving their time for nothing to help this worthy cause.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The broadcaster explores the Galapagos, a collection of volcanic islands in the Pacific known for its extraordinary wildlife. More than 150 years after Charles Darwin formulated his ground-breaking theory of evolution on the remote archipelago, Attenborough explains how life on the islands has continued to evolve in biological isolation, examining how the ever-changing volcanic landscape has given birth to species and sub-species that exist nowhere else in the world. He begins by revealing how Galapagos rose from the ocean four million years ago.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Hurt Locker</title>
    <desc lang="en">Kathryn Bigelow's multiple-Oscar-winning film is a compelling fact-based, Iraq-set bomb disposal drama, scripted by journalist Mark Boal, drawing on his experiences while embedded with a United States Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal team in 2004. The focus is on the complex characters making up Bravo Company, who disable and destroy improvised explosive devices. The days are ticking down to the end of the bomb squad's tour, but their role puts the team in harm's way around the clock. And it doesn't help that one of the team is addicted to risk taking and pays scant attention to standard procedure, putting other lives in danger, as well as his own. The Hurt Locker provides a tense glimpse into the lives of these extraordinary men, and also probes the various psychologies of people whose job could kill them at any moment, as well as - briefly - exploring how they cope once away from their adrenaline-soaked vocation. Also starring Anthony Mackie, Ralph Fiennes, Guy Pearce, Brian Geraghty and Evangeline Lilly(n)</desc>

It's Halloween night, and four friends -- Allison (Vanessa Horneff), Elliott (Wil Horneff), Trevor (Karl Jacob), and Brian (Sean Reid) -- are on a road trip en route to a friend's wedding when their car breaks down after running into something. Looking for help, the four happen upon the farmhouse of an elderly couple, Elvin (Richard Little) and May (Barbara Wilhide), which is located next to a huge barn. Elvin and May have already become lost in the darkness of the barn, and soon two of the lost travelers are suffering the same fate as they search for friendly strangers. However, while they can barely see a hand in front of their face, they discover they're not alone in the barn, which has become home to a huge swarm of bloodthirsty bats. The Roost is framed by an introduction and postscript from a television horror show host, played by Tom Noonan(n)</desc>

According to Chinese legend, the dead return to Earth on the seventh month of the lunar year, when the moon glows full in the night sky.

Once a year, the lunar creatures return to Earth in search of a sacrifice.

    <title lang="en">Shadow Zone: The Undead Express</title>
    <desc lang="en">A horror semi-parody targeted at the young adult market that ravenously gobbles up horror books like R.L. Stine's Goosebumps series, this made-for-TV vampire tale stars Chauncey Leopardi as Zach, a teenage rebel with a flair for telling ghost stories, who stumbles on an underground cabal of vampires when he takes a fateful ride on a New York subway. The vampire's leader, Valentine (Ron Silver), proposes a deal to young Zach, offering him safe passage to the world above, thus enabling the trapped vampire -- who can only mingle with humanity through the willing assistance of an innocent youth -- to reach the surface as well. Our young hero balks at this idea and escapes to the surface with a wild story for his skeptical pals, who shun him until one of their number is kidnapped by the undead subway dwellers in exchange for Zach's cooperation. Though atmospherically photographed, this low-budget production is a bit too corny to provide either laughs or chills, and it suffers further from lethargic pacing(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The first teen to come out of the closet at North Gateway High struggles to balance his newfound popularity with his longtime friendships as the three most popular girls in school all attempt to claim him as their G.B.F. (gay best friend). The moment Tanner (Michael J. Willett) reveals his true sexuality to his classmates he rockets up the social ladder.

Now Tanner will be faced with the most difficult decision of his high school career -- keep riding the popularity train and accept his role as a human fashion accessory, or go back to the people who have always accepted him for who he really is. Megan Mullally, Jonathan Silverman, Rebecca Gayheart, and Natasha Lyonne co-star in a comedy from director Darren Stein(n)</desc>

Henry Burke (Matt Bush) is the kind of teenager every parent dreams about having; he never ditches school, gets straight A's, and he's secured a college scholarship to pay for his higher education. Unfortunately there's just one thing standing in between Henry and his bright future -- his high-school principal. An uptight authoritarian with a hard-line anti-marijuana stance, Principal Gordon (Michael Chiklis) announces that the entire senior class will undergo mandatory drug testing, and anyone who refuses will be immediately expelled. Henry has just danced with Mary Jane for the very first time, and now his entire future is on the line thanks to a few innocent tokes. But Henry is a bright kid, and when he and local pothead Travix Breaux (Sean Marquette) put their heads together, they come up with a brilliant plan to subvert the testing policy: if they can just get every student in school stoned, Principal Gordon's plan to crucify his pot-loving charges will go completely up in smoke(n)</desc>

Though she had no concept of how far they would go, Freda had faith in The Beatles from the beginning, and The Beatles had faith in her. History notes that The Beatles were together for 10 years, but Freda worked for them for 11. Many people came in and out of the band's circle as they grew to international stardom, but Freda remained a staple because of her unfaltering loyalty and dedication. As the Beatles' devoted secretary and friend, Freda was there as history unfolded; she witnessed the evolution - advances and setbacks, breakthroughs and challenges - of one of the greatest bands in history. In Good Ol' Freda, Freda tells her story for the first time in 50 years. One of few documentaries with the support of the living Beatles and featuring original Beatles music, the film offers an insider perspective on the beloved band that changed the world of music(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Conan O'Brien Can't Stop</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Rodman Flender offers a candid look at one of the most difficult chapters in Conan O'Brien's turbulent career while following the popular late-night talk-show host on his 32-city "Legally Prohibited From Being Funny on Television Tour." In 2009, O'Brien took over The Tonight Show from host Jay Leno; seven short months later, he was looking for a new job. Though his split from NBC was undoubtedly painful, O'Brien did his best to keep his spirits high and his fans laughing, even going so far as to embark on a cross-country comedy tour after being prohibited from appearing on television. In this film, we see not only the public image put forward by a beloved yet embattled television personality, but also the fierce determination of an entertainer to persevere after watching his dreams go up in flames(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Paper Heart</title>
    <desc lang="en">Real-life sweethearts Michael Cera and Charlyne Yi star in a fictionalized version of their romance in this indie semi-documentary comedy, written by Yi. Playing themselves, Yi and Cera embark on a scripted version of their own story. In the movie, Yi has agreed to be the subject of a documentary about her quest to discover if love really exists, since she's never experienced it. As part of her participation in the project, she has a film crew follow her around throughout every new development in her love life -- which gets complicated when she starts dating fellow comedian Cera. This portion of the film is all narrative, and was written into the script, but also as part of the documentary, Yi travels the country interviewing various people about their opinions and experiences with love, and these portions of the film are real -- the interviewees are not actors. Melding truth and fantasy, Paper Heart uses equal parts comedy and realism to resolve the ultimate question of whether love is fact or fiction(n)</desc>
