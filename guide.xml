    <title lang="en">Remember the Titans</title>
    <desc lang="en">A high school football coach finds himself fighting for stakes much higher than the State Championship in this drama based on actual events. In 1971, a court order forces three high schools in Alexandria, Virginia (two white, one African-American), to integrate their student bodies and faculties for the first time. As a result, Coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton), longtime head coach of the T.C. Williams High School football team, is asked to step down, and Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) is appointed to replace him as the school's first black faculty member. The new coach is hardly welcomed with open arms, either by the school's staff or the students, and the newly integrated team is full of players (both black and white) who have little trust or respect for one another. But Boone is determined to put a winning team on the field -- it's how he approaches the game, and his future depends on it. Against long odds, Boone helps his team overcome distrust and misunderstanding of their coach (and each other) as they become a gridiron force to be reckoned with. Remember the Titans also features Nicole Ari Parker, Kate Bosworth, and Jerry Brandt, and was produced by action-film kingpin Jerry Bruckheimer(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">An authority on rare books is drawn into a confrontation with the forces of darkness in this thriller directed by Roman Polanski. Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) is a rare book broker who makes his living tracking down valuable items for rich bibliophiles. Corso is hired by Boris Balkan (Frank Langella), a millionaire New Yorker with a vast collection of occult literature and a keen interest in "The Nine Gates to the Kingdom of Shadows." Legend has it that the book was co-written by Satan in the 17th century, and only three copies are known to exist; the owner of one recently sold the book to Balkan a few days before killing himself. Balkan wants Corso to find the other two copies (one owned by a Mr. Fargas in Portugal and the other by a French collector named Kessler) and examine them to determine if they are forgeries. Corso is told to be thorough and spare no expense. He begins by visiting Liana Telfer (Lena Olin), the widow of the man who once owned Balkan's copy of the book, who has an unusually strong desire to get the book back, and confers with his friend Bernie (James Russo), who soon turns up dead, in a manner much like an illustration from the book. Corso learns that the book contains clues to a puzzle that will allow people to call up the devil, and certain people will stop at nothing to find the missing parts of the formula(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">A Beautiful Mind</title>
    <desc lang="en">The true story of prominent mathematician John Forbes Nash Jr. is the subject of this biographical drama from director Ron Howard. Russell Crowe stars as the brilliant but arrogant and conceited professor Nash. The prof seems guaranteed a rosy future in the early '50s after he marries beautiful student Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) and makes a remarkable advancement in the foundations of "game theory," which carries him to the brink of international acclaim. Soon after, John is visited by Agent William Parcher (Ed Harris), from the CIA, who wants to recruit him for code-breaking activities. But evidence suggests that Nash's perceptions of reality are cloudy at best; he is struggling to maintain his tenuous hold on sanity, and Alicia suspects a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. Battling decades of illness with the loyal Alicia by his side, Nash is ultimately able to gain some control over his mental state, and eventually goes on to triumphantly win the Nobel Prize. Based loosely on the book of the same name by Sylvia Nasar, A Beautiful Mind (2001) co-stars Paul Bettany, Adam Goldberg, Anthony Rapp, Christopher Plummer, and Judd Hirsch(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">H.G. Bissinger's best-selling true-life account of a few months in the life of a high-school football team comes to the screen in this adaptation written and directed by Peter Berg. Odessa, TX, is an oil town in the western part of the state that's home to the Permian High School Panthers, the football team with the best winning record in the state. Odessa is a town with more than its share of problems; the decline of the oil business in Texas has set the city's economy into a tailspin, and racial tensions still erupt into violence on occasion. But football is the one thing that brings all the people of Odessa together, and on Friday nights every fall, as many as 20,000 people fill Permian's football stadium to watch Coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton) and his boys try to lead the team to victory. As Gaines works to build a winning team in a town where victory is prized above all else, however, his players struggle through the emotional trials common to any teenager and ponder the fact that there is little future in their hometown...and that a championship season can be as much a burden as a triumph. Friday Night Lights also stars Lucas Black, Derek Luke, Jay Hernandez, and country singer-turned-actor Tim McGraw(n)</desc>

Cronauer's immediate superior Lt. Hauk (Bruno Kirby), whose own notions of humor are puerile and pathetic, jealously attempts to dethrone Vietnam's favorite rock jock. Fortunately, Cronauer's popularity is such that he enjoys the full protection of the higher-ups.

    <title lang="en">The Cotton Club</title>
    <desc lang="en">There are those who insist that the backstage intrigues which occurred during the production of Cotton Club would make a better film than Cotton Club itself. Essentially, this "dream" project of director Francis Ford Coppola was intended to reflect the passing parade of New York in the 1930s, using Harlem's famed Cotton Club nitery as a metaphor of the era. After innumerable in-progress script changes were made and countless post-production "improvements" were imposed, what emerged was a crazy quilt of varying styles, divergent acting techniques and stop-and-start plotlines. Occasionally, Cotton Club is well up to the standards established by Coppola in his earlier, more successful films. The central character, loosely based on George Raft and played by Richard Gere, is a jazz cornet player at the Cotton Club. Gere saves the life of gangster Dutch Schultz (James Remar), who in gratitude takes Gere under his wing, engaging the young man's services as escort for Schultz's girl friend Diane Lane (guess where this leads?) Meanwhile, Gere's overambitious hoodlum brother Nicolas Cage (playing a character inspired by mobster Mad Dog Coll) kills two innocent children during a mob hit and is forced to go into hiding. Cage holds gangster Frenchy Demarge (Fred Gwynne) as a hostage, but Demarge's safety is negotiated by Owney Madden (Bob Hoskins), the mob owner of the Cotton Club (the touching friendship between Demarge and Madden is one of the few subplots to remain intact in the film's release version). Cage is killed, followed in death shortly afterward by Schultz, who is put "on the spot" by Lucky Luciano (Joe Dallesandro). Gere wins a Hollywood movie contract and heads off to Tinseltown with Diane Lane. These plot convolutions tend to diminish the importance of the black characters who work as Cotton Club entertainers. The intriguing fact that blacks were permitted to perform at the club but were denied access as patrons should have been given as much emphasis as Richard Gere's story; instead, we are left with tantalizingly brief snatches of a romance between Gregory Hines and Lonette McKee, and a few scattered musical numbers involving Hines, his brother Maurice, Charles "Honi" Coles, and a staggeringly good Cab Calloway imitator (Larry T. Marshall). Cotton Club tends to leave the viewer feeling as though several vital ingredients are missing from the recipe, but there is still a lot left over to please the ear and eye(n)</desc>

As summer encroaches, 16-year-old Manhattanite Finn Earl (Anton Yelchin) would love nothing more than to trek off to South America and spend the year's sun-drenched months near the equator, embarking on thrilling adventures with his estranged archaeologist father, whom he's never met. Alas, the bonds of family rein in tight when Finn's booze- and coke-addled mother, the masseuse Liz (Diane Lane), cries out for help -- and, in the process, unwittingly gets Finn arrested. In a dramatic attempt to reverse circumstances and sort out the complications in both of their lives, Liz insists on taking custody of Finn for the summer. Both, she insists, will live in the home of one of her former massage clients, the aging billionaire Ogden C. Osborne (Donald Sutherland) -- with whom she may be amorously involved. Though Finn agrees begrudgingly at first, in time he finds the environment welcoming -- as he develops a crush on Ogden's gorgeous granddaughter (Kristen Stewart) and befriends Ogden's grandson. But when an unforeseen and shocking act of violence erupts, it estranges Finn and Liz from their posh surroundings and provides a sobering, harrowing reminder of the socioeconomic differences between the Earls and their new friends(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">National Lampoon's Animal House</title>
    <desc lang="en">John Landis directed this rollicking early '60s nostalgia piece reportedly based on screenwriter Chris Miller's real-life experiences as a freshman at prestigious Dartmouth College. Unable to gain acceptance at the snootier fraternities they pledge, Frosh losers Thomas Hulce and Stephen Furst find a home among the Deltas, a motley crew of misfits and sociopaths bent on disrupting the well-starched status quo. Led by seniors (Tim Matheson) and (Peter Riegert), the Delta boys engage in various illegalities that land them in hot water with both the stern college dean (John Vernon) and the neighboring jock fraternity. Their exploits eventually cause them to be placed on "double-secret probation;" finally, they are kicked out of school and, as the dean reminds them, newly eligible for the Vietnam draft. What follows is an anarchic subversion of the annual town parade -- not to mention some genuine hilarity -- as the Deltas raid the festivities for revenge, causing all hell to break loose. While parts of Animal House are uneven, some scenes are side-splittingly funny, particularly the scene in which malcontent literature professor Donald Sutherland smokes pot with his students and discusses some heavy metaphysics. However, the real reason to watch the film is John Belushi as Bluto Blutarsky, the seventh-year senior with a poor memory for world history and a penchant for drinking fifths of Jack Daniels in one draught -- he is spectacular. His memorable performance solidifies his place as one of American cinema's most outrageous comedic performers, in spite of the brevity of his career. In all, Animal House is a highly amusing comedy, sure to bring back memories for anyone who's been to college (even if they never did manage to graduate)(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A high school football coach finds himself fighting for stakes much higher than the State Championship in this drama based on actual events. In 1971, a court order forces three high schools in Alexandria, Virginia (two white, one African-American), to integrate their student bodies and faculties for the first time. As a result, Coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton), longtime head coach of the T.C. Williams High School football team, is asked to step down, and Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) is appointed to replace him as the school's first black faculty member. The new coach is hardly welcomed with open arms, either by the school's staff or the students, and the newly integrated team is full of players (both black and white) who have little trust or respect for one another. But Boone is determined to put a winning team on the field -- it's how he approaches the game, and his future depends on it. Against long odds, Boone helps his team overcome distrust and misunderstanding of their coach (and each other) as they become a gridiron force to be reckoned with. Remember the Titans also features Nicole Ari Parker, Kate Bosworth, and Jerry Brandt, and was produced by action-film kingpin Jerry Bruckheimer(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">(2008) Angelina Jolie, James McAvoy and Morgan Freeman star in this violent action adventure from Russian director Timur Bekmambetov (Nightwatch, Daywatch). The life of office worker Wesley Gibson (McAvoy) has been one of frustration, disappointment and anxiety; he has an overbearing boss, his girlfriend and his best friend are duplicitously having an affair, and he's on medication to calm his nerves. To top it all, he one day finds himself on the wrong end of an assassination attempt. Luckily, the agile, honed and lethal Fox (Jolie) is at hand to save his life. However, she also reveals that his recently deceased father was secretly a supremely skilled killer, and that it's her job to ensure that Wesley takes his place in the Fraternity, the mystical organisation overseen by Sloan (Freeman), which exists to rid the world of evil-doers. And so begins Wesley's journey to unlock his hitherto unsuspected innate deadly abilities and use them for good. The cinematography echoes the inventiveness of Bekmambetov's earlier movies and takes a Matrix-like delight in playing with the tempo and camera angles of the fight scenes(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Cotton Club</title>
    <desc lang="en">There are those who insist that the backstage intrigues which occurred during the production of Cotton Club would make a better film than Cotton Club itself. Essentially, this "dream" project of director Francis Ford Coppola was intended to reflect the passing parade of New York in the 1930s, using Harlem's famed Cotton Club nitery as a metaphor of the era. After innumerable in-progress script changes were made and countless post-production "improvements" were imposed, what emerged was a crazy quilt of varying styles, divergent acting techniques and stop-and-start plotlines. Occasionally, Cotton Club is well up to the standards established by Coppola in his earlier, more successful films. The central character, loosely based on George Raft and played by Richard Gere, is a jazz cornet player at the Cotton Club. Gere saves the life of gangster Dutch Schultz (James Remar), who in gratitude takes Gere under his wing, engaging the young man's services as escort for Schultz's girl friend Diane Lane (guess where this leads?) Meanwhile, Gere's overambitious hoodlum brother Nicolas Cage (playing a character inspired by mobster Mad Dog Coll) kills two innocent children during a mob hit and is forced to go into hiding. Cage holds gangster Frenchy Demarge (Fred Gwynne) as a hostage, but Demarge's safety is negotiated by Owney Madden (Bob Hoskins), the mob owner of the Cotton Club (the touching friendship between Demarge and Madden is one of the few subplots to remain intact in the film's release version). Cage is killed, followed in death shortly afterward by Schultz, who is put "on the spot" by Lucky Luciano (Joe Dallesandro). Gere wins a Hollywood movie contract and heads off to Tinseltown with Diane Lane. These plot convolutions tend to diminish the importance of the black characters who work as Cotton Club entertainers. The intriguing fact that blacks were permitted to perform at the club but were denied access as patrons should have been given as much emphasis as Richard Gere's story; instead, we are left with tantalizingly brief snatches of a romance between Gregory Hines and Lonette McKee, and a few scattered musical numbers involving Hines, his brother Maurice, Charles "Honi" Coles, and a staggeringly good Cab Calloway imitator (Larry T. Marshall). Cotton Club tends to leave the viewer feeling as though several vital ingredients are missing from the recipe, but there is still a lot left over to please the ear and eye(n)</desc>

As summer encroaches, 16-year-old Manhattanite Finn Earl (Anton Yelchin) would love nothing more than to trek off to South America and spend the year's sun-drenched months near the equator, embarking on thrilling adventures with his estranged archaeologist father, whom he's never met. Alas, the bonds of family rein in tight when Finn's booze- and coke-addled mother, the masseuse Liz (Diane Lane), cries out for help -- and, in the process, unwittingly gets Finn arrested. In a dramatic attempt to reverse circumstances and sort out the complications in both of their lives, Liz insists on taking custody of Finn for the summer. Both, she insists, will live in the home of one of her former massage clients, the aging billionaire Ogden C. Osborne (Donald Sutherland) -- with whom she may be amorously involved. Though Finn agrees begrudgingly at first, in time he finds the environment welcoming -- as he develops a crush on Ogden's gorgeous granddaughter (Kristen Stewart) and befriends Ogden's grandson. But when an unforeseen and shocking act of violence erupts, it estranges Finn and Liz from their posh surroundings and provides a sobering, harrowing reminder of the socioeconomic differences between the Earls and their new friends(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">National Lampoon's Animal House</title>
    <desc lang="en">John Landis directed this rollicking early '60s nostalgia piece reportedly based on screenwriter Chris Miller's real-life experiences as a freshman at prestigious Dartmouth College. Unable to gain acceptance at the snootier fraternities they pledge, Frosh losers Thomas Hulce and Stephen Furst find a home among the Deltas, a motley crew of misfits and sociopaths bent on disrupting the well-starched status quo. Led by seniors (Tim Matheson) and (Peter Riegert), the Delta boys engage in various illegalities that land them in hot water with both the stern college dean (John Vernon) and the neighboring jock fraternity. Their exploits eventually cause them to be placed on "double-secret probation;" finally, they are kicked out of school and, as the dean reminds them, newly eligible for the Vietnam draft. What follows is an anarchic subversion of the annual town parade -- not to mention some genuine hilarity -- as the Deltas raid the festivities for revenge, causing all hell to break loose. While parts of Animal House are uneven, some scenes are side-splittingly funny, particularly the scene in which malcontent literature professor Donald Sutherland smokes pot with his students and discusses some heavy metaphysics. However, the real reason to watch the film is John Belushi as Bluto Blutarsky, the seventh-year senior with a poor memory for world history and a penchant for drinking fifths of Jack Daniels in one draught -- he is spectacular. His memorable performance solidifies his place as one of American cinema's most outrageous comedic performers, in spite of the brevity of his career. In all, Animal House is a highly amusing comedy, sure to bring back memories for anyone who's been to college (even if they never did manage to graduate)(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Wanted</title>
    <desc lang="en">(2008) Angelina Jolie, James McAvoy and Morgan Freeman star in this violent action adventure from Russian director Timur Bekmambetov (Nightwatch, Daywatch). The life of office worker Wesley Gibson (McAvoy) has been one of frustration, disappointment and anxiety; he has an overbearing boss, his girlfriend and his best friend are duplicitously having an affair, and he's on medication to calm his nerves. To top it all, he one day finds himself on the wrong end of an assassination attempt. Luckily, the agile, honed and lethal Fox (Jolie) is at hand to save his life. However, she also reveals that his recently deceased father was secretly a supremely skilled killer, and that it's her job to ensure that Wesley takes his place in the Fraternity, the mystical organisation overseen by Sloan (Freeman), which exists to rid the world of evil-doers. And so begins Wesley's journey to unlock his hitherto unsuspected innate deadly abilities and use them for good. The cinematography echoes the inventiveness of Bekmambetov's earlier movies and takes a Matrix-like delight in playing with the tempo and camera angles of the fight scenes(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Dead Woman Walking: The Karla Faye Tucker Story. This documentary, part of the American Justice series from A&amp;E, examines the Texas death penalty case of Karla Faye Walker. Narrated by American Justice host and producer Bill Kurtis, this episode goes inside the investigation of the two murders that Walker and her boyfriend Daniel Ryan Garrett committed. The trial of Walker is shown through exclusive footage. After the conviction, American Justice follows her through her daily life, showing her prison surroundings and talking with her about her crimes. Sentenced to death, while Walker was waiting to be executed, she became a born-again Christian. Her lawyers used this transformation as leverage to try to get her death sentence reduced to life in prison. Their attempts were unsuccessful and Walker was killed by lethal injection in February 1998. American Justice also shows interviews with lawyers and law enforcement professionals who knew Walker(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">From enormous tortoises and deep-diving lizards to fish-eating snakes and birds that hunt giant, venomous centipedes, the wildlife of the Galapagos Islands is unique and bizarre. However, the wilderness that inspired Charles Darwin and the theory of evolution is becoming ever-more crowded due to increased migration and tourism. David Attenborough narrates this documentary, which examines how the Pacific archipelago's animals are adapting to their changing circumstances.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">13 Tzameti (2005) writer/director Géla Babluani gives his critically lauded thriller an English-language makeover in this remake featuring Mickey Rourke and Jason Statham. Handyman Vince Ferro (Sam Riley) is in a serious financial bind, and he decides to steal a mysterious envelope containing a lucrative job offer. Posing as the client he stole it from, Vince quickly finds himself participating in a bizarre game of Russian roulette in which degenerate gamblers wager on life and death. The rules are simple: Each participant loads a single bullet into a revolver, spins the chamber, and points it at another man's head. When the light bulb in the center of the room turns on, each contestant pulls the trigger. The players who survive live to play another round as the stakes get progressively higher. Should anyone attempt to escape, they're shot on sight. With a little luck, perhaps Vince can live through the game and collect a big-enough payout to solve all of his problems. Ray Winstone, Curtis "50 Cent" Jackson, Michael Shannon, and Alexander Skarsgard co-star(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Rocky III</title>
    <desc lang="en">Sylvester Stallone returns to the character which made him famous in this wildly successful sequel. Rocky III starts with the Italian Stallion so famous that his likeness is everywhere, including pinball machines. Fame and complacency soon cause Balboa to lose his title to young thug Clubber Lang (Mr. T), who inadvertently causes the death of Rocky's beloved trainer, Mickey (Burgess Meredith), before their first championship bout. After sinking into a depression, Balboa must regain the love and support of his family, as well as the elusive "eye of the tiger," the hungry need to beat the opponent which former foe Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) teaches him during this film's de rigueur training sequence. In the end, Balboa faces off against Lang for a second time. "Eye of the Tiger," the theme song Stallone commissioned from the band Survivor, became a huge hit single(n)</desc>

Rocky must get ready for one more impossible bout against a clobbering cluck who probably couldn't get his own grandma to root for him. Even though there is probably never any real doubt as to the outcome, this film will likely have viewers on their chairs' edges one more time(n)</desc>

The film opens as homicidal extraterrestrial Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement) escaping a 40-year incarceration in a secret high-security prison on the moon. Freshly liberated, Boris sets out for long-brooded-upon revenge on Agent K who shot off his arm when he was captured. Time-travelling to the late 1960s, Boris intends to avoid his amputation, wipe Agent K from history and lead Earth's invasion by his race. Thus Agent J must also head back in time to prevent his friend's younger self from meeting an untimely death and the rest of us from being conquered... With Emma Thompson as Agent O, J and K's boss, and Michael Stuhlbarg as Griffin, J's alien sidekick, who's capable of seeing every possible outcome in every situation(n)</desc>

A petits fours-making challenge provides an early test of nerves, before the quartet face the toughest technical task in the show's history - creating a fraisier, a sponge cake filled with mousse and strawberries. As tempers rise and confidence falters, the contestants have one last chance to impress judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry by baking a showstopping choux gateau - before discovering who has earned a place in the 2012 final.

    <title lang="en">127 Hours</title>
    <desc lang="en">Danny Boyle's part Film4-funded, multi Oscar- and BAFTA-nominated, fact-based drama stars James Franco as a mountain climber who gets himself into a desperate predicament. When adrenaline junkie Aaron Ralston (Franco) sets off to conquer a canyon in the stunning landscape of a Utah national park, he has no idea quite how bad a day he's in for. His trip starts out well enough, bumping into Kristi (Kate Mara) and Megan (Amber Tamblyn), a couple of foxy female hikers, but it starts its inexorable decline when he heads off to tackle Blue John Canyon - solo, with no means of communication on him and without telling anyone his plans. So, when he quickly and irreversibly gets his arm stuck under a rock, he's utterly on his own. All he's carrying is a miniscule supply of food and water and - crucially - a small multi-tool. During the 127 hours he's pinned to the canyon wall, Ralston weighs his options, mentally replays the key points of his life and loves, drifts into delirium, and, finally, summons the sheer grit and force of will needed to commit the act that could give him a slim chance of survival. And the squeamish may need to look away and plug their ears when he does so!(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Road to Perdition</title>
    <desc lang="en">The acclaimed graphic novel from crime writer Max Allan Collins becomes this big budget Dreamworks drama from director Sam Mendes and screenwriter David Self. Tom Hanks stars as Michael Sullivan, a morally conflicted Depression-era hit man committing murder in the name of his employer, John Rooney (Paul Newman). A kindly, aging Irish crime boss who raised Sullivan as his surrogate son, Rooney is affiliated with Al Capone in Chicago and thus wields great power in the "Tri-Cities" of Moline, IL; Rock Island, IL; and Davenport, IA. Curious about his father's mysterious profession, Sullivan's son, Michael Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin), stows away in his father's automobile one night and witnesses the execution of a man at the hands of Sullivan and Rooney's biological son, Connor (Daniel Craig). Although Michael keeps his promise to remain silent about what he's seen, the paranoid and unstable Connor tries to wipe out the entire Sullivan clan anyway, succeeding only in killing Sullivan's wife, Annie (Jennifer Jason Leigh), and youngest son, Peter (Liam Aiken). Enraged at this and another surprise betrayal by the Rooneys, Sullivan embarks on a path of bloody retribution, Michael in tow. Although he intends to leave his boy with relatives in the rural town of Perdition once the coast is clear, he ends up exposing Michael to the goriest aspects of his talents, slaughtering former associates as he dodges contract assassin Maguire (Jude Law) and cripples the cash flow of the Rooney and Capone organizations through a series of bank robberies, attempting to force either mob family to offer up the sequestered Connor as a sacrifice. Inspired by the popular Japanese comic book series Lone Wolf and Cub and based loosely on an episode from the life and career of notorious real-life crime figures John and Connor Looney, Road to Perdition co-stars Stanley Tucci as legendary Chicago mobster Frank Nitti(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Road to Perdition</title>
    <desc lang="en">The acclaimed graphic novel from crime writer Max Allan Collins becomes this big budget Dreamworks drama from director Sam Mendes and screenwriter David Self. Tom Hanks stars as Michael Sullivan, a morally conflicted Depression-era hit man committing murder in the name of his employer, John Rooney (Paul Newman). A kindly, aging Irish crime boss who raised Sullivan as his surrogate son, Rooney is affiliated with Al Capone in Chicago and thus wields great power in the "Tri-Cities" of Moline, IL; Rock Island, IL; and Davenport, IA. Curious about his father's mysterious profession, Sullivan's son, Michael Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin), stows away in his father's automobile one night and witnesses the execution of a man at the hands of Sullivan and Rooney's biological son, Connor (Daniel Craig). Although Michael keeps his promise to remain silent about what he's seen, the paranoid and unstable Connor tries to wipe out the entire Sullivan clan anyway, succeeding only in killing Sullivan's wife, Annie (Jennifer Jason Leigh), and youngest son, Peter (Liam Aiken). Enraged at this and another surprise betrayal by the Rooneys, Sullivan embarks on a path of bloody retribution, Michael in tow. Although he intends to leave his boy with relatives in the rural town of Perdition once the coast is clear, he ends up exposing Michael to the goriest aspects of his talents, slaughtering former associates as he dodges contract assassin Maguire (Jude Law) and cripples the cash flow of the Rooney and Capone organizations through a series of bank robberies, attempting to force either mob family to offer up the sequestered Connor as a sacrifice. Inspired by the popular Japanese comic book series Lone Wolf and Cub and based loosely on an episode from the life and career of notorious real-life crime figures John and Connor Looney, Road to Perdition co-stars Stanley Tucci as legendary Chicago mobster Frank Nitti(n)</desc>

When Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio), a multiple murderer who methodically drowns his victims and performs bizarre rituals with their bodies, falls into a coma, FBI agent Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) asks Deane to enter the killer's psyche, in the hope of finding a missing girl whom Stargher has kidnapped; if she's not soon found, in all likelihood she'll die in his torture cell. However, once Deane enters the bizarre world of Stargher's mind, she finds getting out to be a very difficult matter. The Cell was the first feature from director Tarsem, who previously made award-winning commercials and music videos, including the video for R.E.M.'s "Losing My Religion." The supporting cast includes Catherine Sutherland, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Dylan Baker, and Pruitt Taylor Vince(n)</desc>

The incident destroys Joe's confidence and he sinks into a depression that keeps him away from work.

Lo Fong (Roger Yuan), onetime captain of the Chinese Imperial Guard, has traded upholding the law for smuggling opium. Needing some operating capital, Lo Fong kidnaps the Emperor's daughter, Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu), and takes her to America. When the Emperor sends his best men to find her, Chon Wang (Chan), one of the Emperor's less distinguished guards, insists on joining them; he feels at fault for Lo Fong's capturing the Princess, and he wants to make amends. However, while the rescue party scours the West, Chon Wang gets separated from the group and soon becomes lost. When he crosses paths with Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson), a bright but arrogant train robber, the two become unlikely allies. While Shanghai Noon was billed as Jackie Chan's follow-up to Rush Hour, his first successful American-made feature, it was actually filmed in Canada, as was Chan's breakthrough film in America, the Hong Kong-backed Rumble in the Bronx(n)</desc>

When the impish Jerry Mitchell (Casey Siemaszko) is assigned to interview the new transfer student with a supposedly violent past, Buddy Revell (Richard Tyson), he makes the fatal mistake of touching his subject. Revell, who hates being touched, responds by challenging the unwilling Mitchell to a fight at three o'clock in the parking lot.

In Lost and Found, David Spade plays Dylan, who is about to open an new restaurant and has finally found the perfect apartment. The apartment just gets better when he meets his new neighbor, Lila (Sophie Marceau), a very beautiful women who has recently come to the United States from France. However, Lila has just gotten out of a bad relationship with René (Patrick Bruel), who doesn't want to leave her alone, so she has little interest in romance, preferring to devote herself to her cello and her dog Jack. One day, Jack runs away and Dylan finds him; when he returns the pooch to Lila, it's the first time she's been willing to speak in full sentences to him, though not for very long. Faster than you can say "That idea is so crazy it just might work!", Dylan decides to kidnap Jack; when Lila thinks the dog is lost, Dylan will generously volunteer to help look for him, which will give Dylan a chance to impress Lila when he's able to find Jack so quickly. Sure enough, Dylan swipes the dog, but from that point on the plan hardly goes the way he had hoped. Star David Spade also co-wrote the screenplay with J.B. Cook and Marc Meeks; the supporting cast includes Martin Sheen, Mitchell Whitfield, Artie Lang and Jon Lovitz(n)</desc>

In Lost and Found, David Spade plays Dylan, who is about to open an new restaurant and has finally found the perfect apartment. The apartment just gets better when he meets his new neighbor, Lila (Sophie Marceau), a very beautiful women who has recently come to the United States from France. However, Lila has just gotten out of a bad relationship with René (Patrick Bruel), who doesn't want to leave her alone, so she has little interest in romance, preferring to devote herself to her cello and her dog Jack. One day, Jack runs away and Dylan finds him; when he returns the pooch to Lila, it's the first time she's been willing to speak in full sentences to him, though not for very long. Faster than you can say "That idea is so crazy it just might work!", Dylan decides to kidnap Jack; when Lila thinks the dog is lost, Dylan will generously volunteer to help look for him, which will give Dylan a chance to impress Lila when he's able to find Jack so quickly. Sure enough, Dylan swipes the dog, but from that point on the plan hardly goes the way he had hoped. Star David Spade also co-wrote the screenplay with J.B. Cook and Marc Meeks; the supporting cast includes Martin Sheen, Mitchell Whitfield, Artie Lang and Jon Lovitz(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Good Guy</title>
    <desc lang="en">After executive producing the acclaimed documentary Manda Bala and the J.M. Coetzee adaptation Disgrace, Julio DePietro makes his feature debut as a writer-director with The Good Guy, a drama about ambitious young Wall Streeters fighting each other -- and sometimes their own decent nature -- to get ahead in the world. Our narrator, Tommy (Scott Porter of TV's Friday Night Lights), is young, clever, charming, and attractive. He's got a smart, pretty girlfriend, Beth (Alexis Bledel of Gilmore Girls), an urban conservationist. He's also very good at his investment broker job, impressing his ruthless, cynical boss, Cash (erstwhile "Brat Pack" member Andrew McCarthy). When a key member of Tommy's sales team suddenly leaves for a competitor, Tommy needs to fill his spot quickly, and takes a chance on the bumbling Daniel (Bryan Greenberg, Bride Wars), a former Marine and computer geek who seems a bit naïve about high finance and a bit nervous around women. Tommy takes Daniel under his wing, showing him how to dress, where to socialize, and how to charm attractive women. Their relationship is threatened when Daniel begins spending more time with Beth, joining her book club, and becoming her confidant. Tommy begins to question his decision to share his wisdom with Daniel, while Daniel is forced to decide what success really means to him, and where his loyalties lie. The Good Guy also stars Anna Chlumsky (In the Loop) and Aaron Yoo (Disturbia). The film had its world premiere at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival(n)</desc>

Upon returning home, Vince meets Jared and his mother Dana (Lori Loughlin), and soon finds himself falling for the newly-single mother. Before long, the trio has formed a family. Their momentary bliss is soon shattered, however, when Vince discovers he's about to be redeployed, and realizes his role as a father figure will soon take a backseat to his role as a soldier(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Last Cowboy</title>
    <desc lang="en">The title character in this made-for-cable contemporary Western could be hard-bitten cattle rancher John William Cooper (Lance Henriksen), or, for that matter, John's long-estranged daughter Jacqueline "Jake" Cooper (Jennie Garth). Having broken off relations with her dad due to an unpleasant incident involving her mother, Jake returns to Dry Creek Ranch after an eight-year absence with her young son, Billy (Dylan Wagner), in tow. The reasons have little to do with father-daughter love; John's father has died, and the ranch is now mortgaged to the hilt. Out of a sense of obligation, Jake agrees to work the ranch in hopes of putting it back on its financial feet, all the while keeping her distance from the taciturn John. Other interested parties include cowboy Morgan Murphy (Bradley Cooper), who wants to help Jake despite her father's resistance to Morgan's "newfangled" ranching methods, and John's old pal Amos (M.C. Gainey), who is determined to mend the fences between John and Jake. The Last Cowboy was first broadcast by the Hallmark Channel on January 17, 2003(n)</desc>

The year is 2017, and a vampire plague has turned most of the planet's human population into bloodsucking ghouls. As the population of mortals fast begins to dwindle, a vampiric corporation sets out to capture and farm every remaining human while simultaneously researching a consumable blood substitute, headed by undead hematologist Edward Dalton (Ethan Hawke). His work is interrupted after stumbling onto a pocket of human survivors lead by Elvis (Willem Dafoe), a former vampire, whose past reveals a cure that could reverse the tide and save the human race. With time running out, Dalton's only hope lies in outsmarting the security forces of his boss (Sam Neill), whose goal isn't just to find a substitute, but to repopulate humanity in order to sell its blood to the highest bidder(n)</desc>

The archaeologists battle inclement weather to begin a dig on the mainland, where team leader Francis Pryor sees characteristics suggestive of a classic Iron Age fort beginning to emerge.(n)</desc>

In this one hour programme physicists such as Stephen Hawking and Michio Kaku talk about the possibility of time travel. They both agree that time travel to the future is possible. Traveling close to the speed of light will slow down the rate of time experienced. But other physicists are trying to find ways to travel back in time. To do this they attempt to warp space and time by using gravity. Time travel into the past does however raise some difficult issues. Could the time traveler alter history?(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Hills Have Eyes</title>
    <desc lang="en">Horror auteur Wes Craven followed his threadbare but horrifically compelling cult classic Last House on the Left with this wonderfully demented morality fable about a bloody war of attrition between two extremely different families. The story opens on the journey of the Carters, a mildly dysfunctional extended family led by patriarch "Big Bob" Carter (Russ Grieve), as they travel across the California desert in search of an inherited silver mine. When a broken axle leaves them stranded in the middle of a former nuclear testing site, their attempts to find help lead them unwittingly into the territory of a savage family of cave-dwelling cannibals, the apparent progeny of the bearlike Jupiter (James Whitworth) and an abducted prostitute. Jupiter's eldest son Pluto (professional movie weirdo Michael Berryman) leads the first brutal attack on the defenseless Carters who, through necessity, are driven to equally extreme measures in order to survive. Though the film is not overtly bloody, the scenes depicting this confrontation are rendered with an unflinching directness, and the violations visited on the Carters are so brutal as to make the survivors' regression into savagery all the more convincing. No one is spared from the nightmare: Jupiter's boys have even kidnapped the youngest member of the Carter family -- a mere infant -- to serve as fodder for their next barbecue, and the baby becomes the main point of contention between the rival clans. Craven nevertheless refuses to take the easy way out by depicting his "monsters" as soullessly evil; parallels between either family's "values" are clearly drawn as the differences between the two clans begin to blur(n)</desc>

Fifteen years ago, an elusive serial killer known as The Wolf claimed the lives of 15 young girls. Thanks to the work of Detectives Elliott Carbon (John Rhys-Davies) and Johnny Morgan ( Andrew Cymek), The Wolf was eventually captured, locked up, and placed in the care of Dr. Parker (William B. Davis). When the facility loses power and the lights go dark, however, The Wolf and the rest of the inmates seize the opportunity to reclaim their freedom. Now trapped in these winding corridors with a rampaging gang of maniacs, madmen, and murderers, Johnny and Dr. Parker must fight to survive the night, and ensure that no one escapes before order is restored(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Beyond the Sea</title>
    <desc lang="en">Kevin Spacey serves as both director and star for this biopic based on the life and career of legendary entertainer Bobby Darin, which moves back and forth between his childhood and adult selves to tell the tale of his remarkable life. Born Bobby Cassotto and raised in the Bronx, young Bobby (played as a child by William Ullrich) was raised by his mother, Polly (Brenda Blethyn), his brother-in-law, Charlie (Bob Hoskins), and his sister, Nina (Caroline Aaron). At the age of 15, Bobby contracted a severe case of rheumatic fever, which was expected to take his life; while it left him with a weak heart, Bobby beat the odds and survived. Buoyed by a love of music passed along by his mother, Bobby learned to play several instruments and began singing as he recovered. Displaying a confidence and drive which stopped just short of arrogance, he adopted the stage name Bobby Darin and set his sights on becoming a star. After a string of hits as a rock &amp; roll singer, Darin (played as an adult by Kevin Spacey) takes another gamble, and with the help of manager Steve Blauner (John Goodman) he reinvents himself as a supper-club vocalist in the manner of Frank Sinatra. All the more remarkably, he succeeds, and his swinging version of "Mack the Knife" tops the charts. Now a major singing star, Darin decides to take up acting; on the set of his first movie, he woos his female co-star Sandra Dee (Kate Bosworth), and despite the stern objections of her mother (Greta Scacchi), Bobby and Sandra wed. But after a string of successful movies for Dee and hit records and an Oscar nomination for Darin, the shifting tastes of the 1960s throw their careers off-track. Bobby cautiously embraces the new sounds of the day, but his old fans don't want to hear him cover Bob Dylan or the Rolling Stones, while the younger audience isn't interested in his new sound, leaving Darin in a difficult place to make his way back to stardom. Kevin Spacey did his own singing for Beyond the Sea, recreating Bobby Darin's vocal style with uncanny accuracy(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Legend of the Fist: The Return of Chen Zhen</title>
    <desc lang="en">A celebrated Chinese hero returns to the mainland seven years after the fight that made him a myth, and assumes the identity of a masked crusader in order to expose the clandestine alliance between the Japanese and the mafia, and to procure a vital assassination list in this epic action thriller from Infernal Affairs director Andy Lau. At the height of the Warlord Era, China is being torn apart though internal conflict, allowing Japanese forces to gain a foothold in Northern Shanghai. His mentor murdered by Japanese troops, Chinese avenger Chen Zhen (Donnie Yen) single-handedly defeats an entire dojo full of enemy combatants amidst a blinding shower of bullets. Though his body is never recovered, Chen Zhen is presumed to have perished in the fight. Flash forward seven years, when high-ranking Japanese officials rub elbows with ruthless gangsters in the lavish Casablanca nightclub as the impoverished masses starve in the streets. Suddenly, into the Shanghai social scene steps a wealthy entrepreneur named "Ku" (also Yen), whose obvious affluence quickly gains him an audience with the most powerful mob boss in town. Little do the local criminal masterminds realize it's all an elaborate ruse; by day Ku uses his relationship with the formidable gangster to gather intelligence on the collusion between the Chinese underworld and the Japanese military, and by night he dons a mask in order to fight the powers attempting to oppress his people. But the closer Ku grows to scorching beauty Kiki (Shu Qi), the more he risks blowing his cover. Later, when Ku discovers evidence of a top-secret Japanese hit list that threatens to shift the balance of power in their favor, he prepares to risk his life in a fight that could alter the future of an entire nation, and give the downtrodden masses hope for a better future(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Dressed to Kill</title>
    <desc lang="en">In this stylish, violent thriller,an unhappy wife, Kate Miller (Angie Dickinson), meets a handsome man in a museum and goes to his apartment for a quick sexual encounter. As she leaves, she is brutally murdered. Kate's son, Peter (Keith Gordon) sets out to solve the murder aided by the call-girl Liz (Nancy Allen), who discovered his mother's body and got a glimpse of the murderer, a blond woman. Peter begins watching the office of Kate's psychiatrist, Dr. Elliott (Michael Caine), setting up a camera to record the comings and goings of his patients. When the suspect finally appears, Liz makes an appointment with Elliott in order to get a look at his appointment book. In Dressed to Kill director Brian De Palma deftly incorporates all the tricks and plot devices he learned from observing the masters of the genre, Alfred Hitchcock, Mario Bava and Dario Argento to great effect. The scene where Kate meets her lover in the museum is reminiscent of Vertigo. The murder of Kate in the elevator frightening, bloody and chillingly effective, is similar in tone to the shower scene in Hitchcock'sPsycho. Brian De Palma directs with great visual panache, and gets great performances from his cast, particularly Michael Caine who gives his usual fine performance in a surprising and difficult role. Dressed to Kill is a violent, gory, memorable thriller with many surprises and exciting plot twists(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Broken Arrow</title>
    <desc lang="en">John Woo brought all his Hong Kong martial arts movie knowledge to this film and it positively jumps off the screen. The plot is fairly thin; John Travolta plays air force pilot Major Vic 'Deak' Deakins, Christian Slater his number two Captain Riley Hale. Deakins, a traitor, crashes their Stealth bomber, steals the nuclear warheads and sets off to meet his terrorist masters. Hale follows in pursuit, helped by glamorous park ranger Terry Carmichael and, of course, assumed by the authorities to be in on the plot. Cue car chases, fights on moving (and burning) trains, gunfights galore and the constant threat of the weapons being exploded en route. Surrendering to the sheer breakneck action of the film makes it one of the better Hollywood blockbusters of its time and Travolta's rehabilitation as an actor wasn't hurt by his amoral villain(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Bridge to Terabithia</title>
    <desc lang="en">From the producers of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe and the mind of author Katherine Paterson comes a rousing fantasy adventure about family, friendship, and the wondrous power of imagination. A perpetual outsider both at home and at school, Jess Aarons (Josh Hutcherson) just never seems to fit in no matter how hard he tries. When his goal to become the fastest runner in middle school is unexpectedly thwarted by newly arrived classmate Leslie Burke (AnnaSophia Robb), who enters in an "all boys" race and leaves her competitors in the dust, Jess soon strikes up a friendship with the imaginative outsider.

    <desc lang="en">Mexican filmmaker Alejandro González Iñárritu makes his first English-language feature with the downbeat drama 21 Grams. Set in an unnamed U.S. urban center, the film uses a nonlinear structure to piece together the intertwined lives of three very different people. Paul (Sean Penn) is a math teacher with a heart problem and a troubled marriage to British wife Mary (Charlotte Gainsbourg). Christine (Naomi Watts) is a former drug addict who lives with her husband, Michael (Danny Huston), and her daughters. Jack (Benicio del Toro) is a born-again Christian with a wife (Melissa Leo) who has stood by him since his days as a criminal. Following a tragic accident, the three main characters are thrown into each other's lives. 21 Grams was shown in competition at the 2003 Venice International Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Perfect Holiday</title>
    <desc lang="en">Gabrielle Union, Morris Chestnut, Queen Latifah, and Terrence Howard star in a film concerning a young girl who implores a department-store Santa to find a new husband for her divorced mother for Christmas. Single mother of three Nancy (Union) has been putting the needs of her three children ahead of her own for as far back as she can remember, and lately her youngest daughter, Emily (Khail Bryant), has become acutely aware of her mother's palpable sadness. As Christmas draws near, Nancy takes her kids to the mall for a cheerful visit with jolly old Saint Nick. When it comes time for Emily's turn to sit on Santa's lap and make her Christmas wish, she selflessly remembers her mother's recent comment that a compliment from a man would be the best gift of all. Determined to make her mother happy again even if it means sacrificing her own wish, Emily relays the message to Santa (Chestnut), not realizing that the man beneath the beard is actually an office-supply salesman and ambitious singer/songwriter named Benjamin. Recognizing the daughter's love for her mother and sensing something truly special in Nancy, Benjamin cheerfully obliges the young girl, setting into motion a series of events that promise to make this the most memorable holiday in quite some time. Lance Rivera directs a film produced by Shakim Compere and Latifah through Flavor Unit Entertainment(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A man who's uncertain about the biggest step forward of his life steps back to take a look at his younger days in this comedy/drama. Roland (Taye Diggs) is a few hours away from getting married, and he is starting to have second thoughts; as much as he loves his fiancée, he can't stop thinking about Tanya (Tamala Jones), his first serious girlfriend in high school. Roland is hanging out with his two best friends, whom he also first met in school, Mike (Omar Epps), a solid regular guy, and Slim (Richard T. Jones), a flashy personality who plays pro basketball in Europe. They talk about the old days and flash back on growing up in Inglewood, California (nicknamed "The Wood") in the 1980's, when Run DMC and Eric B &amp; Rakim were the happening sounds, and guys used to argue over who was hotter, Vanity or Apollonia. At the last minute, Roland takes off, wanting to pay Tanya a visit, and Mike and Slim are determined to track him down and make sure that he gets to the altar on time. The Wood was the debut feature film for writer/director Rick Famuyiwa, whose first short subject, Blacktop Lingo, won an enthusiastic response at the 1996 Sundance Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A starry-eyed would-be star discovers just how far the notion that "there's no such thing as bad publicity" can go in this screen adaptation of the hit Broadway musical +Chicago, originally directed and choreographed by Bob Fosse. In the mid-'20s, Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) is a small-time chorus dancer married to a well-meaning dunderhead named Amos (John C. Reilly). Roxie is having an affair on the side with Fred Casley (Dominic West), a smooth talker who insists he can make her a star. However, Fred strings Roxie along a bit too far for his own good, and when she realizes that his promises are empty, she becomes enraged and murders Fred in cold blood. Roxie soon finds herself behind bars alongside Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a sexy vaudeville star who used to perform with her sister until Velma discovered that her sister had been sleeping with her husband. Velma shot them both dead, and, after scheming prison matron "Mama" Morton hooks Velma up with hotshot lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), Velma becomes the new Queen of the scandal sheets. Roxie is just shrewd enough to realize that her poor fortune could also bring her fame, so she convinces Amos to also hire Flynn. Soon Flynn is splashing Roxie's story -- or, more accurately, a highly melodramatic revision of Roxie's story -- all over the gutter press, and Roxy and Velma are soon battling neck-to-neck over who can win greater fame through the headlines. A project that had been moving from studio to studio since the musical opened on Broadway in 1973, Chicago also features guest appearances by Lucy Liu and Christine Baranski(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A man who's uncertain about the biggest step forward of his life steps back to take a look at his younger days in this comedy/drama. Roland (Taye Diggs) is a few hours away from getting married, and he is starting to have second thoughts; as much as he loves his fiancée, he can't stop thinking about Tanya (Tamala Jones), his first serious girlfriend in high school. Roland is hanging out with his two best friends, whom he also first met in school, Mike (Omar Epps), a solid regular guy, and Slim (Richard T. Jones), a flashy personality who plays pro basketball in Europe. They talk about the old days and flash back on growing up in Inglewood, California (nicknamed "The Wood") in the 1980's, when Run DMC and Eric B &amp; Rakim were the happening sounds, and guys used to argue over who was hotter, Vanity or Apollonia. At the last minute, Roland takes off, wanting to pay Tanya a visit, and Mike and Slim are determined to track him down and make sure that he gets to the altar on time. The Wood was the debut feature film for writer/director Rick Famuyiwa, whose first short subject, Blacktop Lingo, won an enthusiastic response at the 1996 Sundance Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">What Dreams May Come</title>
    <desc lang="en">Based on a metaphysical 1978 novel by science fiction and horror author Richard Matheson, this romantic fantasy-drama won an Oscar for its expensive and impressive visual vistas depicting an imaginative afterlife. Robin Williams stars as Chris Nielsen, a doctor who has suffered with his artist wife Annie (Annabella Sciorra) through the devastating loss of their children, Marie and Ian, who were killed in a car accident. Although Annie's all-consuming depression nearly destroyed their marriage, the couple rebuilt their relationship and are now living out a comfortable middle age. Stopping one night to help a motorist in a wreck, Chris is struck by a car and killed. At first confused about where he is, Chris meets Albert (Cuba Gooding Jr.), a spiritual guide who helps him to realize he's passed away and that he must move on to the next world. After trying with only limited success to communicate with the devastated Annie, Chris moves on and discovers an afterlife that can become whatever one envisions, where even his pet dog awaits him. What Chris envisions as paradise are the paintings of his wife, and he happily takes up residence there, awaiting the far-off day when Annie will eventually join him. He also meets his children, although they have chosen different appearances than the ones they had in life. Then tragedy strikes when Annie, inconsolable, commits suicide and goes to Hell. Although it is rarely done, Chris insists on traveling there, risking his eternal soul to save the woman he loves. Accompanied part of the way by Albert and a wizened guide called The Tracker (Max von Sydow), Chris finally reaches Annie in Hell, and must convince her of the truth in order to release her from her dark prison(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">At a time when Ugandan lawmakers have proposed a bill to make homosexuality punishable by death, filmmakers Katherine Fairfax Wright and Malika Zouhali-Worrall profile the country's first openly gay man and a religious leader who have put their lives on the line to fight for equality. In Uganda homosexuals are known as "kuchus" and face brutal discrimination for their sexual orientation. Amidst swelling anti-homosexual sentiments in both the government and the local communities, activist David Kato comes out as openly gay, and wages a valiant fight to repeal his country's fiercely homophobic laws. Meanwhile, Bishop Christopher Senyonjo, a rare religious supporter of gay rights in Uganda, finds himself excommunicated from the church over his support of the LGBT community. Later, when David is brutally murdered just weeks after a notable legal victory for the community, a new generation of gay advocates begins to rise up, and challenge their oppressors(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Night Call</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Night Call. This eerie Twilight Zone entry was scripted by Richard Matheson from his own short story "Long Distance Call." In her third appearance on the series, Gladys Cooper plays elderly, embittered spinster Elva Keene. Already nervous and high-strung, Elva becomes even more so when she begins receiving mysterious, cryptic telephone calls in the dead of night. Could this be the work of pranksters, or is Wanda being besieged by the ghost of her long-dead fiancée Brian? Originally scheduled for broadcast on November 22, 1963, "Night Call" was moved to February 7, 1964 as a result of the JFK assassination coverage(n)</desc>

Alas, the project all but dies aborning thanks to the well-meaning but ill-advised interference of network executives and censors (this is one of the few episodes in which Kelly's cleavage is NOT on display). Not surprisingly, inside jokes abound in this episode, ranging from the posters for various faux TV series adorning the walls of the network offices, to the name of the character played by Jon Lovitz (a delightfully nasty swipe at the then-head of NBC's entertainment division)(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Pilot. The discovery of a badly decomposed corpse in an Arlington National Cemetery pond proves the catalyst that launches this Fox series detailing the adventures of a brilliant forensic anthropologist and her talented but egotistical partner. A body needs identifying, and FBI Special Agent Seely Booth (David Boreanaz) knows that there's no one more qualified for the job than renowned forensic anthropologist and best-selling author Dr. Temperance Brennan (Emily Deschanel). Affectionately dubbed "Bones" by Agent Booth, Dr. Brennan at first refuses to participate in the investigation unless she is promised full participation in the case. Agent Booth reluctantly agrees to Dr. Brennan's terms, and it isn't long before Dr. Brennan' preliminary investigation yields some interesting results. Later, at the Jeffersonian, Dr. Brennan's boss Dr. Goodman responds to his employee's complaints about working with the FBI by informing her that she works for a federally funded agency and Dr. Brennan's staff at the Medico-Legal Lab set about examining the remains in closer detail. When a revolutionary new program leads the team to believe that the body is that if a missing intern who had been rumored to be sleeping with a senator, Dr. Brennan wants to confront the powerful politician. Upon discovering that what they though were frog bones in the corpse's stomach were actually fetal bones, an already complicated case takes a decidedly unsettling turn(n)</desc>
