    <desc lang="en">Joe Darrow works as a doctor in the emergency room of Chicago Memorial Hospital. His wife, Emily Darrow, was last seen in a rainstorm in Venezuela, where she was on a retreat with the Red Cross offering humanitarian aid. She vanished in a bus accident. There were no survivors and her body was never found. That rich, green, exotic land is left behind as Joe is challenged to persevere through sad, rainy days back home. Joe promised Emily that if anything ever happened to her, he would visit her patients in the oncology ward. Strangely, the children seem to know him, and they say they've seen Emily in their near-death experiences. Joe starts to believe that his wife is using the near-death experiences of her terminal patients to communicate with him, through images the children report seeing in their dreams, and symbols they are inexplicably compelled to draw. While the children see Joe as a kindred spirit, the hospital staff worries about how these interactions are agitating them. At home, Joe begins finding other ethereal evidence of his wife's attempt to contact him from beyond the grave, some of it featuring the image of a dragonfly, which was the shape of the birthmark on her shoulder. His friends and a caring neighbor (Kathy Bates) worry that Joe is losing his marbles, especially as his quest becomes more frantic, putting his job in jeopardy(n)</desc>

And it's one that could rescue the professional life of subway employee Walter Garber, whose glittering career has been derailed by allegations of corruption. Garber is languishing on duty as a train dispatcher when all hell breaks loose after one of the Lexington Avenue line trains is hijacked by a gang led by the supremely self-assured, dispassionately ruthless Ryder. Ryder issues a demand for $10m and makes it clear that he won't hesitate to kill anyone who gets in his way. Garber and NYPD hostage negotiator Lieutenant Camonetti attempt to get to grips with the crisis but, as events progress, suspicions arise as to whether there's more to the hijacking than first meets the eye. Also starring James Gandolfini as New York's mayor and Luis Guzmán as a disgruntled subway worker who has joined Ryder's gang(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Johnson Family Vacation</title>
    <desc lang="en">Comedian Cedric the Entertainer serves as both producer and star of this comedy about a family who discovers just how much can go wrong en route to a family get-together. When Nate Johnson (Cedric the Entertainer) is invited to a big family reunion in Missouri, he sees it as an opportunity to reconnect with his estranged wife and growing children, as well as a chance to show up his wealthier know-it-all brother, Mack (Steve Harvey). Nate takes delivery on an expensive new SUV, persuades his recently separated wife, Dorothy (Vanessa L. Williams), to tag along, and packs up his three kids -- nubile teenager Nikki (Solange Knowles), under-age wannabe rapper D.J. (Bow Wow), and precocious seven-year-old Destiny (Gabby Soleil) -- for what he imagines will be a leisurely drive from Los Angeles to St. Louis. However, between his wary wife, arguing kids, angry police officers, bizarre hitchhikers, bad diner food, and an unfortunate run-in with a cement mixer, getting from point A to point B proves to be just short of a nightmare. Johnson Family Vacation was the first feature film for director Christopher Erskin, who previously distinguished himself directing music videos for the likes of Missy Elliot, TLC, and Boyz II Men(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Stir of Echoes</title>
    <desc lang="en">In this supernatural thriller, Tom Witzky (Kevin Bacon) is a fairly typical working-class guy living in Chicago with his wife Maggie (Kathryn Erbe) and his son Jake (Zachary David Cope). One night at a party, Tom gets into a lively discussion with his sister-in-law, Lisa (Illeana Douglas), who believes in psychic communication and the power of hypnosis. He challenges Lisa to hypnotize him, and she plants in him a post-hypnotic suggestion to be more open-minded. But the results aren't quite what Lisa or Tom expected; Tom now senses an air of terrible dread throughout his house and is convinced that evil lurks just around the corner. He also sees the spirit of a girl from the neighborhood who disappeared months ago -- and Jake sees the spirit as well. Stir of Echoes was based on a novel by Richard Matheson, whose work inspired such disparate films as Somewhere in Time and The Incredible Shrinking Man; it was written and directed by David Koepp, who wrote the screenplays for Jurassic Park and Mission: Impossible(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Daredevil</title>
    <desc lang="en">Mark Steven Johnson's violent superhero fantasy-morality play stars Ben Affleck as Matt Murdock, a guilt-wracked blind vigilante with a penchant for red leather. During his childhood, an accident involving toxic waste blinded Murdock, but it also enhanced his other senses and gave him a kind of 'radar vision'. The incident was partially caused by his discovery that his father was involved with the Mob. Now, the adult Murdock, spurred partly by Catholic guilt over his role in his father's death, has dedicated this life to fighting crime and protecting the innocent. By day Murdock's a defence lawyer, but by night he dispenses summary justice to criminals who've escaped the courts. Things get complicated when he falls in love with Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner). Not only is she the daughter of a man with connections to New York crime bosses but, unknown to Murdock, she's also a vigilante who's equally keen on figure-hugging leather (black in her case). And when Daredevil is framed for the murder of her father, Elektra swears vengeance on the masked crime-fighter (not realising that he's her lover). Meanwhile, both of them are in mortal danger from the actual killer, a merciless Irish assassin called Bullseye (Colin Farrell)(n)</desc>

The film traces the roots of the hippies to a 19th-century German sect of wandering naturalists that brought its freethinking ideas to California after the Second World War. There it merged with people expressing an interest in Eastern mystical concepts of human nature expounded by thinkers like Aleister Crowley and Aldous Huxley. Added to the mix was the CIA-developed drug LSD and a wave of student activists and anti-war protestors. The outcome was San Francisco's Summer of Love.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Elton John, Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard, Alabama Shakes, Jack White, Nas, Ana Gabriel, Beck, Los Lobos and Steve Martin are among the modern artists who test their skills against the demands of the recording machine that literally made American music. There are no edits, no overdubs, and no retakes, and the disc only allows for three minutes of recording time. Despite these limitations, today's recordings for American Epic have one advantage - the freshly recorded sound is crystal clear and of an astonishing depth, transporting listeners vividly into the past - and the future. Narrated by Robert Redford. Last in the series.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A look back at the decade that brought many opportunities for eye-popping errors, but few more ill-conceived than sitcom Heil Honey I'm Home!, which featured fictionalised versions of Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun living next door to a Jewish couple.

    <desc lang="en">Screenwriter Randall Wallace, a specialist in sweeping historical epics, steps behind the camera for this fact-based Vietnam War drama that reunites him with his Braveheart (1995) star Mel Gibson. Gibson is Lt. Col. Hal Moore, commander of the First Battalion, Seventh Cavalry, the same regiment fatefully led by George Armstrong Custer. As part of the Pleiku Campaign of late 1965, Moore is assigned to an action at Landing Zone X-Ray in the Drang Valley, an area that would come to be known as the "The Valley of Death." Moore soon finds himself and his men contained to an area about the size of a football field, surrounded by more than 2,000 enemy troops and engaged in the first major battle of the war. Heroism becomes the order of the day as men like Moore, chopper pilot Bruce Crandall (Greg Kinnear), and Lt. Henry Herrick (Marc Blucas) refuse to yield, in spite of heavy losses of life. The film co-stars Madeleine Stowe, Chris Klein, Keri Russell, and Sam Elliott. We Were Soldiers is based on the book We Were Soldiers Once...and Young by Lt. Gen. Harold G.

    <desc lang="en">Screenwriter Randall Wallace, a specialist in sweeping historical epics, steps behind the camera for this fact-based Vietnam War drama that reunites him with his Braveheart (1995) star Mel Gibson. Gibson is Lt. Col. Hal Moore, commander of the First Battalion, Seventh Cavalry, the same regiment fatefully led by George Armstrong Custer. As part of the Pleiku Campaign of late 1965, Moore is assigned to an action at Landing Zone X-Ray in the Drang Valley, an area that would come to be known as the "The Valley of Death." Moore soon finds himself and his men contained to an area about the size of a football field, surrounded by more than 2,000 enemy troops and engaged in the first major battle of the war. Heroism becomes the order of the day as men like Moore, chopper pilot Bruce Crandall (Greg Kinnear), and Lt. Henry Herrick (Marc Blucas) refuse to yield, in spite of heavy losses of life. The film co-stars Madeleine Stowe, Chris Klein, Keri Russell, and Sam Elliott. We Were Soldiers is based on the book We Were Soldiers Once...and Young by Lt. Gen. Harold G. Moore (retired) and UPI reporter Joe Galloway (played in the film by Barry Pepper)(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Bernie Fineman and Mario Pacione return to seek out more classics in need of restoration, beginning with a Porsche 928 that has suffered from years of water damage. The car's bubbled paintwork, seized brakes and rusting nuts, bolts and screws seem bad enough, but it gets worse when the vehicle's complicated electrics go haywire and trap Mario inside. Once Bernie and his team of mechanics have serviced the engine, the car is taken to a rolling road to put it through its paces, before former racing driver Paul O'Neill assesses its value to see if all the work has been worthwhile.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">The Fiat 500.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The duo restore a Fiat 500, which was Italy's answer to the Mini when it was launched in July 1957 and marketed as a cheap, practical and fuel-efficient town car. Bernie Fineman immediately puts Mario Pacione's nose out of joint by spending £1,500 on a bright orange wreck that will not even start and makes matters worse by laying out another £2,000 behind his back to coax an extra six brake horsepower out of the 500cc engine. Former racing driver Paul O'Neill judges their efforts and decides whether Bernie's improvements make the difference between a profit and a loss. Plus, the car's history is charted through archive footage, revealing what inspired the designers and why their creation was such a success.(n)</desc>

Inspired by actual events, Marc Forster's Machine Gun Preacher stars Gerard Butler as Sam Childers, a tough-as-nails biker whose heart shatters upon witnessing the harrowing plight of children in Sudan. Determined that no child shall be enslaved by the brutal Lord's Resistance Army, Childers turns to God for inspiration, and establishes an orphanage for wounded kids and child soldiers. When the Lord's Resistance Army refuses to stand down, Childers organizes a militia to protect the children. In helping to give the orphans of war-torn Sudan a better future, the former outlaw begins to find new meaning in his own life as well(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Jaws 3</title>
    <desc lang="en">An ocean-themed Florida amusement park comes under attack from an angry Great White shark in this third installment of the horror series. The film maintains only a loose relationship to the original Steven Spielberg hit, centering on Mike (Dennis Quaid) and Sean (John Putch), the sons of police chief Martin Brody (originally played by Roy Scheider). Mike works at Sea World, where a baby Great White shark has accidentially been let into the park. Soon, the baby's vicious and extremely powerful mother comes in search of her child. The film focuses most of its attention on the series of tense shark attacks that follow, as tourists run for their lives while the park workers struggle to destroy the sharp-toothed beast. The suspense sequences were made somewhat more memorable during the film's original release with 3-D photography, an attribute lost on video, thereby removing the most distinctive element of an otherwise run-of-the-mill sequel(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A policeman plays Good Samaritan to a visitor from Ireland, only to discover that he has a potentially deadly secret. Belfast-born Frankie McGuire (Brad Pitt) saw his father gunned down by enemy soldiers at the age of eight, and when he grew up he joined the Irish Republican Army, determined that one day his father's death would be avenged. An especially ruthless "volunteer," Frankie is responsible for the death of 13 British soldiers and 11 policemen. After a particularly bloody battle, Frankie sails to the United States in a ragged tugboat he has restored; with a huge bundle of cash, Frankie intends to buy a stock of Stinger missiles from an underground arms dealer in America, Billy Burke (Treat Williams). Upon arrival in New York, Frankie is met by a judge who is sympathetic to the IRA's cause and who arranges a place for him to stay. Using the name Rory Devaney, Frankie moves into the home of Tom O'Meara (Harrison Ford), a scrupulously honest cop. Tom is already in the midst of a personal crisis; his friend and partner Edwin Diaz (Ruben Blades) recently shot a man that he knew was unarmed in the line of duty, and while Edwin wants Tom to help him cover up the matter, Tom's conscience will not allow it. When Tom begins to realize that "Rory" is not simply a man running from the violence of his homeland, he's torn between his sympathy for Frankie's tragic childhood and his desire to see justice served and prevent needless death in Ireland(n)</desc>

The house is very dull, except for a large, ornate wardrobe discovered by young Lucy during a game of hide-and-seek. Venturing inside of it in the hopes of finding a hiding place, Lucy is transported to a snowy alternate universe: a magical world called Narnia. The land is populated by talking animals and ruled over by the benevolent lion god Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson), but sadly, the world is also in a state of perpetual winter. The white witch Jadis (Tilda Swinton), lustful for power and governed by narcissism, has cursed Narnia with a tyrannical decree that it will always be winter but never Christmas. Now, the children must fight alongside Aslan for the salvation of Narnia, but one of them, seduced by the charisma of the white witch, may choose to fight on the wrong side(n)</desc>

The house is very dull, except for a large, ornate wardrobe discovered by young Lucy during a game of hide-and-seek. Venturing inside of it in the hopes of finding a hiding place, Lucy is transported to a snowy alternate universe: a magical world called Narnia. The land is populated by talking animals and ruled over by the benevolent lion god Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson), but sadly, the world is also in a state of perpetual winter. The white witch Jadis (Tilda Swinton), lustful for power and governed by narcissism, has cursed Narnia with a tyrannical decree that it will always be winter but never Christmas. Now, the children must fight alongside Aslan for the salvation of Narnia, but one of them, seduced by the charisma of the white witch, may choose to fight on the wrong side(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Do the Right Thing</title>
    <desc lang="en">Set in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn, Spike Lee's thought-provoking and powerful comedy/drama chronicles the events that lead up to a race riot between the residents. The action takes place on the hottest day of the year and centers around a pizza parlor owned by Italian-American Sal. It's a popular hangout for the neighborhood youth. The events leading up to the confrontation are presented episodically and center around, Sal (Danny Aiello), his aimless employee Mookie (Spike Lee) and his pal, the radical Buggin Out (Giancarlo Esposito), who is irritated that Sal's "Wall of Fame" (containing only pictures of famous Italian-Americans) contains no African-American faces and therefore tries unsuccessfully to get the neighborhood blacks, including Mookie, to boycott the restaurant. Radio Raheem, with his blaring boom box permanently affixed to his shoulder, inadvertently becomes the catalyst for violence. As the stories unfold and many colorful satellite characters and their lives are introduced, the temperature rises. With the constant bickering between Mookie and the other employees, the harassment of Buggin Out, and other events, Sal is pushed to the breaking point and makes a fateful decision. Already stressed out and overheated, Sal snaps at closing time when Radio Raheem show up and demands service at the last minute. Violence and tragedy ensue(n)</desc>

Season Five of Monk begins as San Francisco's most efficient--and most obsessive-compulsive--private detective Adrian Monk (Tony Shalhoub) finds himself the central character of an upcoming movie. Much to Monk's relief, he won't be forced to play himself: Instead, the role of Monk has gone to Hollywood superstar David Ruskin (Stanley Tucci). Unfortunately, Ruskin is one of those method actors who insists upon meticulous pre-film research, and soon he is relentlessly dogging Monk's trail during a murder investigation. At first, Monk doesn't seem to mind, and actually enjoys showing off for Ruskin's benefit--but things take a sinister turn when Ruskin so loses himself in the role of "Adrian Monk" that he tries to exact his own personal vengeance against a suspect in the long-ago murder of Monk's wife Trudy!(n)</desc>

Monk (Tony Shalhoub) of course suspects murder, but this seems unlikely since Lynn apparently had no enemies. To get to the truth, Monk signs up as assistant to the school's interim coach, who happens to be Julie's mom (and Monk's caregiver) Natalie (Traylor Howard). Amidst a great deal of personal agony over having to actually stoop to physical exertion (and in a sweaty, smelly high school gym to boot) Monk uncovers a link between Lynn's demise and a recent forest fire--to say nothing of a similarly suspicious death at a country club three years before(n)</desc>

Despite facing the probability of permanent sightlessness, Monk insists upon solving the old man's murder, using his previously unexploited "sixth sense" to harvest clues. It turns out that there is a connection between Rusty's missing coat and helmet, and another fire that occurred at the same time as the murder. In a fit of hubris (he actually seems to thrive on being blind), Monk not only captures the killer, but also figures out that the culprit didn't act alone...and that there's a lot more to the story than a mere murder(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Band-Aid Covers the Bullet Hole. Bailey (Chandra Wilson) refuses to stay on maternity leave, saddling a reluctant Cristina (Sandra Oh) with babysitting duty--as if Cristina doesn't have enough trouble with Burke (Isaiah Washington). Meredith (Ellen Pompeo) has yet to get over her night with George (T.R. Knight), while Derek (Patrick Dempsey) and Addison (Kate Walsh) can't get past the problem of Mark Sloan. In a similar "triangle" situation, Alex (Justin Chambers) feels like the proverbial fifth wheel out as Izzie (Katherine Heigl) and Denny (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) grow closer. Meanwhile, the roster of patients is a strange one indeed, ranging from a terminal ill woman (Anne Moore) with a fork stuck in her neck, and a hockey player (Teddy Dunn) who demands that Callie (Sara Ramirez) amputate his least useful finger(n)</desc>

When Godiva passes away on the eve of the parade, Emmett is understandably distraught, and he isn't sure how to best honor her memory. Deb (Sharon Gless), who calls it "The High Homo Holidays," is marching with her PFLAG group and is upset, as always, that Michael (Hal Sparks) won't march beside her. He's worried about being seen by somebody from his job, but Deb's guilt trip gets him to agree to march. Then he finds out that a group of people from work is going to the parade to check out "the freaks," and he changes his mind again. Lindsay (Thea Gill) is less than thrilled when Leda (Nancy Sakovich), Mel's (Michelle Clunie) old girlfriend from her wilder days, shows up for the parade, reminisces about old times, and gets Mel to drag out the motorcycle she's had stashed away in the garage. Ted (Scott Lowell) wants to experience a little sexual freedom, but he's surprised when a hot young stud (Lee Rumohr) picks him up at Woody's and fulfills his wish. When Justin (Randy Harrison) accompanies Emmett to the AIDS hospice where Godiva died, he runs into a familiar and very unwelcome face.

    <desc lang="en">One of the most popular superhero teams in comic book history finally comes to the screen in this big-budget adaptation of the long-running Marvel Comics series. Psychic Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) leads a school of skilled mutants called X-Men, a peacekeeping force to safeguard the world against a race of genetically mutated humans known as Homo Sapiens Superior. However, Magneto (Ian McKellen), a mutant with a powerful magnetic charge, has also begun to organize a team to strike first against what he believes to be a threat from humanity. When he kidnaps Rogue (Anna Paquin) from the X-Men's compound, Xavier and his forces must rescue her, even as they continue to vie with Magneto for the fearsomely strong mutant battler Wolverine (Hugh Jackman). Both Xavier and Magneto also have to contend with Senator Kelly (Bruce Davison), a heartless political leader who wants a final solution against mutants on both sides. Fighting for the forces of virtue with the X-Men are Famke Janssen as Jean Grey, Halle Berry as Storm, and James Marsden as Cyclops; Rebecca Romjin-Stamos as Mystique, Ray Park as the Toad, and Tyler Mane as Sabretooth are the minions of Magneto(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Wet Hot American Summer</title>
    <desc lang="en">1980s teen comedies finally get the parody they so richly deserve with Wet Hot American Summer, the first feature film from writer/director David Wain and co-screenwriter Michael Showalter, formerly of the sketch comedy troupe the State. It's the last day of the summer season at Camp Firewood, and as camp director Beth (Janeane Garofalo) prepares to wrap things up, the staff of teenage counselors realize this is their last chance to do something about the summer romances that have been brewing for the past three months. Sweet but shy Coop (Michael Showalter) is crazy about pretty Katie (Marguerite Moreau), but there's the problem of her severely moody boyfriend Andy (Paul Rudd). Meanwhile, Victor (Ken Marino) is trying to score with sexy Abby (Marisa Ryan), who is known to make friends easily, and McKinley (Michael Ian Black) and Ben (Bradley Cooper) attempt to keep their hot and heavy relationship a secret. Meanwhile, arts and crafts teacher Gail (Molly Shannon) turns to her students for comfort as her marriage falls apart, drama coach Susie (Amy Poehler) tries to whip the talent show into shape with Ben's help, and camp chef Gene (Christopher Meloni) deals with his unique sexual quirks with the help of a talking can of vegetables (voiced by H. Jon Benjamin). Beth even finds time for romance with socially inept astrophysicist Henry (David Hyde Pierce), but first Henry has to save Camp Firewood from a large piece of space junk about to re-enter Earth's atmosphere. Like Wain and Showalter, Ken Marino, Michael Ian Black, and Joe Lo Truglio (who appears in a small role) were also members of the State; fellow State alumnus Kerri Kenney was cast in a supporting role in the film, but her character didn't appear in the final cut(n)</desc>

Simon (Bill Paxton) seduces Helen with the lie that he is a secret agent; he's really a used car salesman. Harry suspects that Helen is cheating on him, and he sends a few colleagues to kidnap them. Helen then discovers that Harry is a secret agent by night, working for a shadowy group called the Omega Sector.

    <title lang="en">Wet Hot American Summer</title>
    <desc lang="en">1980s teen comedies finally get the parody they so richly deserve with Wet Hot American Summer, the first feature film from writer/director David Wain and co-screenwriter Michael Showalter, formerly of the sketch comedy troupe the State. It's the last day of the summer season at Camp Firewood, and as camp director Beth (Janeane Garofalo) prepares to wrap things up, the staff of teenage counselors realize this is their last chance to do something about the summer romances that have been brewing for the past three months. Sweet but shy Coop (Michael Showalter) is crazy about pretty Katie (Marguerite Moreau), but there's the problem of her severely moody boyfriend Andy (Paul Rudd). Meanwhile, Victor (Ken Marino) is trying to score with sexy Abby (Marisa Ryan), who is known to make friends easily, and McKinley (Michael Ian Black) and Ben (Bradley Cooper) attempt to keep their hot and heavy relationship a secret. Meanwhile, arts and crafts teacher Gail (Molly Shannon) turns to her students for comfort as her marriage falls apart, drama coach Susie (Amy Poehler) tries to whip the talent show into shape with Ben's help, and camp chef Gene (Christopher Meloni) deals with his unique sexual quirks with the help of a talking can of vegetables (voiced by H. Jon Benjamin). Beth even finds time for romance with socially inept astrophysicist Henry (David Hyde Pierce), but first Henry has to save Camp Firewood from a large piece of space junk about to re-enter Earth's atmosphere.

    <title lang="en">The Family Stone</title>
    <desc lang="en">A woman meets her future in-laws and discovers they don't much care for her in this comedy from writer and director Thomas Bezucha. Everett Stone (Dermot Mulroney) is a successful young businessman who is dating Meredith Morton (Sarah Jessica Parker), and has asked her to spend Christmas with his family, with plans to ask his mother, Sybil (Diane Keaton), for the titular family wedding band and propose to Meredith on Christmas Day. Meredith is more than a bit nervous about meeting Everett's folks, and things only get worse when they arrive -- Meredith is by her nature straight-laced and a bit uptight around strangers, while Sybil and family patriarch Kelly (Craig T. Nelson) are free-thinkers who, except for Everett, have raised a family of cheerfully rebellious children, most notably younger daughter Amy (Rachel McAdams), older brother Ben (Luke Wilson), and adopted sibling Thad (Tyrone Giordano), who is both deaf and gay. Meredith and the Stone family do not get along well at first, especially Sybil, who is appalled at the prospect of Everett giving Meredith the family's heirloom wedding ring; in dire need of moral support, Meredith asks her younger sister, Julie (Claire Danes), to join her for Christmas with the Stones. However, the plan runs into a snag when Everett's head is turned by pretty Julie, and Meredith finds herself on the receiving end of attention from slobby Ben(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Dr. Strangelove Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb</title>
    <desc lang="en">Producer/director Stanley Kubrick had intended to make a serious film version of Peter George's apocalyptic novel Red Alert, but halfway through the adaptation process, he switched gears, and the result was Dr. Strangelove, one of the funniest and blackest comedies of the 1960s. At Burpleson Air Force base ("Peace is Our Profession"), psychotic general Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) pontificates on the subject of Godless Communism. Convinced that the Kremlin intends to sap Americans of their "precious bodily fluids," Ripper has ordered a presumptive air strike against the Soviet Union. Apprised of a potential nuclear crisis, US President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) tries to phone the Soviet premier, who is too drunk to grasp the situation. As apelike General "Buck" Turgidson (George C. Scott) struts about the War Room, discussing possible losses in an atomic war ("I don't say we won't get our hair mussed, but I do say no more than 10 to 20 million killed, tops-depending on the breaks"), Captain Lionel Mandrake (Sellers again) tries to infiltrate Ripper's office, hoping to retrieve the secret code that will recall the bombers. Learning that the Soviets have developed a "doomsday device" that will wipe out all mankind in case of a nuclear attack, the President orders that Ripper's bombers be blasted from the skies. But one of the planes, commandeered by Major "King" Kong (Slim Pickens-though Peter Sellers was slated to play this role, too!) manages to slip through and continue its mission. With time running out, Mandrake attempts to reach the President with the crucial code, only to be slowed down by over-militant Colonel "Bat" Guano (Keenan Wynn), who regards Mandrake as a "prevert". The president manages to relay the code to Kong, who disregards this vital information as a Russian trick. Reaching his target, Kong dislodges his recalcitrant A-bomb, straddling the deadly weapon and "riding" it to destruction like a bronco-buster. With the world at large doomed to annihilation, it is up to Dr. Strangelove (Peter Sellers yet again!), the President's crippled, half-lunatic nuclear adviser, to come up with a plan to repopulate the Earth-a plan that meets with the drooling approval of the lecherous Turgidson. He was secure enough in his comic vision to blow up the world at the end, even though the original novel has a happy ending. The film's subtitle How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love The Bomb is beautifully elucidated in the closing scene: as mushroom clouds spout up all over the earth, the soothing voice of Vera Lynn, singing the wartime morale-booster "We'll Meet Again" assures us that, indeed, there is nothing left to worry about. As for the film's best line of dialogue, it's a toss-up between President Muffley's "Gentlemen, you can't fight in here. This is the War Room" and Dr. Strangelove's exultant "Mein Fuhrer! I can walk!"(n)</desc>

Set in pre-revolutionary China, Chow plays Sing, a street hustler who makes the mistake of pretending to be a member of the notorious Axe gang. He becomes caught up in a war between the gang and the residents of Pig Sty Alley, which the gang want to take over. Little do they know that two of the Alley's residents are retired martial arts experts and soon the fists and feet are flying in knockabout fights that owe as much to Kill Bill (some of the wire work is done by Yuen Wo Ping, who worked on Tarantino's film) as they do to classic Hollywood silent comedies. Film fans can enjoy Chow's references to films ranging from Top Hat to The Shining while the rest can just enjoy a wildly entertaining romp. In Cantonese with English subtitles(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Shot in black-and-white and set in small-town California in the late '40s, this latest film from Joel Coen and brother Ethan Coen is a throwback to vintage film noir. Recalling Alfred Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt in its setting of Santa Rosa, CA, the story follows the dutiful, passive barber Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton), who narrates the tale. A soft-spoken fellow, Ed is greeted by Creighton Tolliver (played by Coen regular Jon Polito), a chatterbox customer who tells Ed that dry cleaning is the wave of the future. When Ed discovers his wife Doris (Frances McDormand) has been cheating on him with her department store boss Big Dave (James Gandolfini), Ed suddenly turns bitterly jealous. He hatches a blackmail scheme to extort money from Big Dave to fund a dry cleaning enterprise, which takes a wrong turn when Big Dave ends up dead. Meanwhile, Doris is charged with Dave's murder, having been found doctoring the books at her job, and Ed hires an impeccable new lawyer (Tony Shalhoub), who proves costly in the midst of his already unraveling life. The film also co-stars Michael Badalucco, Katherine Borowitz, and Scarlet Johanssen(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Undertaking Betty</title>
    <desc lang="en">Directed by Nick Hurran, Undertaking Betty revolves around the competitive world of undertaking in the Welsh countryside. One of the most respected names in the biz -- Plotz Funeral Homes -- is directed by Boris Plotz (Alfred Molina), whose youthful dreams consisted of two decidedly cheerier concepts than the embalming process: dancing and marrying his childhood crush, Betty Rhys-Jones (Brenda Blethyn). Unfortunately, the pressure to take over the family business became too much for Boris to resist, particularly after Betty, despite being secretly in love with Boris, was married off to a known gold digger. Both Betty and Boris' lives remain firmly status quo until the death of Betty's mother-in-law, whose funeral arrangements throw the unsatisfied couple back together. While the spark between Betty and Boris is reignited, rival funeral director Frank Featherbed (Christopher Walken) grows increasingly angry; the American funeral director desperately wants to revolutionize the U.K. undertaking business with his unique "theme" funerals. Ultimately, Boris and Betty resort to desperate measures -- since the only thing keeping him away from Betty is her two-timing husband, they decide to stage Betty's demise and elope somewhere far away from the death business(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">What Dreams May Come</title>
    <desc lang="en">Based on a metaphysical 1978 novel by science fiction and horror author Richard Matheson, this romantic fantasy-drama won an Oscar for its expensive and impressive visual vistas depicting an imaginative afterlife. Robin Williams stars as Chris Nielsen, a doctor who has suffered with his artist wife Annie (Annabella Sciorra) through the devastating loss of their children, Marie and Ian, who were killed in a car accident. Although Annie's all-consuming depression nearly destroyed their marriage, the couple rebuilt their relationship and are now living out a comfortable middle age. Stopping one night to help a motorist in a wreck, Chris is struck by a car and killed. At first confused about where he is, Chris meets Albert (Cuba Gooding Jr.), a spiritual guide who helps him to realize he's passed away and that he must move on to the next world. After trying with only limited success to communicate with the devastated Annie, Chris moves on and discovers an afterlife that can become whatever one envisions, where even his pet dog awaits him. What Chris envisions as paradise are the paintings of his wife, and he happily takes up residence there, awaiting the far-off day when Annie will eventually join him. He also meets his children, although they have chosen different appearances than the ones they had in life. Then tragedy strikes when Annie, inconsolable, commits suicide and goes to Hell. Although it is rarely done, Chris insists on traveling there, risking his eternal soul to save the woman he loves. Accompanied part of the way by Albert and a wizened guide called The Tracker (Max von Sydow), Chris finally reaches Annie in Hell, and must convince her of the truth in order to release her from her dark prison(n)</desc>

Following her mother's death, Andie (Evigan) finds comfort in her love of dancing. She's a member of the Baltimore 410 crew (named after one of the city's dialling codes), reigning champions of an underground freestyle dancing competition called The Streets. However, unhappy at her school performance and the 410's shady reputation, Andie's guardian Sarah (Sonja Sohn) threatens to send the teen to live with her aunt in Texas. Andie evades that fate by enrolling in the Maryland School of the Arts. But the move alienates her from the 410 and estrangement turns to fierce rivalry when Andie puts together a new crew with her MSA friends, who set their sights on taking The Streets title for themselves.

    <title lang="en">The Velveteen Rabbit</title>
    <desc lang="en">Live-action filmmaking mixes with imaginative animation in director Michael Landon Jr.'s feature adaptation of author Margery Williams' beloved children's book. An energetic child with a vivid imagination, Toby Morgan (Matthew Harbour) lives with his father (Kevin Jubinville), a successful businessman who seemed to shut down emotionally following the death of Toby's mother. When Toby is sent to spend the Christmas holidays with his loving but stern grandmother (Una Kay), he wanders through the lonely house until he eventually discovers the "magic attic" that was once his father's childhood playroom. There, Toby is surprised to find that his mother left him a stuffed velveteen rabbit -- her final gift to her beloved son. Hugging the rabbit close as he starts to cry, the grieving boy watches in wonder as his tears magically bring the toy to life. Before long, Toby is frolicking in the enchanted attic with a whole new group of friends, including the impetuous Horse (voiced by Tom Skerritt) and the wise but skittish Swan (voice of Ellen Burstyn). Toby's one wish is to spend Christmas with his father, and Rabbit's one wish is to someday hop across the fields as a real rabbit. Later, when Toby falls seriously ill, the courageous Rabbit helps him to win over his grandmother and make a full recovery. When Toby's father returns in time for Christmas, the power of the young child's love grants the Velveteen Rabbit its one true wish(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">(2008) Briana Evigan stars in this musical drama whose focus is firmly on its spectacular dance sequences. Following her mother's death, Andie (Evigan) finds comfort in her love of dancing. She's a member of the Baltimore 410 crew (named after one of the city's dialling codes), reigning champions of an underground freestyle dancing competition called The Streets. However, unhappy at her school performance and the 410's shady reputation, Andie's guardian Sarah (Sonja Sohn) threatens to send the teen to live with her aunt in Texas. Andie evades that fate by enrolling in the Maryland School of the Arts. But the move alienates her from the 410 and estrangement turns to fierce rivalry when Andie puts together a new crew with her MSA friends, who set their sights on taking The Streets title for themselves. Also starring Robert Hoffman as Andie's romantic interest. Edited for violence(n)</desc>

Jim White (Costner) finds his days as a football coach numbered when an incident with a player leads to his dismissal. Desperate for work, he moves his wife (Maria Bello) and daughters (Morgan Saylor and Elsie Fisher) from Idaho to McFarland, CA, a rural town that's predominately Latino and the only place willing to give him a teaching job. The family feel like they don't fit into their new community, but White has an epiphany one day when he sees his students running from their early-morning farming jobs to school: Why not channel their talents into running cross-country track? Soon enough, White is connecting with his young charges, particularly a gifted athlete named Thomas (Carlos Pratts), and the squad set their sights on a state championship(n)</desc>

Ricky Bobby (Ferrell) is a national hero with a "smokin' hot" trophy wife, pair of borderline-abusively precocious sons, and an endless line of endorsement deals filling his mansion with toys and driveway with sports cars and Hummers. His racing partner and lifelong friend Cal Naughton, Jr. (John C.

While the public loves these buddies (popularly known by the meaningless childhood nicknames they find so exceedingly cool: "Shake and Bake"), a wedge comes between the two, as Ricky Bobby's longstanding winning-streak is broken by flamboyand French Formula One driver Jean Girard (Sacha Baron Cohen), robbing Ricky of everything in an instant as the trauma leaves him unable to drive. Ricky's wife takes his fortunes while Cal takes his wife, and now he's back with his mother (Jane Lynch) and long-estranged father (Gary Cole). Things look bad for Ricky, but his father was once a race car driver himself, and now with the help of a training montage, a live cougar, and the courage to drive without his gleaming white Wonder Bread endorsement, Ricky might be ready to face the track again(n)</desc>
