    <title lang="en">The Restoration Man</title>
    <desc lang="en">After living in a bungalow for 25 years, Yorkshire couple Carol and Majid Nadry embark on an ambitious midlife adventure - buying a water tower to turn into a five-storey home. As they battle with the huge rusting tank on top of the building, they encounter devastating legal problems, and unexpected costs hit their budget. However, the pair refuse to give up on their mission to create a one-off design, and architect George Clarke encourages them to see their daunting challenge through, while detailing the seismic changes in architectural history that this structure's humble appearance conceals.(n)</desc>

Over dinner, the guests grill the pair over how they came to be in charge of their business at such a young age, but the genial atmosphere sours for Tina when she discovers Sheryl is a cordon-bleu trained chef.

    <title lang="en">Thirteen</title>
    <desc lang="en">Prolific production designer and art director Catherine Hardwicke makes her directorial debut with the coming-of-age drama Thirteen. Los Angeles teenager and overachiever Tracy (Evan Rachel Wood) is an excellent student in her seventh grade class and gets along well with her mother, Melanie (Holly Hunter). She fears that she's not cool enough to be friends with Evie (Nikki Reed), the most popular girl in school. Fueled with genuine adolescent energy, Tracy follows Evie's lead into the harsh realities of sex, drugs, and hard-edged adventure. Consumed with temptations and conflicting desires, Tracy loses her good-girl identity, greatly affecting her relationship with her mom. Partly autobiographical, Thirteen was co-written by Hardwicke and actual 13-year-old Reed, who are close family friends. Originally intending to write a teen comedy, they ended up creating a hard-hitting drama exposing the contemporary teenage experience. Thirteen was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival, with Catherine Hardwicke taking home the Director's Award(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Jimmy Kimmel Live</title>
    <desc lang="en">Chubby, cheeky comedian Jimmy Kimmel, late of cable TV's raunchy The Man Show, was launched in his own late-night ABC talk-variety series on January 26, 2003. Cashing in on Kimmel's patented profane irreverence, the series -- designed to go head-to-head with NBC's Late Night With Conan O'Brien and CBS' The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborne -- pushed the envelope of propriety and good taste farther than ABC had ever gone before. On the opening episode alone, a woozy George Clooney passed out booze to the studio audience, Snoop Dogg flipped a bird at the camera, and a spectator threw up, a spectacle lovingly described by the host. This prompted ABC to close the "open" bar that was the centerpiece of the first episode, and to tightly monitor all future programs, especially during the impromptu stunts perpetrated by the production crew on innocent bystanders outside the studio. Even without the threat of censorship from its parent network, Jimmy Kimmel Live did not appear to be long for this world, its already meager ratings diminishing with each new episode(n)</desc>

As a child, Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) lived a comfortable life as the son of wealthy parents, but the realities of life in crime-ridden Gotham City were brought home to him when his mother and father were murdered. Wayne pledged to bring justice and order back to the city and avenge the death of his parents, and one day he is approached by Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), a teacher who guides him in the study of martial arts and the ways in which an ordinary man can become a champion. With the help of Ducard and gadget master Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), Wayne develops a secret identity as Batman, a masked fighter for justice who is determined to bring peace and safety back to Gotham. Batman Begins also features Michael Caine as faithful manservant Alfred Pennyworth, Gary Oldman as Lt. James Gordon, Katie Holmes as Wayne's sweetheart, Rachel Dawes, and Cillian Murphy as the villainous Scarecrow(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Playful Creatures.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Though household pets have been trained over thousands of years, they were wild for millions more, and despite the fact that many have taken well to domestic life and provide valuable companionship, their natural instincts remain latent, but are able to be rekindled. David Tennant narrates the first of two programmes revealing the nation's favourite pets in a new light. From playful puppies to hamsters running on the wheel, via chirping budgerigars and scratching cats, the documentary illustrates how these apparently innocuous behavioural traits often conceal a more primitive significance. Cameras visit two islands in Japan, one crowded by rabbits and the other cats, while in Peru dogs leave their home comforts behind on a daily basis to meet up, fight and attempt to attract the interest of a bitch on heat.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Deceived</title>
    <desc lang="en">Goldie Hawn delivers a surprisingly understated performance (allowing the audience to shift their laughter from the usually comic Hawn to the unbelievable storyline) in the unsuccessful thriller Deceived. Hawn plays Adrienne Saunders, a successful art restorer who is married to Jack (John Heard), a devoted husband who is also an expert in the antiques business. Married for six years and parents of a charming 5-year-old daughter Mary (Ashley Peldon), the Saunders appear to have everything going for them. But after a series of odd occurrences that even an idiot would notice, Adrienne finally comes the conclusion that her husband is not the man she thought he was when she married him. After Jack tells Mary that he was in Boston but Adrienne's friend tells her she saw him in New York, the mysterious clues begin piling up and are too numerous to ignore: there's a call from a department store concerning some sexy lingerie that Jack purchased; a friend is found murdered after checking on the authenticity of an Egyptian necklace; and there are indications that Jack was involved with a scheme to steal artifacts from a museum. Adrienne is finally convinced that something is fishy about her husband when he mysteriously dies is an auto wreck, and she discovers that Jack has been using the name of a man who had died 16 years earlier. Adrienne proceeds to polish her magnifying glass and conducts some detective work on her own to find out who her husband really was. This is when the danger really begins(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Cinema icon Al Pacino joins a powerhouse cast headed by of George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, and series newcomer Ellen Barkin for this, the third installment of director Steven Soderbergh's popular series of glitzy crime comedies. The only hotelier in Las Vegas who can claim that each and every one of his establishments has earned the Royal Review Board's Five Diamond Award, Willy Bank (Pacino) has made more than his share of enemies during his impressive ascent. While most of Bank's adversaries amount to little more than the occasional nuisance, however, this powerful player is about to find out that picking your enemies in Las Vegas can be a true gamble. In betraying Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould), Bank has finally crossed the one man who could bring his entire empire crumbling to the ground -- Danny Ocean (Clooney). Now Reuben is in critical condition, and Ocean is determined to strike back at the man who nearly murdered his mentor. Bank may have taken down one of the original Ocean's Eleven, but his efforts only managed to unite the remaining ten closer than ever before. As the opening of Bank's newest casino draws near, Danny and the crew set into motion a bold plan to humiliate the cocksure casino owner and forever tarnish his spotless reputation. It won't be easy, but if Ocean and his team can get their elaborate plan together in time for the opening of The Bank, they just might be able to deliver some serious Las Vegas justice(n)</desc>

Married for six years and parents of a charming 5-year-old daughter Mary (Ashley Peldon), the Saunders appear to have everything going for them. But after a series of odd occurrences that even an idiot would notice, Adrienne finally comes the conclusion that her husband is not the man she thought he was when she married him. After Jack tells Mary that he was in Boston but Adrienne's friend tells her she saw him in New York, the mysterious clues begin piling up and are too numerous to ignore: there's a call from a department store concerning some sexy lingerie that Jack purchased; a friend is found murdered after checking on the authenticity of an Egyptian necklace; and there are indications that Jack was involved with a scheme to steal artifacts from a museum. Adrienne is finally convinced that something is fishy about her husband when he mysteriously dies is an auto wreck, and she discovers that Jack has been using the name of a man who had died 16 years earlier. Adrienne proceeds to polish her magnifying glass and conducts some detective work on her own to find out who her husband really was. This is when the danger really begins(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Cinema icon Al Pacino joins a powerhouse cast headed by of George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, and series newcomer Ellen Barkin for this, the third installment of director Steven Soderbergh's popular series of glitzy crime comedies. The only hotelier in Las Vegas who can claim that each and every one of his establishments has earned the Royal Review Board's Five Diamond Award, Willy Bank (Pacino) has made more than his share of enemies during his impressive ascent. While most of Bank's adversaries amount to little more than the occasional nuisance, however, this powerful player is about to find out that picking your enemies in Las Vegas can be a true gamble. In betraying Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould), Bank has finally crossed the one man who could bring his entire empire crumbling to the ground -- Danny Ocean (Clooney). Now Reuben is in critical condition, and Ocean is determined to strike back at the man who nearly murdered his mentor. Bank may have taken down one of the original Ocean's Eleven, but his efforts only managed to unite the remaining ten closer than ever before. As the opening of Bank's newest casino draws near, Danny and the crew set into motion a bold plan to humiliate the cocksure casino owner and forever tarnish his spotless reputation. It won't be easy, but if Ocean and his team can get their elaborate plan together in time for the opening of The Bank, they just might be able to deliver some serious Las Vegas justice(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Jeremy Clarkson and James May take a look at increasingly popular tall hatchbacks known as crossovers. Having concluded their primary appeal is to caravanners, the duo spend a couple of days in models by Mazda and Volkswagen and try to get a feel for what life is like for the people they believe would buy one. Meanwhile, Richard Hammond drives a pair of exciting Lamborghinis in Italy - the ferocious Aventador Roadster and the limited-edition Sesto Elemento, which carries an eye-watering price tag of around £2million. Two cars are also put through their paces on the test track, with James in a modern re-creation of the classic Porsche 911 and Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler in the rather less exotic Reasonably Priced Car.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Playful Creatures.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Though household pets have been trained over thousands of years, they were wild for millions more, and despite the fact that many have taken well to domestic life and provide valuable companionship, their natural instincts remain latent, but are able to be rekindled. David Tennant narrates the first of two programmes revealing the nation's favourite pets in a new light. From playful puppies to hamsters running on the wheel, via chirping budgerigars and scratching cats, the documentary illustrates how these apparently innocuous behavioural traits often conceal a more primitive significance. Cameras visit two islands in Japan, one crowded by rabbits and the other cats, while in Peru dogs leave their home comforts behind on a daily basis to meet up, fight and attempt to attract the interest of a bitch on heat.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Veterinary surgeon Mark Evans and comparative anatomist Joy Reidenberg explore the world of animal reproduction, looking at how different species find and attract a mate, give birth and raise their young in hostile habitats. In South Africa, Mark investigates how male elephants find females in vast home ranges, while in the Okavango Delta in Botswana, Joy sets up night-vision cameras for a rare look at the birth of a calf. The programme also reveals why these animals have the longest pregnancy of any mammal and how quickly a newborn takes its first steps.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Resurrecting the Champ</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director and co-screenwriter (along with Chris Gerolmo, Allison Burnett, and Michael Bortman) Rod Lurie tells the uplifting tale of a sports writer who almost lost it all before stumbling into the story of a lifetime in this uplifting sports-themed drama starring Josh Hartnett and Samuel L. Jackson. Erik (Hartnett) is a Denver-based sports writer whose prose is dull and whose marriage is failing. Not only is Erik having a difficult time dealing with his stubborn editor Metz (Alan Alda) - who refuses to take the suffering scribe off of the boxing beat - but the pain of being separated from his young son has weighed heavier on Erik's conscience than he could have ever imagined. When Erik sees a local homeless man (Samuel L. Jackson) being violently assaulted by a gang of sadistic street toughs, he instinctively comes to the suffering man's rescue. As fate would have, Erik discovers that the nondescript homeless man is actually the former boxing champion Battling Bob Satterfield, whom many sports fans had assumed dead. Now driven to tell the story that may establish him as a successful sports writer, Erik gradually begins to make the transformation from ordinary man to extraordinary champion - largely by turning inward and by reexamining his relationship with his own son(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Fever Pitch</title>
    <desc lang="en">Nick Hornby's acclaimed memoir about one man's struggle to balance his love of a woman and his love for soccer was the basis of a well-reviewed British film in 1997, and now gets a Americanized rewrite with this picture, in which the game is changed from soccer to baseball. Ben (Jimmy Fallon) is a high-school teacher who meets Lindsay (Drew Barrymore), who has a successful career in business. Ben and Lindsay don't appear to have much in common on the surface, but they hit it off and are soon involved in a serious romance. But when spring rolls around, Lindsay becomes aware of the true love of Ben's life -- the Boston Red Sox. Despite the team's lamentable record, Ben has been a fiercely loyal Red Sox fan since childhood, and Lindsay finds it hard to compete with his passion for baseball, while Ben is forced to choose between the obsessions of his youth and the enthusiasms of a responsible adult. Fever Pitch was shot in part in Boston during the 2004 baseball season, which to the surprise of the filmmakers saw the Red Sox winning baseball's world series for the first time since 1918(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Golfing drama about a washed-up old pro who tries to get back into the big time. Roy 'Tin Cup' McAvoy (Kevin Costner) ruined his career when he took a risk on the golf course which led to his disqualification from the game. Now he teaches golf to others at a driving range in Salome, Texas, with the help of his trusted friend Romeo Posar (Cheech Marin). But McAvoy's life starts to change when a new student walks into the training centre - Dr Molly Griswold (Rene Russo), who just happens to be dating PGA star David Simms (Don Johnson). To win Molly, 'Tin Cup' knows that he must impress her - and what better way than by beating Simms and winning the US Open? The problem, of course, is that 'Tin Cup' has been teaching golf for so long that he may have forgotten how to play!(n)</desc>

Astoundingly, David is not only alive, he hardly seems to have been touched. As David wonders what has happened to him and why he was able to walk away, he encounters a mysterious stranger, Elijah Prince (Samuel L. Jackson), who explains to David that there are a certain number of people who are "unbreakable" -- they have remarkable endurance and courage, a predisposition toward dangerous behavior, and feel invincible but also have strange premonitions of terrible events. Is David "unbreakable"? And if he is, what are the physical and psychological ramifications of this knowledge? Unbreakable also stars Robin Wright-Penn as Audrey, David's wife; the supporting cast includes Spencer Treat Clark and Joey Perillo(n)</desc>

Astoundingly, David is not only alive, he hardly seems to have been touched. As David wonders what has happened to him and why he was able to walk away, he encounters a mysterious stranger, Elijah Prince (Samuel L. Jackson), who explains to David that there are a certain number of people who are "unbreakable" -- they have remarkable endurance and courage, a predisposition toward dangerous behavior, and feel invincible but also have strange premonitions of terrible events. Is David "unbreakable"? And if he is, what are the physical and psychological ramifications of this knowledge? Unbreakable also stars Robin Wright-Penn as Audrey, David's wife; the supporting cast includes Spencer Treat Clark and Joey Perillo(n)</desc>

By day, Po works faithfully in his family's noodle shop, but by night he dreams of becoming a true master of the martial arts. Now an ancient prophecy has come to pass, and Po realizes that he is the only one who can save his people from certain destruction. With time running short and malevolent snow leopard Tai Lung (Ian McShane ) closing in, Furious Five legends Tigress (Jolie), Crane (David Cross ), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu), Monkey (Chan), and their wise sensei, Master Shifu (Hoffman), all draw on their vast knowledge of fighting skills in order to transform a lumbering panda bear into a lethal fighting machine. Now, if the noble Po can master the martial arts and somehow transform his greatest weaknesses into his greatest strengths, he will fulfill his destiny as the hero who saved his people during their darkest hour(n)</desc>

The company vice president, Rose is so impressed by her resume that she hires her on the spot as her executive assistant. Her deception looks to be working out great -- Sue Ellen manages to hold off the office lady killer, avoids exposure by the embittered receptionist, borrows money from the company's petty cash box for household incidentals, and continues her relationship with restaurant employee Bryan (Josh Charles). But suddenly, the clothing firm is set to go under, and Sue Ellen must use her teen fashion sense to save the company and her job . . . and she has to get the rest of the brood involved.

    <title lang="en">Ella Enchanted</title>
    <desc lang="en">Adapted from author Gail Carson Levine's award-winning children's book of the same name, the Miramax-financed modern fantasy Ella Enchanted is directed by Tommy O'Haver and stars The Princess Diaries alumna Anne Hathaway. Ella (Hathaway) lives in a magical world in which each child, at the moment of their birth, is given a virtuous "gift" from a fairy godmother. Ella's so-called gift, however, is obedience. This birthright proves itself to be quite the curse once Ella finds herself in the hands of several unscrupulous characters whom she quite literally cannot disobey. Determined to gain control of her life and decisions, Ella sets off on a journey she hopes will end with the lifting of the curse in question. The path, however, isn't easy -- Ella must outwit a slew of unpleasant magical creatures ranging from ogres to talking books with evil plots. Though perilous, Ella's adventures turn out to be necessary obstacles in the path toward finding herself, and maybe even true love along the way. Ella Enchanted also features Cary Elwes, who has starred in a fantasy feature himself (the widely acclaimed The Princess Bride), Hugh Dancy, and Patrick Bergin, among others(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Save Money - Lose Weight.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">New series. As more people head to the high street rather than the GP in search of medical remedies, The Money Saving Good Health Show asks whether a price can be put on good health. Sian Williams investigate which products on the supermarket shelves are worth it, and Dr Ranj Singh tests a range of shop-bought cures, fads and remedies. The first edition is an hour-long diet special, in which six overweight volunteers are put through different off-the-shelf diets for 28 diets. But it's not just about who shifts the most weight - it's also about saving money, so the show will reveal how much each diet costs for every pound of weight they lose.(n)</desc>

This time it's the perfectly preserved remains of a middle-aged man found in a suitcase in the silt of a London river. As the detectives begin the complicated task of trying to identify the victim, four unconnected people go about their business - Brighton-based lawyer Colin Osborne, paediatric nurse Marion Kelsey, teacher Sara Mahmoud and respected police officer Tessa Nixon - unaware they are about to be dragged into the investigation. Nicola Walker and Sanjeev Bhaskar star, with Mark Bonnar, Lorraine Ashbourne, Charlie Condou and Wendy Craig.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Drama detailing the stories of the people of London during the Great Fire of 1666. Widower and single father Thomas Farriner is the king's baker, currently providing the Navy with bread and biscuits from his Pudding Lane bakery. His sister-in-law Sarah often helps out at the shop - a distraction from the fact her wayward husband (Thomas's brother) has been missing at sea for months now. Thomas is dismayed to learn from Navy official Samuel Pepys that it's unlikely he'll be paid for his latest job, owing to the expense of the war against the Dutch. However, he instead sends the baker away with a letter that could be the key to Sarah's closure. Meanwhile, in the palace of Whitehall, the king attends a stately dance, where an attempt on his life is foiled. Later, Thomas returns to find the bakery ablaze, with his two daughters asleep upstairs. Starring Andrew Buchan, Rose Leslie and Jack Huston.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Caroline Quentin meets a couple trying to convert Sandford House near Dundee into a family home. Designed by architect MH Baillie Scott, a member of the Arts and Crafts movement, the property was built in 1902 as a family home, and spent several years being used as a hotel before falling into disrepair. Its new owners first knew the building as their local pub and are determined to save it, but the restoration puts a severe strain on their finances. Meanwhile, researchers discover the property has an unexpected link to Queen Victoria.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Bounty hunter John "The Hangman" Ruth (Kurt Russell) and his dangerous prisoner Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) encounter a treacherous blizzard en route to her sentencing in Wyoming. During their stagecoach ride they come across another bounty hunter, Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson), and former Confederate rebel leader Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins). Seeking refuge from the weather, the group chart a course for a mountain cabin to wait out the storm. There, they meet four other traveling strangers (Tim Roth, Demián Bichir, Michael Madsen, and Bruce Dern) with whom they must share the stuffy confines until the end of the blizzard. Tensions eventually boil over as each individual has his or her own agenda in this inventive Western, which is set in the aftermath of the American Civil War and written and directed by Quentin Tarantino(n)</desc>

Hughley, Bernie Mac, and Cedric The Entertainer -- joined forces for a concert tour that became one of the top money-earning attractions of recent years, consistently selling out 10,000 to 15,000 seat arenas from coast to coast. The Original Kings of Comedy captures the tour's rough and raunchy humor on film. The concert documentary was shot in February of 2000 during a two-night stand in Charlotte, North Carolina (which was the site of the tour's first date three years earlier). Spike Lee served as director(n)</desc>

The days are ticking down to the end of the bomb squad's tour, but their role puts the team in harm's way around the clock.

The Hurt Locker provides a tense glimpse into the lives of these extraordinary men, and also probes the various psychologies of people whose job could kill them at any moment, as well as - briefly - exploring how they cope once away from their adrenaline-soaked vocation(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Shadow Zone: The Undead Express</title>
    <desc lang="en">A horror semi-parody targeted at the young adult market that ravenously gobbles up horror books like R.L. Stine's Goosebumps series, this made-for-TV vampire tale stars Chauncey Leopardi as Zach, a teenage rebel with a flair for telling ghost stories, who stumbles on an underground cabal of vampires when he takes a fateful ride on a New York subway. The vampire's leader, Valentine (Ron Silver), proposes a deal to young Zach, offering him safe passage to the world above, thus enabling the trapped vampire -- who can only mingle with humanity through the willing assistance of an innocent youth -- to reach the surface as well. Our young hero balks at this idea and escapes to the surface with a wild story for his skeptical pals, who shun him until one of their number is kidnapped by the undead subway dwellers in exchange for Zach's cooperation. Though atmospherically photographed, this low-budget production is a bit too corny to provide either laughs or chills, and it suffers further from lethargic pacing(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Independent filmmaker Chris Kentis directs the dramatic thriller Open Water, based on a true story. Susan (Blanchard Ryan) and Daniel (Daniel Travis) are a busy married couple on an island vacation. They board a vessel called the Reef Explorer with a group of other scuba divers, traveling 15 miles out to sea. Since they are certified to dive in open waters, the couple breaks off from the group to go exploring. The Reef Explorer accidentally leaves without a proper head count, leaving them stranded in shark-infested waters. Kentis and producer wife Laura Lau did all the filming themselves in the actual ocean without extraneous special effects, while the actors wore special steel-mesh under their wetsuits in the scenes where actual sharks were involved. Open Water was shown at the Sundance Film Festival in 2004 as part of the American Spectrum competition(n)</desc>

Jim (Jason Biggs) is about to marry Michelle, while his crazy friends, Finch, Stifler and Kevin, still have their hormones somewhat worked up. Apart from rushing to make all the arrangements for the wedding, Jim must strive to gain the approval of his parents-in-law, and, to make matters worse, he has to battle with the restrictions of his grandmother, who is against the wedding because Michelle is not Jewish. In addition, the arrival of Cadence, the bride's youngest sister, completely upsets the situation. Finch and Stifler fall in love with her and start a heated dispute, where one of them is the rebel, and the other, prince charming. Of course, a crazy stag party could not be left out. The director of this film, Jesse Dylan, is Bob Dylan's son(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">What goes on backstage at a high-school musical turns out to be more exciting than what is in front of the footlights in this comedy-drama from director Marc Evans. It's 1976, and Vivienne (Minnie Driver) is a music teacher at a high school in a working-class suburb of Swansea, Wales. Vivienne has been put in charge of directing the school's end-of-season musical, and she's chosen an unusual and ambitious project -- an adaptation of William Shakespeare's +The Tempest with a score assembled from contemporary rock tunes. Swansea isn't exactly a haven for the arts, and Vivienne has a hard time keeping her cast interested in rehearsals as warm weather arrives and the end of the school year looms. However, there are exceptions -- Davey (Aneurin Barnard) is excited that he gets to play love scenes as Ferdinand with the play's Miranda, a girl named Stella (Danielle Branch) who has stolen his heart despite her reputation. However, as Davey becomes infatuated with Vivienne, things become increasingly complicated for her, especially after she persuades several members of the faculty to join the cast. Hunky Dory includes performances of period-appropriate tunes from a number of British rock acts, including David Bowie, Electric Light Orchestra, and Nick Drake(n)</desc>

Now the town drunk and the object of ridicule, Denton dreams of the day that he will regain his skills with a sixgun. That day comes sooner than expected, thanks to a travelling peddler named Henry J. Fate (Malcolm Atterbury) -- but there's a bizarre price tag attached. Written by Rod Serling, this Twilight Zone episode features an impressive cast of future TV-series stars, including Martin Landau as town bully Hotaling, Doug McClure as punkish fast gun Pete Grant, and Jeanne Cooper as faded saloon girl Liz. Incidentally, this dramatic episode was originally intended as a comic story titled "You Too Can Be a Fast Gun," with a timid schoolteacher unexpectedly gaining renown as a gunfighter(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">The New Exhibit</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The New Exhibit. First telecast April 4, 1963, this grim 60-minute Twilight Zone installment would seem to be more suited to Alfred Hitchcock Presents or Thriller. Martin Balsam stars as Martin Senescu, curator of a "chamber of horrors" wax museum. Upon learning that the museum is to be demolished, Martin takes his favorite wax statues -- those of Jack the Ripper, Henri "Bluebeard" Landru, and ax murderer Albert W. Hicks -- to his home, much to the dismay of his wife Emma (Maggie Mahoney). Not long afterward, two brutal murders take place -- and the evidence leads Martin to conclude that the culprits were his beloved wax figures. Though credited to Charles Beaumont, "The New Exhibit" was actually scripted by longtime Beaumont collaborator Jerry Sohl(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Mr. Denton on Doomsday. First telcast October 16, 1959, this episode stars Dan Duryea as Al Denton, a once-legendary gunslinger fallen on hard times. Now the town drunk and the object of ridicule, Denton dreams of the day that he will regain his skills with a sixgun. That day comes sooner than expected, thanks to a travelling peddler named Henry J. Fate (Malcolm Atterbury) -- but there's a bizarre price tag attached. Written by Rod Serling, this Twilight Zone episode features an impressive cast of future TV-series stars, including Martin Landau as town bully Hotaling, Doug McClure as punkish fast gun Pete Grant, and Jeanne Cooper as faded saloon girl Liz. Incidentally, this dramatic episode was originally intended as a comic story titled "You Too Can Be a Fast Gun," with a timid schoolteacher unexpectedly gaining renown as a gunfighter(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Pilot. April 5, 1987, was the historic day upon which the Fox network launched its first prime-time lineup with the highly controversial -- and incredibly successful -- situation comedy Married... With Children. The pilot episode wastes no time introducing the delightfully dysfunctional Bundy family of Chicago: Boorish shoe salesman Al Bundy (Ed O'Neill), his lazy, sex-obsessed wife Peg (Katey Sagal), and their worthless children, underachieving 11-year-old Bud (David Faustino) and promiscuous 15-year-old Kelly (Christina Applegate). In the opener, Peg insists that Al try to make friends with the Bundys' new next-door neighbors, simperingly sweet newlyweds Steve and Marcy Rhodes (David Garrison, Amanda Bearse) -- and in the process nearly destroy the young couple's marriage before it gets into first gear. Also on hand is Al's swinging-bachelor co-worker Luke Ventura (Ritch Shydner)(n)</desc>
