    <desc lang="en">Santa's black-sheep brother gets a much-needed shot at redemption in this holiday comedy reuniting actor Vince Vaughn and director David Dobkin (Clay Pigeons, Wedding Crashers). It's not easy being the brother of a benevolent and beloved saint, and no one knows that better than Fred Claus (Vaughn). After struggling for years to live up to the example set by his younger sibling Nicholas (Paul Giamatti), Fred has finally given up. These days Fred is working as a repo man taken to stealing the items he repossesses, and his shady tactics have just landed him in jail. While Mrs. Claus vehemently insists that Fred fend for himself, Nicholas refuses to sit idly by as his brother rots in jail and agrees to set bail if Fred will repay the debt by coming to the North Pole and help make toys for the upcoming Christmas season. But Fred isn't nearly as productive as your average elf, and he's got quite an attitude to boot. With Christmas fast approaching and Fred threatening to sideline Nicholas' entire finely tuned operation, the brother that always struggled to get out from under his sibling's substantial shadow finds out just how far the patience of a saint can be pushed before jolly old Santa reaches his breaking point(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">One of the first projects of syndicated TV producer Steve Rotfield, the weekly half-hour Wild About Animals was hosted by actress Mariette Hartley. The series cast its spotlight on rare animals, unique to specific regions of the United States. Regular weekly features included "K9 Cops and Animal Heroes," "Celebrity Owners," and "Animal Bloopers." First telecast in the fall of 1995, Wild About Animals was still flourishing at the end of the 20th century, by which time it was being shown in tandem with two other Rotfield efforts, The Lighter Side of Sports and Awesome Adventures, in most local markets(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Arrival</title>
    <desc lang="en">They have been saying for years that the Greenhouse Effect is going to destroy the planet. For years humans have blamed themselves for spewing climate-changing gasses into our fragile atmosphere. But are we as guilty as we think we are or are there more sinister forces at work? Paying tribute to an old-fashioned '50s style paranoid (the aliens have come to take over the planet) sci-fi low-budget thriller, this film gives a chilling answer to that question. It begins with the scene of a young woman picking poppies in a verdant field. She is obviously puzzled and as the camera pulls away it becomes clear why. The story then jumps to a California observatory where nerdish radio telescope operator Zane Ziminski is suddenly jarred from the boredom of monitoring random space noises by a strangely regular series of unearthly blips that he is convinced come from an alien galaxy and for some reason are being deliberately beamed to Earth. Excitedly he takes the recorded evidence to his boss, who promptly fires him. Convinced that the aliens were transmitting messages to aliens already on our planet, Ziminski quickly builds a make-shift radio telescope and high tech computer system in his garage so he can pinpoit the destination of the singles. This leads him to an isolated Mexican village where he and another scientist (the lady from the poppy field), who has drawn similar conclusions, team up and go alien-hunting. They don't hunt long, for the villagers turn out to be mighty strange people. From there it is only a short time before they find the underground alien lair where they learn that the invaders' home planet is dying and that they are planning to "terraform" the Earth in preparation of colonizing it. Part of the process involves deliberately accelerating the Greenhouse effect. The special effects are well-done and refreshingly, they are not overpowering(n)</desc>

Documentary telling the full story of World War II with the aid of rare and unseen archive footage, recently released official documents, modern colourisation techniques, state-of-the-art satellite-delivered terrain mapping and graphics. In the run-up to September 1939, political and economic chaos in the aftermath of World War I allowed Hitler in Germany, Mussolini in Italy and ultra-nationalists in imperial Japan to seize absolute power.

Despite superior men and equipment, France and England had not learned the lessons of the Polish defeat and were utterly at a loss how to counter such attacks. (Followed by News)(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato present an uncompromising portrait of controversial American photographer Robert Mapplethorpe. Based in New York, Mapplethorpe continually challenged the limits of acceptability via large-scale, highly stylised portraits of typically taboo subjects. His tendency to flirt with obscenity dominated his work until his death in 1989, and as the images he produced gained notoriety, he was posthumously denounced by conservative US senator Jesse Helms, who urged Congressmen to `look at the pictures' he had produced in his lifetime and decide for themselves whether they were suitable for public consumption. Here, Bailey and Barbato explain how Mapplethorpe's artistic flair was not only fuelled by what is now considered to be his genius eye, but also by his insatiable desire for celebrity.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">After almost eight weeks, Emma Willis reveals the result of the public vote to choose the winner of Big Brother 2017. Whittling them down one by one, Emma leads the runners-up quickly through the best and worst of their time on Big Brother, until there is only one remaining. She chats to the winner about life in the house, why they think they have won and how it feels to be back in the outside world. There'll also be a roll-call of all the evictees from the series and a speedy look at what the housemates got up to yesterday. And fans needn't worry - the normal series may be over for another year, but Celebrity Big Brother promises to return soon.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A low-level pot dealer poses as a family man in order to pay back a debt to his supplier in this comedy starring Saturday Night Live alumni Jason Sudeikis. If you're a soccer mom in search of some reefer, David Burke (Sudeikis) is just the man to talk to. He certainly isn't the biggest dealer in town, but he's discreet, and aims to please. When David attempts to perform a good deed and gets robbed in the process, however, his supplier Brad (Ed Helms) is none too happy. Now, in order to pay Brad back before the hammer drops, David must retrieve a big drug shipment from Mexico and sneak back across the border undetected. It's a risky job for sure, but with the help of a few neighbors David might just pull it off. With sardonic stripper Rose (Jennifer Aniston) assuming the role of housewife, teenage misfit Kenny (Will Poulter) posing as the awkward son, and rebellious Casey (Emma Roberts) filling in as his sister, David slips on some khakis, and starts heading south. Meanwhile, as David tries to convince himself that the border patrol wouldn't give a second glance at such a typical suburban family, the shipment -- and the stakes -- both prove greater than anticipated. Nick Offerman, Kathryn Hahn, and Ken Marino co-star(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Jumanji</title>
    <desc lang="en">Computer-generated action comes fast and furious in this special-effects driven fantasy adventure. The adventure begins in 1969 when little Alan Parish, lonely, picked on, and largely ignored by his wealthy father, a shoe manufacturer in a picturesque New England town, explores a construction site and unearths a mysterious, ornate box with the name Jumanji upon it. He takes it home to his big empty mansion and sees that it is some sort of game. His father returns home and informs the poor boy, who had been beaten up earlier in the day, that he has been enrolled in a prestigious boarding school. A fight ensues just before his parents go out for the evening. Alone and frustrated, Alan and his friend Sarah, open the box and begin playing the strange game. As soon as they choose their pieces and set them upon the board, the pieces become stuck. Sarah rolls the dice and her piece moves by itself. As it moves the great crystal in the center of the game board begins to swirl and a cryptic message appears. Suddenly the room is filled with giant African bats. Alan rolls next and finds himself encircled in a swirling vortex of smoke and he is then literally sucked into the game. Nothing the terrified Sarah does can get him back, so she flees. Over twenty years pass and a young woman and two children, her orphaned niece and nephew, are seen moving into the now-ramshackle Parrish manse. There the children hear a great drumming sound in the attic. Curious, they creep in and find Jumanji. They begin to play the game and suddenly find themselves beset by deadly blood-sucking mosquitoes, maliciously mischievous monkeys, man-eating plants, and a lion. Then long-lost, but now full-grown, Alan suddenly appears pursued by an ruthless 18th-century hunter. Banished by the game to live alone in the jungle all these years, Alan has become a crazed wild man. It is he who explains the sinister game that must be completed for the horror to end. After recruiting a reluctant and frightened grown-up Sarah, the hapless players unleash upon themselves and their town, untold horrors, including a stampeding heard of African animals, crocodiles, and a flood(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Herbert Ross' musical romance stars Kevin Bacon as Ren McCormack, a teenager who moves from Chicago to a small town where, to his horror, he discovers rock music and dancing are outlawed at the behest of preacher Shaw Moore, who blames the death of his daughter on the devil's music. And to complicate matters, Ren falls for Moore's surviving daughter Ariel who is not as innocent as she seems. As Ren tries to persuade Moore that rock music isn't the root of all evil, a confrontation with both his daughter and the more bigoted members of his congregation give him food for thought in this classic feel-good film.

    <title lang="en">Machine Gun Preacher</title>
    <desc lang="en">Gerard Butler stars in Marc Forster's violent, fact-based drama about a substance-addicted criminal who finds God and relocates to Sudan to offer his own idiosyncratic brand of Christian charity. The film initially portrays Sam Childers as being a far from nice man: a misogynistic biker whose life is steeped in crime, narcotics and violence, and who quickly returns to armed robbery almost as soon as he's released from jail. But while he was inside, his wife Lynn found Jesus, and, after Sam gets stabbed, she urges him to join her at church. Sam subsequently has his own Damascene moment and starts life afresh, founding his own (legitimate) construction company. Before long he has also built his own church. But it's only after a trip to Sudan, where he witnesses the devastation wrought by the marauding Lord's Resistance Army, that he truly becomes driven. Relocating to the African country, he sets up a faith-based centre to care for victims of the LRA's violence and rape. And also takes up arms to literally fight the good fight... Also starring Michael Shannon(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">When scientists unlock the secret to immortality, time becomes the new currency and one desperate man comes under attack from a mysterious group known only as the "Time Keepers." In the not-too-distant future, scientists have discovered a way to turn off the aging gene. As the threat of overpopulation looms over society, money becomes a thing of the past. Now, assets are measured in time; those with the most time also possess the most power. Meanwhile, the lower classes are forced to barter with the new elite if they want to live forever. Suddenly a young commoner stumbles across a treasure chest of time. With the "Time Keepers" in hot pursuit, however, he may never get a chance to use it. Justin Timberlake, Amanda Seyfried, and Olivia Wilde star in this sci-fi thriller from writer/director Andrew Niccol (Gattaca, Lord of War)(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Guests from Loughborough eat a diet of convenience food that is not only unwholesome, it is also very expensive. Mum Lisa is aware she has to make her family more healthy, but is going about it the wrong way, buying into costly `superfoods' rather than good old-fashioned fruit and veg. Can Gregg and Chris help the Guests bring more variety to their plates - and in turn, knock a whopping 50 per cent off their shopping bill? Along the way, they also investigate how canned fish compares to fresh and which oil is best for cooking, as well as the diet cons to watch out for.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Six new cooks take on two challenges. The first three begin with a Skills Test set by Marcus Wareing.

Can Gregg and Chris help the Guests bring more variety to their plates - and in turn, knock a whopping 50 per cent off their shopping bill?

Gwyneth Paltrow once more employs her faultless English accent, playing aristocratic Viola de Lesseps, who is shortly to be married off but yearns to slum it as an actor. Disguising herself as a boy in order to be allowed on stage, Viola becomes Will's muse, and the more familiar tale of Romeo and Juliet begins to take shape as the couple fall passionately in love. The film is littered with knowing lines and energetically supported by a stellar cast, including Judy Dench as Queen Elizabeth - a cameo performance which earned her one of the movie's seven Oscars(n)</desc>

But the host of the show, Prem Kumar is convinced he's cheating and hands him over to the police to beat the truth out of him.

Along the way, Jamal falls in love with Latika, an orphaned girl, but the pair become separated. Meanwhile his brother Salim takes the path of violence as a gangster's gunman.

Gwyneth Paltrow once more employs her faultless English accent, playing aristocratic Viola de Lesseps, who is shortly to be married off but yearns to slum it as an actor. Disguising herself as a boy in order to be allowed on stage, Viola becomes Will's muse, and the more familiar tale of Romeo and Juliet begins to take shape as the couple fall passionately in love. The film is littered with knowing lines and energetically supported by a stellar cast, including Judy Dench as Queen Elizabeth - a cameo performance which earned her one of the movie's seven Oscars(n)</desc>

In her efforts to gain re-entry into Local 706 of the Hair and Makeup Guild, the heavily wrinkled Ruby crosses paths with two other Ullman creations, Russian émigré Svetlana and actress Pepper Kane, a black woman trying to pass as white (not surprisingly, both ladies are prime targets for Ruby's unending stream of ethnic slurs). Somehow or other, Ruby's return to her days of glory also brings her in contact with such real-life popular culture icons as Debbie Reynolds, Barbara Bain, Cheech Marin, Rose Marie, Jane Kaczmarek, and former Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In producer George Schlatter(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A down-on-his luck auteur gets one more chance at the big time -- provided his neuroses don't swallow him whole -- in Woody Allen's 33rd feature release, Hollywood Ending. Allen plays Val Waxman, a one-time cinematic genius who's resorted to taking advertisement work to pay the bills for himself and his airhead live-in girlfriend, Lori (Debra Messing). Val finds his luck is about to change, however, when he receives the script for The City Never Sleeps, a period noir set against the backdrop of 1940s New York City. It seems his ex-wife, Ellie (Tea Leoni), now an executive at Galaxy Pictures, has been pulling for him to direct the picture, claiming he's the only man who can do justice to the script. She even manages to convince her boyfriend, Hal (Treat Williams), Galaxy's high-powered studio head, to take a chance on Val's "unique vision." Just when the cameras are ready to roll, however, Val finds that unique vision in jeopardy -- literally -- as he's struck with a psychosomatic case of blindness. When physicians and psychiatrists fail to cure him, Val contrives a scheme to forge ahead with the picture, for fear of blowing his one last chance at greatness.

Mike (Mos Def) is an employee at Be Kind Rewind, a modest mom and pop video store that is owned by Mr. Fletcher (Danny Glover). Mike's best friend Jerry (Jack Black) works in an auto garage/junkyard directly adjacent to a local power plant. Lately Jerry has become increasingly paranoid about the effects that the power plant is having on his health. Convinced that he has developed a brain tumor from working in such close proximity to the power plant, Jerry attempts to sabotage the plant. Unfortunately for Jerry, his brain is magnetized in the process. The next time Jerry goes to visit Mike at Be Kind Rewind, the powerful magnetization emanating from his brain erases every videotape in the store. Now the only way for Mike and Jerry to be sure that Be Kind Rewind stays in business is to remake every film on the shelves before the customers notice. But when word gets out that Mike and Jerry have remade such Hollywood classics as Back to the Future, Robocop, The Lion King, and Rush Hour without permission, the store is threatened with copyright violations and forced to close its doors. In the aftermath of the closing, Mr. Fletcher and his employees discover just how loyal their customers really are when the entire neighborhood pools their resources to transform the junkyard into a legitimate movie studio and produce an entirely original film detailing the incredible adventures of a local jazz legend(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Good Guy</title>
    <desc lang="en">After executive producing the acclaimed documentary Manda Bala and the J.M. Coetzee adaptation Disgrace, Julio DePietro makes his feature debut as a writer-director with The Good Guy, a drama about ambitious young Wall Streeters fighting each other -- and sometimes their own decent nature -- to get ahead in the world. Our narrator, Tommy (Scott Porter of TV's Friday Night Lights), is young, clever, charming, and attractive. He's got a smart, pretty girlfriend, Beth (Alexis Bledel of Gilmore Girls), an urban conservationist. He's also very good at his investment broker job, impressing his ruthless, cynical boss, Cash (erstwhile "Brat Pack" member Andrew McCarthy). When a key member of Tommy's sales team suddenly leaves for a competitor, Tommy needs to fill his spot quickly, and takes a chance on the bumbling Daniel (Bryan Greenberg, Bride Wars), a former Marine and computer geek who seems a bit naïve about high finance and a bit nervous around women. Tommy takes Daniel under his wing, showing him how to dress, where to socialize, and how to charm attractive women. Their relationship is threatened when Daniel begins spending more time with Beth, joining her book club, and becoming her confidant. Tommy begins to question his decision to share his wisdom with Daniel, while Daniel is forced to decide what success really means to him, and where his loyalties lie. The Good Guy also stars Anna Chlumsky (In the Loop) and Aaron Yoo (Disturbia). The film had its world premiere at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival(n)</desc>

After stumbling across a human camp that's under attack by a pride of sabre-toothed tigers and narrowly saving a baby, they're joined by Diego, a sabretooth who convinces them he can help return the child by tracking the humans. However, he's actually a member of the same pride - and is plotting to guide them into an ambush. Can Manny and Sid find the baby's father and avoid the frozen weather?

    <desc lang="en">Devastated upon receiving the news that her husband has been killed in a tragic car accident, a woman wakes up to find him still very much alive as she begins to slip into a confusing world where the past and the future become increasingly difficult to distinguish. Linda Hanson (Sandra Bullock) was an average housewife with a loving family, but when a policeman comes knocking on her door with news that her husband, Jim (Julian McMahon), was involved in a fatal car accident, Linda's world slowly begins to unravel. While her grief is at first overwhelming, Linda assumes that the whole thing was nothing more than a vivid dream when she wakes to find her family still very much intact. With each passing day, however, Linda's reality shifts and her circumstances grow increasingly surreal; one day Jim is dead and the next he is right there by her side. As her investigation leaves her convinced that her husband's death wasn't a dream and that her picture-perfect life may not have been quite as flawless as she thought, Linda embarks on a mind-bending journey to prevent her grim premonition from becoming a reality. Now, in order to save the man she loves, Linda will have to piece together a perplexing mystery that seems to span two separate planes of reality(n)</desc>

Though she had no concept of how far they would go, Freda had faith in The Beatles from the beginning, and The Beatles had faith in her. History notes that The Beatles were together for 10 years, but Freda worked for them for 11. Many people came in and out of the band's circle as they grew to international stardom, but Freda remained a staple because of her unfaltering loyalty and dedication. As the Beatles' devoted secretary and friend, Freda was there as history unfolded; she witnessed the evolution - advances and setbacks, breakthroughs and challenges - of one of the greatest bands in history. In Good Ol' Freda, Freda tells her story for the first time in 50 years. One of few documentaries with the support of the living Beatles and featuring original Beatles music, the film offers an insider perspective on the beloved band that changed the world of music(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Caveman's Valentine</title>
    <desc lang="en">A man struggles back from madness to avenge the death of someone he knew in an intelligent thriller based on the acclaimed novel by George Dawes Green. Romulus Ledbetter (Samuel L. Jackson) once had a career as an acclaimed concert pianist, a position at the Juilliard School of Music, and a loving wife and children. But Ledbetter's life has been devastated by paranoid schizophrenia; now homeless, Ledbetter wanders the streets of New York City as he rails against Cornelius Gould Stuyvesant, a man whom he believes controls all the evil in the world while following his movements from a perch atop the Chrysler Building. Most nights, Ledbetter takes shelter in a cave in Central Park, earning him the nickname "the Caveman." One morning, Ledbetter discovers a frozen corpse caught in the branches of a tree near his cave; the body is that of Scotty (Sean MacMahaon), a homeless drug addict who was close friends with his pal Matthew (Rodney Eastman). Ledbetter is determined to get justice for Scotty, and he's also eager to prove himself to his daughter Lulu (Aunjanue Ellis), now a New York City police officer. While Ledbetter is at first convinced that his nemesis Stuyvesant is responsible for Scotty's death, in time he focuses on another suspect: David Leppenraub (Colm Feore), a famous photographer known for his controversial erotic images of young men, who occasionally hired Scotty as a model. As Ledbetter attempts to investigate Leppenraub's possible role in the murder, he soon gains an unexpected ally -- Moira (Ann Magnuson), a noted sculptor and Leppenraub's sister. The Caveman's Valentine marked the major-studio debut for director Kasi Lemmons, who made an impressive debut in 1997 with the independent drama Eve's Bayou(n)</desc>

Now the town drunk and the object of ridicule, Denton dreams of the day that he will regain his skills with a sixgun. That day comes sooner than expected, thanks to a travelling peddler named Henry J. Fate (Malcolm Atterbury) -- but there's a bizarre price tag attached. Written by Rod Serling, this Twilight Zone episode features an impressive cast of future TV-series stars, including Martin Landau as town bully Hotaling, Doug McClure as punkish fast gun Pete Grant, and Jeanne Cooper as faded saloon girl Liz. Incidentally, this dramatic episode was originally intended as a comic story titled "You Too Can Be a Fast Gun," with a timid schoolteacher unexpectedly gaining renown as a gunfighter(n)</desc>
