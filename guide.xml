    <title lang="en">Waterworld</title>
    <desc lang="en">This epic sci-fi actioner is set 200 years in the future. The polar ice caps have melted, flooding the continents and creating a giant ocean. People are few and far between, living as sailors or on rickety atolls made from scrap metal; in this time, dry land is considered a myth and dirt and water have become the most valuable currency. The film begins as a mysterious Mariner aboard his ingenious trimaran urinates carefully into a small jar. He then pours the golden liquid into a filtration device that purifies it and makes it drinkable. The Mariner is self sufficient and eschews humanity, except for occasional stops for supplies. He is different from other humans in that he has developed functional gills and has webbed feet. Such a mutation makes him a pariah. He cruises into a rusty atoll and tries to exchange dirt for supplies. The half-crazy people within the fortress end up putting him in a cage and planning to recycle him in a bubbling vat of green effluvium. Just before he is to die, the fortress is attacked by a flotilla of Smokers (tobacco addicted sea bikers) led by the bald, one-eyed and crazy Deacon who has come to search for a little girl with a strange tattoo on her back that is said to be a map leading to dry land. The girl and her mother escape with the reluctant Mariner. Eventually Deacon and the Smokers capture the girl and it is up to the fishy stranger to save her from their hulking lair (which turns out to be the notorious wreck of the Exxon Valdez)(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Midnight Cowboy</title>
    <desc lang="en">Joe Buck (John Voight) is the naive Texas dishwasher who leaves his tiny town for a life as a male prostitute in New York City. He quits his job and gets on a northbound bus. The rural rube encounters the brassy Cass (Sylvia Miles) and believes he has his first paying customer, but the Jewish princess brings out the crying towel in mock humiliation. Joe ends up giving her money for cab fare as his experience foreshadows other demoralizing events. He meets local street hustler Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) who relieves Joe of some more cash and sends him to the demented religious fanatic O'Daniel (John McGiver). Joe is horrified to learn O'Daniel is not a pimp and flees his seedy apartment. Wandering the cold, lonely streets, Joe is amazed that a dead man on the sidewalk draws no attention or interest from the locals. He meets up with the conniving Ratso and threatens to kill him if he doesn't return the money. Ratso gives Joe a place to stay in a condemned apartment building where the two scrounge for survival as winter approaches. Joe is reduced to allowing himself to be used for homosexual sex and a young college student fails to pay for his services. Ratso and Joe attend a trendy, drug soaked Manhattan party where he meets the stoned Shirley (Brenda Vaccaro), who pays Joe double the asking price for his sexual services. Ratso is already a cripple who finds his health worsening with the arrival of winter. Joe returns Ratso's kindness by vowing to take the ailing petty thief to Miami. While Ratso dreams of sun, fun and bikini clad women, Joe encounters a simpering, middle-aged homosexual from Chicago in town for a convention. He asks the man for money but is far short of the amount needed for two-one way trips to Florida on the Greyhound bus. Joe knocks out the man's dentures and sticks telephone receiver down the man's throat. By now Ratso is convinced he will be preyed upon in the mean streets of New York if he doesn't get to warm weather soon. Midnight Cowboy won the Oscar for Best Picture, Best screenplay (Waldo Salt) and Best Director (John Schlesinger). Hoffman, Voight, and Miles were nominated for their performances. Fred Neil's song "Everybody's Talking" was a smash for Nillson. Warren Zevon wrote a song, and The Group and Elephant's Memory also contributed to the memorable soundtrack. The film was rated X at the time and it the only X rated feature to win the Academy Award(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Unstoppable</title>
    <desc lang="en">Denzel Washington and Chris Pine star in this intense action thriller, the final work to be directed by the late Tony Scott. Veteran railroad employee Frank Barnes has his quarrels with the young, new guy on the job, Will Colson - largely because the younger man is about to replace him. But the two must join forces and race against time when an enormous runaway train carrying toxic chemicals heads their way. If its terminal destination in a city wasn't bad enough, the lethal behemoth is also on the same line as another train, aboard which are 150 children who are returning from a school trip. When the railroad company's chairman refuses to take action for financial reasons, Frank takes it upon himself to save the day, despite the seemingly suicidal nature of the mission and the devastating consequences it's likely to have for his loved ones. Will opposes Frank's ridiculously dangerous idea, but joins him anyway. Can the two men patch up their differences and save the day? In addition to the nail-biting action, the score beautifully highlights the suspense, and earned the film a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Sound Editing(n)</desc>

Ultimately, of course, Charles finds ample reason to shiver in his boots, but not before his colleagues have dealt with such contigencies as an explosion, a severe case of hypothermia--and a marathon screening of the Sonja Henie skating epic Sun Valley Serenade(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Unstoppable</title>
    <desc lang="en">Denzel Washington and Chris Pine star in this intense action thriller, the final work to be directed by the late Tony Scott. Veteran railroad employee Frank Barnes has his quarrels with the young, new guy on the job, Will Colson - largely because the younger man is about to replace him. But the two must join forces and race against time when an enormous runaway train carrying toxic chemicals heads their way. If its terminal destination in a city wasn't bad enough, the lethal behemoth is also on the same line as another train, aboard which are 150 children who are returning from a school trip. When the railroad company's chairman refuses to take action for financial reasons, Frank takes it upon himself to save the day, despite the seemingly suicidal nature of the mission and the devastating consequences it's likely to have for his loved ones. Will opposes Frank's ridiculously dangerous idea, but joins him anyway. Can the two men patch up their differences and save the day? In addition to the nail-biting action, the score beautifully highlights the suspense, and earned the film a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Sound Editing(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Mark Steven Johnson's violent superhero fantasy-morality play stars Ben Affleck as Matt Murdock, a guilt-wracked blind vigilante with a penchant for red leather. During his childhood, an accident involving toxic waste blinded Murdock, but it also enhanced his other senses and gave him a kind of 'radar vision'. The incident was partially caused by his discovery that his father was involved with the Mob. Now, the adult Murdock, spurred partly by Catholic guilt over his role in his father's death, has dedicated this life to fighting crime and protecting the innocent. By day Murdock's a defence lawyer, but by night he dispenses summary justice to criminals who've escaped the courts. Things get complicated when he falls in love with Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner). Not only is she the daughter of a man with connections to New York crime bosses but, unknown to Murdock, she's also a vigilante who's equally keen on figure-hugging leather (black in her case). And when Daredevil is framed for the murder of her father, Elektra swears vengeance on the masked crime-fighter (not realising that he's her lover). Meanwhile, both of them are in mortal danger from the actual killer, a merciless Irish assassin called Bullseye (Colin Farrell)(n)</desc>

People are few and far between, living as sailors or on rickety atolls made from scrap metal; in this time, dry land is considered a myth and dirt and water have become the most valuable currency. The film begins as a mysterious Mariner aboard his ingenious trimaran urinates carefully into a small jar. He then pours the golden liquid into a filtration device that purifies it and makes it drinkable. The Mariner is self sufficient and eschews humanity, except for occasional stops for supplies. He is different from other humans in that he has developed functional gills and has webbed feet. Such a mutation makes him a pariah. He cruises into a rusty atoll and tries to exchange dirt for supplies. The half-crazy people within the fortress end up putting him in a cage and planning to recycle him in a bubbling vat of green effluvium. Just before he is to die, the fortress is attacked by a flotilla of Smokers (tobacco addicted sea bikers) led by the bald, one-eyed and crazy Deacon who has come to search for a little girl with a strange tattoo on her back that is said to be a map leading to dry land. The girl and her mother escape with the reluctant Mariner. Eventually Deacon and the Smokers capture the girl and it is up to the fishy stranger to save her from their hulking lair (which turns out to be the notorious wreck of the Exxon Valdez)(n)</desc>

When Nate Johnson (Cedric the Entertainer) is invited to a big family reunion in Missouri, he sees it as an opportunity to reconnect with his estranged wife and growing children, as well as a chance to show up his wealthier know-it-all brother, Mack (Steve Harvey). Nate takes delivery on an expensive new SUV, persuades his recently separated wife, Dorothy (Vanessa L. Williams), to tag along, and packs up his three kids -- nubile teenager Nikki (Solange Knowles), under-age wannabe rapper D.J. (Bow Wow), and precocious seven-year-old Destiny (Gabby Soleil) -- for what he imagines will be a leisurely drive from Los Angeles to St. Louis. However, between his wary wife, arguing kids, angry police officers, bizarre hitchhikers, bad diner food, and an unfortunate run-in with a cement mixer, getting from point A to point B proves to be just short of a nightmare. Johnson Family Vacation was the first feature film for director Christopher Erskin, who previously distinguished himself directing music videos for the likes of Missy Elliot, TLC, and Boyz II Men(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Boat enthusiast James Strangeways invites Kevin McCloud to survey progress on the construction of his new home, which his architect nephew Ben Hebblethwaite has designed to be as `un-houselike' as possible. James has spent the past 35 years travelling the canals and waterways of Britain, and despite never liking houses, has decided now is the time to put down roots on dry land. Ben hoped a home standing on stilts above a marsh, and incorporating ship-like qualities such as a keel-shaped roof, will be enough to satisfy his boat-mad uncle. However, Ben's contractor goes into liquidation a few months into the project, taking £87,000 of the £300,000 budget, and when James decides to make a few tweaks to the design, alarm-bells begin to ring for the young architect.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Crew</title>
    <desc lang="en">In this dark comedy, a group of retirees wants to save their homes -- but they're not typical senior citizens trying to make the most of their Social Security checks. Four aging former mobsters -- Joey "Bats" Pistella (Burt Reynolds), Bobby Bartellemeo (Richard Dreyfuss), Mike the Brick (Dan Hedaya), and Tony "The Mouth" Donato (Seymour Cassel) -- live in the same rundown Miami apartment complex, the Raj Mahal. New owners hope to clear out the current tenants and replace them with a younger, more lucrative clientele. But the veteran gangsters don't want to move, so to scrape up the extra rent money, they take a job executing the father of a Miami mob boss. They happen to know he's already dead, so all they have to do is make it look like they did the hit. Their problems start when loudmouthed ladies' man Tony tells too much to Ferris (Jennifer Tilly), a stripper, and soon she's talked him into murdering her mother (Lainie Kazan) in exchange for her silence. The Crew also features Carrie-Anne Moss as a detective and Jeremy Piven as a mob kingpin out to avenge his father's death(n)</desc>

Hays Hodges, a comrade-in-arms who owes his life to Childers. Hodges is not the best lawyer in the service, but Childers trusts him as a brother Marine who knows what it's like to risk death under fire. Bound by duty and friendship, Hodges reluctantly takes the case, even as he begins to doubt the man who saved his life in Vietnam three decades ago(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Three Kings</title>
    <desc lang="en">Three stars team up for this unusual look at America's role in the war against Iraq. In 1991, as the Gulf War winds to a close, three American servicemen find themselves happy to have achieved victory but wondering about the ultimate importance of what they've done (especially since Saddam Hussein is still in power). Major Archie Gates (George Clooney) is a decorated Vietnam veteran and special forces officer with two weeks to go before he retires; Sgt. Troy Barlow (Mark Wahlberg) has a new baby at home; and Chief Elgin (Ice Cube) is probably just going to end up back in Detroit. So when one of them comes across a map that seems to point out where Saddam's forces have stashed a large cache of gold they stole from Kuwait, they decide to follow the trail and take some of the war booty for themselves. However, the deeper they journey into Iraq, the more they see of the consequences of America's policies in the Middle East. Although President George Bush and the American military urged Iraqi citizens to rise up against Saddam Hussein, and pledged their support to a people's movement against the leader, Iraqis found that when they took to the streets against Saddam, the United States did not back them up, and the loss of Iraqi lives was fearsome. When Gates, Barlow and Elgin become aware of what's happening, they're torn between their desire to grab the fortune they came for and the demands of their conscience to help the people they came to liberate. Three Kings was directed by David O. Russell and marked a significant change of direction after his dark-humored relationship comedies, Spanking the Monkey and Flirting with Disaster(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Daredevil</title>
    <desc lang="en">Mark Steven Johnson's violent superhero fantasy-morality play stars Ben Affleck as Matt Murdock, a guilt-wracked blind vigilante with a penchant for red leather. During his childhood, an accident involving toxic waste blinded Murdock, but it also enhanced his other senses and gave him a kind of 'radar vision'. The incident was partially caused by his discovery that his father was involved with the Mob. Now, the adult Murdock, spurred partly by Catholic guilt over his role in his father's death, has dedicated this life to fighting crime and protecting the innocent. By day Murdock's a defence lawyer, but by night he dispenses summary justice to criminals who've escaped the courts. Things get complicated when he falls in love with Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner). Not only is she the daughter of a man with connections to New York crime bosses but, unknown to Murdock, she's also a vigilante who's equally keen on figure-hugging leather (black in her case). And when Daredevil is framed for the murder of her father, Elektra swears vengeance on the masked crime-fighter (not realising that he's her lover). Meanwhile, both of them are in mortal danger from the actual killer, a merciless Irish assassin called Bullseye (Colin Farrell)(n)</desc>

Four aging former mobsters -- Joey "Bats" Pistella (Burt Reynolds), Bobby Bartellemeo (Richard Dreyfuss), Mike the Brick (Dan Hedaya), and Tony "The Mouth" Donato (Seymour Cassel) -- live in the same rundown Miami apartment complex, the Raj Mahal. New owners hope to clear out the current tenants and replace them with a younger, more lucrative clientele. But the veteran gangsters don't want to move, so to scrape up the extra rent money, they take a job executing the father of a Miami mob boss. They happen to know he's already dead, so all they have to do is make it look like they did the hit. Their problems start when loudmouthed ladies' man Tony tells too much to Ferris (Jennifer Tilly), a stripper, and soon she's talked him into murdering her mother (Lainie Kazan) in exchange for her silence. The Crew also features Carrie-Anne Moss as a detective and Jeremy Piven as a mob kingpin out to avenge his father's death(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Three Kings</title>
    <desc lang="en">Three stars team up for this unusual look at America's role in the war against Iraq. In 1991, as the Gulf War winds to a close, three American servicemen find themselves happy to have achieved victory but wondering about the ultimate importance of what they've done (especially since Saddam Hussein is still in power). Major Archie Gates (George Clooney) is a decorated Vietnam veteran and special forces officer with two weeks to go before he retires; Sgt. Troy Barlow (Mark Wahlberg) has a new baby at home; and Chief Elgin (Ice Cube) is probably just going to end up back in Detroit. So when one of them comes across a map that seems to point out where Saddam's forces have stashed a large cache of gold they stole from Kuwait, they decide to follow the trail and take some of the war booty for themselves. However, the deeper they journey into Iraq, the more they see of the consequences of America's policies in the Middle East. Although President George Bush and the American military urged Iraqi citizens to rise up against Saddam Hussein, and pledged their support to a people's movement against the leader, Iraqis found that when they took to the streets against Saddam, the United States did not back them up, and the loss of Iraqi lives was fearsome. When Gates, Barlow and Elgin become aware of what's happening, they're torn between their desire to grab the fortune they came for and the demands of their conscience to help the people they came to liberate. Three Kings was directed by David O. Russell and marked a significant change of direction after his dark-humored relationship comedies, Spanking the Monkey and Flirting with Disaster(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Daredevil</title>
    <desc lang="en">Mark Steven Johnson's violent superhero fantasy-morality play stars Ben Affleck as Matt Murdock, a guilt-wracked blind vigilante with a penchant for red leather. During his childhood, an accident involving toxic waste blinded Murdock, but it also enhanced his other senses and gave him a kind of 'radar vision'. The incident was partially caused by his discovery that his father was involved with the Mob. Now, the adult Murdock, spurred partly by Catholic guilt over his role in his father's death, has dedicated this life to fighting crime and protecting the innocent. By day Murdock's a defence lawyer, but by night he dispenses summary justice to criminals who've escaped the courts. Things get complicated when he falls in love with Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner). Not only is she the daughter of a man with connections to New York crime bosses but, unknown to Murdock, she's also a vigilante who's equally keen on figure-hugging leather (black in her case). And when Daredevil is framed for the murder of her father, Elektra swears vengeance on the masked crime-fighter (not realising that he's her lover). Meanwhile, both of them are in mortal danger from the actual killer, a merciless Irish assassin called Bullseye (Colin Farrell)(n)</desc>

And when she asks her local barman Alex (Justin Long) why men never seem to call her back after a date, his answer turns her understanding of romance upside down. Meanwhile, Janine (Jennifer Connelly) seems to be more interested in working on her house than her marriage to Ben (Bradley Cooper), who in turn strays with yoga teacher Anna (Scarlett Johansson); and Beth (Jennifer Aniston) is having trouble persuading her long-term boyfriend Neil (Ben Affleck) to marry her.

The science of robotics is so advanced that humanoid-looking servants have been developed, ready to obey any command from a human. When the chief designer of US Robotics, the biggest manufacturer of this new brand, is found dead in the company's atrium after a fall from the upper floor, it has all the hallmarks of suicide, and Chicago cop Del Spooner is assigned to the case. But technophobe Spooner doesn't believe that all robots are harmless. Despite opposition from both his superiors and the company, he investigates further and soon his suspicions centre on one robot, Sonny. Is 'he' one of an army of conscious, violent robots ready to challenge their human masters?(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Chicago</title>
    <desc lang="en">A starry-eyed would-be star discovers just how far the notion that "there's no such thing as bad publicity" can go in this screen adaptation of the hit Broadway musical +Chicago, originally directed and choreographed by Bob Fosse. In the mid-'20s, Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) is a small-time chorus dancer married to a well-meaning dunderhead named Amos (John C. Reilly). Roxie is having an affair on the side with Fred Casley (Dominic West), a smooth talker who insists he can make her a star. However, Fred strings Roxie along a bit too far for his own good, and when she realizes that his promises are empty, she becomes enraged and murders Fred in cold blood. Roxie soon finds herself behind bars alongside Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a sexy vaudeville star who used to perform with her sister until Velma discovered that her sister had been sleeping with her husband. Velma shot them both dead, and, after scheming prison matron "Mama" Morton hooks Velma up with hotshot lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), Velma becomes the new Queen of the scandal sheets. Roxie is just shrewd enough to realize that her poor fortune could also bring her fame, so she convinces Amos to also hire Flynn. Soon Flynn is splashing Roxie's story -- or, more accurately, a highly melodramatic revision of Roxie's story -- all over the gutter press, and Roxy and Velma are soon battling neck-to-neck over who can win greater fame through the headlines. A project that had been moving from studio to studio since the musical opened on Broadway in 1973, Chicago also features guest appearances by Lucy Liu and Christine Baranski(n)</desc>

By the time the United States became involved in World War II, John Ford was already a film legend, but when Uncle Sam came calling the veteran filmmaker eagerly packed his bags and set his sites on the frontlines. Though Ford did sustain battlefield injuries during the production of the Oscar-winning documentary The Battle of Midway, the remarkable film endeared him to patriotic American audiences across the country and his next wartime effort, 1943's December 7th, proceeded to earn the filmmaker yet another Oscar. In addition to featuring footage from these and other, lesser-known wartime films from Ford, this documentary also offers an intimate look at the complex filmmaker and explores his remarkable legacy through both archive footage and interviews with such notable directors as Oliver Stone and Peter Bogdanovich(n)</desc>

He wants to know why he, of all people, hasn't been invited to a royal reception in Birmingham being attended by none other than Prince Charles. But then he hears His Royal Highness may be dropping in to the city farm, and he sees his chance - only to discover he still won't get anywhere near the future king unless he can impress the formidable head of the welcoming committee, Marina Fairchild (Belinda Lang, 2point4 Children).(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Shazia is looking forward to having fun with her friends as the day of her hen party arrives, only for a few unwelcome guests to tag along - and she ends up being bombarded with everyone's stories of married life. Meanwhile, Amjad has his stag do, which is being organised by his future father-in-law Mr Khan, so surely nothing can go wrong. Back at the house, the groom is put in a compromising position - and when the two parties collide, the wedding is left hanging in the balance. Kate Robbins guest stars.(n)</desc>

When the stoner duo unwisely smuggle their drugs paraphernalia on to a US bound flight from Amsterdam, US Homeland Security misinterpret their intentions and they are promptly shipped off to the infamous US Army detention camp in Cuba. And so the scene is set for a series of none-too-subtle gags as our THC-loving heroes seek to make their escape. Sophisticated it may not be, but if crude and politically incorrect humour is your thing then there are certainly plenty of laughs to be had here. And the film also seems to raise the question of who's the more paranoid: two long-term marijuana users or the US Government(n)</desc>

And so the scene is set for a series of none-too-subtle gags as our THC-loving heroes seek to make their escape. Sophisticated it may not be, but if crude and politically incorrect humour is your thing then there are certainly plenty of laughs to be had here.

    <title lang="en">The Number 23</title>
    <desc lang="en">Jim Carrey and Virginia Madsen star in this dark psychological thriller from director Joel Schumacher. Walter Sparrow is leading a contented life until his wife Agatha innocently gives him a battered old paperback as a gift. As he reads, Sparrow is astonished by the parallels between his life and that of the novel's protagonist, Fingerling. But as the plot progresses it grows darker, featuring themes of transgressive sex, suicide and murder. It also hinges around Fingerling's obsession with the number 23 - a prime number that seems to pop up everywhere in the universe once you start to notice it. It's not long before 23 takes a similar hold on Sparrow. And, when he begins unjustly to view Agatha in the same distrustful light that Fingerling views his own spouse Fabrizia, it seems as if Sparrow has locked on to the same tragic trajectory as the story's lead character. Or can he find a way to wrench himself from the novel's grip?(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Number 23</title>
    <desc lang="en">Jim Carrey and Virginia Madsen star in this dark psychological thriller from director Joel Schumacher. Walter Sparrow is leading a contented life until his wife Agatha innocently gives him a battered old paperback as a gift. As he reads, Sparrow is astonished by the parallels between his life and that of the novel's protagonist, Fingerling. But as the plot progresses it grows darker, featuring themes of transgressive sex, suicide and murder. It also hinges around Fingerling's obsession with the number 23 - a prime number that seems to pop up everywhere in the universe once you start to notice it. It's not long before 23 takes a similar hold on Sparrow. And, when he begins unjustly to view Agatha in the same distrustful light that Fingerling views his own spouse Fabrizia, it seems as if Sparrow has locked on to the same tragic trajectory as the story's lead character. Or can he find a way to wrench himself from the novel's grip?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Just how low will a guy sink in order to impress the woman of his dreams? How does stealing her dog sound? In Lost and Found, David Spade plays Dylan, who is about to open an new restaurant and has finally found the perfect apartment. The apartment just gets better when he meets his new neighbor, Lila (Sophie Marceau), a very beautiful women who has recently come to the United States from France. However, Lila has just gotten out of a bad relationship with René (Patrick Bruel), who doesn't want to leave her alone, so she has little interest in romance, preferring to devote herself to her cello and her dog Jack. One day, Jack runs away and Dylan finds him; when he returns the pooch to Lila, it's the first time she's been willing to speak in full sentences to him, though not for very long. Faster than you can say "That idea is so crazy it just might work!", Dylan decides to kidnap Jack; when Lila thinks the dog is lost, Dylan will generously volunteer to help look for him, which will give Dylan a chance to impress Lila when he's able to find Jack so quickly. Sure enough, Dylan swipes the dog, but from that point on the plan hardly goes the way he had hoped. Star David Spade also co-wrote the screenplay with J.B. Cook and Marc Meeks; the supporting cast includes Martin Sheen, Mitchell Whitfield, Artie Lang and Jon Lovitz(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Good Guy</title>
    <desc lang="en">After executive producing the acclaimed documentary Manda Bala and the J.M. Coetzee adaptation Disgrace, Julio DePietro makes his feature debut as a writer-director with The Good Guy, a drama about ambitious young Wall Streeters fighting each other -- and sometimes their own decent nature -- to get ahead in the world. Our narrator, Tommy (Scott Porter of TV's Friday Night Lights), is young, clever, charming, and attractive. He's got a smart, pretty girlfriend, Beth (Alexis Bledel of Gilmore Girls), an urban conservationist. He's also very good at his investment broker job, impressing his ruthless, cynical boss, Cash (erstwhile "Brat Pack" member Andrew McCarthy). When a key member of Tommy's sales team suddenly leaves for a competitor, Tommy needs to fill his spot quickly, and takes a chance on the bumbling Daniel (Bryan Greenberg, Bride Wars), a former Marine and computer geek who seems a bit naïve about high finance and a bit nervous around women. Tommy takes Daniel under his wing, showing him how to dress, where to socialize, and how to charm attractive women. Their relationship is threatened when Daniel begins spending more time with Beth, joining her book club, and becoming her confidant. Tommy begins to question his decision to share his wisdom with Daniel, while Daniel is forced to decide what success really means to him, and where his loyalties lie. The Good Guy also stars Anna Chlumsky (In the Loop) and Aaron Yoo (Disturbia). The film had its world premiere at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Set in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn, Spike Lee's thought-provoking and powerful comedy/drama chronicles the events that lead up to a race riot between the residents. The action takes place on the hottest day of the year and centers around a pizza parlor owned by Italian-American Sal. It's a popular hangout for the neighborhood youth. The events leading up to the confrontation are presented episodically and center around, Sal (Danny Aiello), his aimless employee Mookie (Spike Lee) and his pal, the radical Buggin Out (Giancarlo Esposito), who is irritated that Sal's "Wall of Fame" (containing only pictures of famous Italian-Americans) contains no African-American faces and therefore tries unsuccessfully to get the neighborhood blacks, including Mookie, to boycott the restaurant. Radio Raheem, with his blaring boom box permanently affixed to his shoulder, inadvertently becomes the catalyst for violence. As the stories unfold and many colorful satellite characters and their lives are introduced, the temperature rises. With the constant bickering between Mookie and the other employees, the harassment of Buggin Out, and other events, Sal is pushed to the breaking point and makes a fateful decision. Already stressed out and overheated, Sal snaps at closing time when Radio Raheem show up and demands service at the last minute. Violence and tragedy ensue(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Good Guy</title>
    <desc lang="en">After executive producing the acclaimed documentary Manda Bala and the J.M. Coetzee adaptation Disgrace, Julio DePietro makes his feature debut as a writer-director with The Good Guy, a drama about ambitious young Wall Streeters fighting each other -- and sometimes their own decent nature -- to get ahead in the world. Our narrator, Tommy (Scott Porter of TV's Friday Night Lights), is young, clever, charming, and attractive. He's got a smart, pretty girlfriend, Beth (Alexis Bledel of Gilmore Girls), an urban conservationist. He's also very good at his investment broker job, impressing his ruthless, cynical boss, Cash (erstwhile "Brat Pack" member Andrew McCarthy). When a key member of Tommy's sales team suddenly leaves for a competitor, Tommy needs to fill his spot quickly, and takes a chance on the bumbling Daniel (Bryan Greenberg, Bride Wars), a former Marine and computer geek who seems a bit naïve about high finance and a bit nervous around women. Tommy takes Daniel under his wing, showing him how to dress, where to socialize, and how to charm attractive women. Their relationship is threatened when Daniel begins spending more time with Beth, joining her book club, and becoming her confidant. Tommy begins to question his decision to share his wisdom with Daniel, while Daniel is forced to decide what success really means to him, and where his loyalties lie. The Good Guy also stars Anna Chlumsky (In the Loop) and Aaron Yoo (Disturbia). The film had its world premiere at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival(n)</desc>

Stability in Bridget's life, however, quickly becomes a contradiction in terms. Though Mark is openly supportive of Bridget's eccentricities -- and there are many -- she is nonetheless threatened by Mark's young, nubile intern, not to mention irked at finding out that he is, among other less desirable qualities in her eyes, a conservative voter. Complicating issues further is the reentrance of her ex-lover, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant), whom Jones, perhaps mistakenly, thought she had finally gotten over. Before long, the situation escalates into another series of embarrassing circumstances for Bridget, who is faced once again with a crippling feeling of self-doubt and has only her diary and friends to combat it(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Boobs in Arms. World War II was just heating up, but the U.S. hadn't yet entered the fighting when the Three Stooges made this comic short. It opens with the boys selling greeting cards on the street, none too successfully. One surly guy in particular is a victim of the Stooges' harassment. To get away from his wrath, the boys dash into an apartment building, where they find a weepy young woman who thinks her husband doesn't love her anymore. To help her out, the Stooges offer to try to make her husband jealous. The woman's spouse turns out to be the very same man they harassed a few minutes earlier. To get away from him -- again -- the guys get in what they think is a bread line, but it's really a recruitment line for the Army. In a flash the Stooges are in uniform -- only to discover that their sergeant is the very same angry husband. They manage to make it through basic training and are sleeping through bomb blasts when they're woken up and sent on a mission. The sergeant has been captured and they're supposed to bomb enemy headquarters with laughing gas. Naturally, the gas shell explodes on them and they're captured. At the enemy headquarters, they manage to knock everyone unconscious while laughing uncontrollably. The place is being shelled by the American troops, and the Stooges, still laughing, ride one of the shells as it soars out of the building(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Dutch has a code of honor which he will not violate, even when his life depends on it. Paradoxically, his code of honor gives him the backbone to survive as a military special forces operative when he is sent on a covert mission to rescue another group which was sent in to assist some nefarious U.S. government plan in a Latin American country. Once there, he encounters an old army buddy who has gotten too deep in the CIA's good graces for Dutch's comfort. When he and his team go into the jungle to rescue the others, they get involved in a pitched battle with local guerillas, but they are more than capable of besting these vicious fighters. However, not long after that, they encounter signs that the equally capable men they were sent to rescue were all killed unawares and in an unusually gruesome fashion. Given their training, it should have been impossible for anyone to best all of these commando warriors. Soon, the men from Dutch's own team get picked off one by one, as they grow aware that they are up against something uncanny, not of this world, something that is hunting them for sport. Why? Because their skills make them worthy opponents for the perfectly camouflaged Predator(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Predator</title>
    <desc lang="en">Dutch has a code of honor which he will not violate, even when his life depends on it. Paradoxically, his code of honor gives him the backbone to survive as a military special forces operative when he is sent on a covert mission to rescue another group which was sent in to assist some nefarious U.S. government plan in a Latin American country. Once there, he encounters an old army buddy who has gotten too deep in the CIA's good graces for Dutch's comfort. When he and his team go into the jungle to rescue the others, they get involved in a pitched battle with local guerillas, but they are more than capable of besting these vicious fighters. However, not long after that, they encounter signs that the equally capable men they were sent to rescue were all killed unawares and in an unusually gruesome fashion. Given their training, it should have been impossible for anyone to best all of these commando warriors. Soon, the men from Dutch's own team get picked off one by one, as they grow aware that they are up against something uncanny, not of this world, something that is hunting them for sport. Why? Because their skills make them worthy opponents for the perfectly camouflaged Predator(n)</desc>

Now trapped in a darkened cloud of pure horror, the frightened denizens of the town are forced to fend off an advancing horde of murderous monsters. Punisher star Thomas Jane heads up an ensemble cast that includes Andre Braugher, Laurie Holden, William Sadler, and Marcia Gay Harden(n)</desc>

Highlights include scorpions shaking their booty, the perfume-wearing nasonia wasp and the tropical cricket, for whom romance goes out of the window as it uses bribery to seal the deal with would-be partners. One potential partner to steer well clear of, however, is the praying mantis, the female of which is notorious for eating the male just after - or even during - mating.

Size matters for the minuscule male orb spider, creepily sneaking up on its intended and trying to mate without her noticing, while there's no rest for the lothario-like butterfly, which has plenty of notches on its proverbial bedpost. However, the harvestman spider has no use for sex at all, and reproduces by cloning itself.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Arthur and the Invisibles</title>
    <desc lang="en">On the heels of his first foray into romantic comedy, versatile French filmmaker Luc Besson breaks new ground yet again with this computer-animated, family-friendly adaptation of his own children's book Arthur and the Minimoys. Arthur is a wide-eyed ten-year-old whose vivid imagination is fueled by the colorful bedtime stories his grandmother reads to him each night. His dreams are filled with images of African tribes and the remarkable inventions detailed in the enigmatic book that his grandfather left behind after mysteriously disappearing four years ago. Arthur and his family are in danger of losing their home to an unscrupulous real-estate developer, but if there is any truth to the tales of a treasure hidden deep beneath their garden and the tiny, fairy-like creatures that his grandmother so frequently sketches, there may still be hope of saving their home before it's too late.

    <title lang="en">Arthur and the Invisibles</title>
    <desc lang="en">On the heels of his first foray into romantic comedy, versatile French filmmaker Luc Besson breaks new ground yet again with this computer-animated, family-friendly adaptation of his own children's book Arthur and the Minimoys. Arthur is a wide-eyed ten-year-old whose vivid imagination is fueled by the colorful bedtime stories his grandmother reads to him each night. His dreams are filled with images of African tribes and the remarkable inventions detailed in the enigmatic book that his grandfather left behind after mysteriously disappearing four years ago. Arthur and his family are in danger of losing their home to an unscrupulous real-estate developer, but if there is any truth to the tales of a treasure hidden deep beneath their garden and the tiny, fairy-like creatures that his grandmother so frequently sketches, there may still be hope of saving their home before it's too late. Now, with nothing to guide him but the clues left behind by his grandfather, Arthur will set out to find the mythical world of Seven Kingdoms, where the Minimoys are said to dwell, and ensure that his troubled family always has a place to call home. An imaginative children's fantasy in the vein of J.M. Barrie's +Peter Pan, Arthur and the Invisibles features the voices of David Bowie, Snoop Dogg, Madonna, Mia Farrow, and Freddie Highmore(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Cinderella Man</title>
    <desc lang="en">The true story of an athlete who achieved his greatest success against the most daunting odds of his life is brought to the screen in this historical drama. In the 1920s, James Braddock (Russell Crowe) from Bergen, NJ, was a promising contender in professional boxing; he had strength, spirit, and tenacity, but the combination of a serious hand injury and a 1929 defeat in a bout with light heavyweight champ Tommy Loughran sent his career into a serious tailspin. As Braddock's career in the ring dried up, the Great Depression put a stake through the heart of America's economy, and Braddock found himself working at the New York docks for pitiful wages as he tried to support his wife, Mae (Renée Zellweger), and three children. Desperate for money, Braddock turned to his former trainer and manager Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti), who was unexpectedly able to scare up a bout for him, battling John Griffin at Madison Square Garden. While conventional wisdom had it that Braddock was too old, out of shape, and out of practice to have any chance of winning, he defeated Griffin, and continued beating his opponents with a powerful left hook that had been intensified by years of punishing dock work. In a nation desperate for good news, Braddock's surprising comeback became a tonic to struggling workers and unemployed people, and all eyes were on Braddock when in 1935 he took on powerful heavyweight champion Max Baer (Craig Bierko) in what was both literally and figuratively the fight of his life(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Mystery, Alaska</title>
    <desc lang="en">In this comic drama about fame, sports, and small-town life, Mystery, Alaska is a small town in one of the least accessible parts of the coldest state in the union. It's a town where everyone knows each other and there isn't much to do. In places like this, small things tend to become very important, and in Mystery, the one thing that keeps everyone sane is hockey. Most of the men of Mystery are obsessive hockey fans, and a local hockey league has sprung up, with pools of neighborhood talent facing off on the ice every week. When a national sports magazine does a story on the hockey fans of Mystery, Alaska, someone at the National Hockey League gets an idea for a publicity stunt: send the New York Rangers to Mystery to play the local all-stars in a nationally televised game. Most of the locals are thrilled; the game will give the people of Mystery a chance to bask in the limelight and make their sleepy town a household word. On the other hand, in a small town where everyone knows everyone else's secrets, this event could cause everyone to start airing their dirty laundry in public, with the whole world watching. Mystery, Alaska was directed by Jay Roach, who enjoyed considerable success with the two Austin Powers films, and stars Russell Crowe as John Biebe, Mary McCormack as his wife Donna, Burt Reynolds as Judge Burns, and Lolita Davidovich as Mary Jane(n)</desc>

It's that time of the year, and as the snow falls outside and families gather around the dinner table, Angela vows to close one last deal before the holiday. Now late for her family gathering, Angela rushes down to the garage in hopes of racing home and catching dinner before it gets cold. When her car refuses to start, her phone fails to get a signal, and everyone else has already left, it begins to appear as if Angela's luck may have finally run out. Thankfully, a friendly security guard appears and offers to lend a helping hand. During the course of discussion, the security guard flirtatiously invites Angela to share the Christmas dinner he has prepared in the parking office -- an offer that the high-powered corporate climber laughingly dismisses. The next thing Angela knows, she wakes up tied to a chair in the cold security office located on level P2. It appears as if the security guard's invitation wasn't optional, and that Christmas dinner was the last thing on his mind. Upon realizing just how serious her situation truly is, Angela struggles to escape her subterranean prison and make it out so that she might live to see another Christmas morning(n)</desc>

John Tucker (Jesse Metcalfe) is the big man on campus at his high school -- he's the captain and star player of the basketball team, he's got money, he's good-looking and charming, and he can have any girl he wants. However, the latter attribute is about to get him in serious trouble when three different girls at his school -- Heather (Ashanti), Beth (Sophia Bush) and Carrie (Arielle Kebbel) -- discover they've all been dating John at the same time. Determined to bring down the campus ladykiller, the girls devise a plan -- they pick a cute but socially clumsy girl who is new at school, Kate (Brittany Snow), and give her a crash course in stealing John's heart. Once Kate has John wrapped around her little finger, she's supposed to drop him like a bad habit and give him a taste of what heartbreak is really like. However, it seems that the early stages of the plan work a little too well, and John and Kate end up falling for each other for real. John Tucker Must Die also stars Jenny McCarthy, Penn Badgley, and Dan Payne(n)</desc>

It's that time of the year, and as the snow falls outside and families gather around the dinner table, Angela vows to close one last deal before the holiday. Now late for her family gathering, Angela rushes down to the garage in hopes of racing home and catching dinner before it gets cold. When her car refuses to start, her phone fails to get a signal, and everyone else has already left, it begins to appear as if Angela's luck may have finally run out. Thankfully, a friendly security guard appears and offers to lend a helping hand. During the course of discussion, the security guard flirtatiously invites Angela to share the Christmas dinner he has prepared in the parking office -- an offer that the high-powered corporate climber laughingly dismisses. The next thing Angela knows, she wakes up tied to a chair in the cold security office located on level P2. It appears as if the security guard's invitation wasn't optional, and that Christmas dinner was the last thing on his mind. Upon realizing just how serious her situation truly is, Angela struggles to escape her subterranean prison and make it out so that she might live to see another Christmas morning(n)</desc>

John Tucker (Jesse Metcalfe) is the big man on campus at his high school -- he's the captain and star player of the basketball team, he's got money, he's good-looking and charming, and he can have any girl he wants. However, the latter attribute is about to get him in serious trouble when three different girls at his school -- Heather (Ashanti), Beth (Sophia Bush) and Carrie (Arielle Kebbel) -- discover they've all been dating John at the same time. Determined to bring down the campus ladykiller, the girls devise a plan -- they pick a cute but socially clumsy girl who is new at school, Kate (Brittany Snow), and give her a crash course in stealing John's heart. Once Kate has John wrapped around her little finger, she's supposed to drop him like a bad habit and give him a taste of what heartbreak is really like. However, it seems that the early stages of the plan work a little too well, and John and Kate end up falling for each other for real. John Tucker Must Die also stars Jenny McCarthy, Penn Badgley, and Dan Payne(n)</desc>

Freshly minted from Harvard, Sam (Christian Bale) and Alex (Kate Beckinsale) are eager to continue their medical studies out West, but they need some lodging while they hunt for a home. Enter Jane (Frances McDormand), Sam's estranged, Age-of-Aquarius mom, who's more than willing to put the couple up in her lavish digs. Jane is a successful record producer whose latest charge -- both in the studio and in her bedroom -- is Ian (Alessandro Nivola), a brazen, libidinous twentysomething Brit-rocker. As Sam and Alex settle in at Jane's, they gradually lose their straight-and-narrow approach to life and begin to experiment. Alex takes to Ian and Jane, while Sam is wooed by co-worker Sara (Natascha McElhone). Laurel Canyon features a score by Shudder to Think's Craig Wedren; the music for Ian's band was provided by Sparklehorse's Mark Linkous and indie-rockers Folk Implosion(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Commercial director Noam Murro makes the leap to feature films with this comedy drama concerning an aging professor-turned-bitter eccentric due to the death of his longtime wife. Ever since his wife passed away, Lawrence Wetherhold (Dennis Quaid) has become overly acerbic and self-absorbed. He's alienated his son (Ashton Holmes) and transformed his daughter (Ellen Page) into a friendless overachiever. Now, at the precise moment Lawrence thought he had finally figured it all out, his life comes crashing down all around him as he falls for a former student (Sarah Jessica Parker) and his shiftless adopted brother (Thomas Haden Church) comes knocking on the door in search of a place to stay. Though Lawrence always relied on his intelligence to get him out of life's little jams in the past, it's going to take quite a bit more than intellectual thinking to move past this sticky stage in his suddenly chaotic life. David Denman and Christine Lahti co-star in this romantic comedy drama, which serves as the screenwriting debut of Goats and Modern Ranch Living author Mark Jude Poirier(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Upon discovering that a psychotic serial killer has been using his writings as inspiration, legendary author Edgar Allan Poe (John Cusack) joins forces with a bright, young Baltimore detective to catch the maniac and end his reign of terror. Detective Emmett Fields (Luke Evans) was investigating a vicious murder when he realized the crime scene bore a striking resemblance to a mystery story that was just published in the local newspaper. The author of that ominous tale was Edgar Allan Poe, a brilliant young writer whose status as a social outcast catches the attention of the diligent detective. Shortly after Poe is questioned by the authorities, detectives stumble upon yet another murder scene that seems to have been inspired by the author's morbid writings. Convinced that the killer will once again use Poe's writings as a springboard to murder, Detective Fields recruits the reclusive author to help piece together a pattern to the crimes and stop the madman before he can strike again. Brendan Gleeson and Alice Eve co-star in this tense period thriller from director James McTeigue (V for Vendetta)(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Before the Flintstones were everyone's favorite Stone Age family, Fred was just a regular guy looking for the girl of his dreams, and his romance with Wilma sets the stage for this prequel to the 1994 screen adaptation of the popular cartoon series. Fred Flintstone (Mark Addy), a working-class caveman who earns his living at Mr. Slate's quarry, falls in love with wealthy heiress Wilma Slaghoople (Kristen Johnson). While many people think that Fred is out of his league, including Wilma's mother Pearl (Joan Collins) and her father Col. Slaghoople (Harvey Korman), he's determined to win her heart. And when his best friend Barney Rubble (Stephen Baldwin) decides to take his best girl Betty (Jane Krakowski) for a fun weekend in Rock Vegas, he invites Wilma to tag along. The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas recasts all the major roles from 1994's The Flintstones; Harvey Korman is the only actor to appear in both films, though in different roles (in the previous movie, he was the voice of the Dictabird)(n)</desc>

Born and raised in a working-class Connecticut community, Luke McNamara (Joshua Jackson) made it into an Ivy League college, where he's done quite well; his dream is to be accepted into Harvard Law School, but he knows that it will take more than a good report card to beat out the competition. When an upper-crust secret society called the Skulls asks Luke to join, he eagerly accepts, thinking that the club's connections will help him gain acceptance to Harvard. He enjoys the Skulls' luxurious lifestyle, but when his roommate, a journalism student, dies of an apparent suicide, he's convinced that something is wrong. The deeper Luke digs into the secrets of the Skulls, the more he's convinced that his friend's death was no suicide and that he's put himself in more danger than he imagined. The Skulls was the first starring vehicle for Joshua Jackson, who gained fame on the TV series Dawson's Creek; the supporting cast includes Paul Walker, Craig T. Nelson, Hill Harper, and William L.

    <desc lang="en">Live-action filmmaking mixes with imaginative animation in director Michael Landon Jr.'s feature adaptation of author Margery Williams' beloved children's book. An energetic child with a vivid imagination, Toby Morgan (Matthew Harbour) lives with his father (Kevin Jubinville), a successful businessman who seemed to shut down emotionally following the death of Toby's mother. When Toby is sent to spend the Christmas holidays with his loving but stern grandmother (Una Kay), he wanders through the lonely house until he eventually discovers the "magic attic" that was once his father's childhood playroom. There, Toby is surprised to find that his mother left him a stuffed velveteen rabbit -- her final gift to her beloved son. Hugging the rabbit close as he starts to cry, the grieving boy watches in wonder as his tears magically bring the toy to life. Before long, Toby is frolicking in the enchanted attic with a whole new group of friends, including the impetuous Horse (voiced by Tom Skerritt) and the wise but skittish Swan (voice of Ellen Burstyn). Toby's one wish is to spend Christmas with his father, and Rabbit's one wish is to someday hop across the fields as a real rabbit. Later, when Toby falls seriously ill, the courageous Rabbit helps him to win over his grandmother and make a full recovery. When Toby's father returns in time for Christmas, the power of the young child's love grants the Velveteen Rabbit its one true wish(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Mind and the Matter. First telecast May 12, 1961, this amusing Twilight Zone entry was purely and simply a showcase for versatile comic actor Shelley Berman. The star is cast as Archibald Beechcroft, a dyed-in-the-wool misanthrope who despises everyone around him. With the help of an unusual "will power" book given to him by office boy Henry (Jack Grinnage), Beechcroft is able to make everyone else in the world disappear. Before long, however, the silence drives Beechcroft crazy, so he decides to populate the world with millions of Archibald Beechcrofts -- with similarly irksome results. "The Mind and the Matter" was written by series creator Rod Serling(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Obsolete Man. The second season of Twilight Zone came to a powerful conclusion with this Rod Serling-scripted "message" drama. In a futuristic society where books and religion have been outlawed, librarian Romney Wordsworth stands on trial for his life. Adjudged "obsolete" by the imperious Chancellor (Fritz Weaver), Wordsworth is sentenced to death, whereupon he makes one last, unusual request: He wants to have his execution televised, and he wants the Chancellor to be in attendance. The episode's Kafkaesque ending might have packed even more of a punch had director Eliot Silverstein's original concept been carried out to the fullest. "The Obsolete Man" was originally telecast June 2, 1961(n)</desc>

So says William Bloom during the opening stages of Tim Burton's Big Fish. Bloom's father is Edward Bloom,an old codger who may be largely benign but is deemed a bullshitter by his son, and a selfish one at that. Edward's endless recounting of yarns about himself has distanced father and son. But when Edward is diagnosed with terminal cancer, William returns to the family home to try and make his peace, and find out who his father really is. Bed-bound, and with an audience of not just the cynical William but also his receptive wife Josephine, Edward recounts his remarkable life in fragments(n)</desc>

A perpetual outsider both at home and at school, Jess Aarons (Josh Hutcherson) just never seems to fit in no matter how hard he tries. When his goal to become the fastest runner in middle school is unexpectedly thwarted by newly arrived classmate Leslie Burke (AnnaSophia Robb), who enters in an "all boys" race and leaves her competitors in the dust, Jess soon strikes up a friendship with the imaginative outsider. Their bond is soon cemented thanks to Leslie's love for storytelling and Jess' skill as an artist, and the two lonely kids create a secret kingdom called Terabithia that is only accessible by swinging over a stream on a nearby rope. Though Jess and Leslie may be considered outcasts by their classmates, their adventures in Terabithia find the pair doing battle against the dreaded Dark Master and his malevolent creatures while plotting revenge against the schoolyard bullies. Now, thanks to his adventures in Terabithia and his friendship with Leslie, Jess finally finds the confidence needed to stand tall and be himself(n)</desc>

Elsewhere, Phoebe's (Lisa Kudrow) relationship with Mike (Paul Rudd) hits another snag in the form of his girlfriend "Precious" (Anne Dudek), and back in New York, Monica (Courteney Cox) goes to outrageous lengths to "tame" her unnaturally poofy hairdo(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) joins Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and a band of dwarves led by the brave Thorin (Richard Armitage) on a treacherous quest to reclaim their mountain home from the fierce dragon Smaug in this epic fantasy adventure adapted from J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved novel by the creative forces behind the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Long before Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) made his arduous journey to Mordor, his brave uncle Bilbo embarked on an adventure for the ages. Bilbo's story gets under way when the great wizard Gandalf appears at his front gate with a most unusual offer. Displaced from their massive fortress in the Lonely Mountain by Smaug - a greedy dragon who coveted their gold - a community of noble dwarves were decimated by a surprise attack by monstrous orcs, whose dreaded leader the Pale Orc slew their king in a gruesome battle. Now, Thorin, the descendent of the king, is determined to reclaim his mountain kingdom for his people. Together with a fearless team of dwarves, Thorin and Gandalf recruit Bilbo to aid them in their quest since Hobbits have the unique ability to go undetected when they wish to. Before Bilbo, Gandalf, and the dwarves can reach The Lonely Mountain and defeat Smaug, however, they'll have to contend with trolls, goblins, stone giants, Gollum (Andy Serkis), and even the dreaded Pale Orc himself. Peter Jackson directs a screenplay he co-penned with Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, and Guillermo del Toro(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Katie</title>
    <desc lang="en">Documenting the life of 22-year-old Katie O'Halloran from Cill Chiarain, Connemara, who was born with femur-fibula-ulna syndrome, which left her without hands and with a short leg. Doctors told her family that she would never walk, and from a young age she used her leg to eat and write. With assistance, she attended both national and secondary schools, and went on to study law in NUI, Galway. In 2013, Katie discovered that new bebionic hands were available, and this programme follows her and the community as they attempt to raise funds for this life-changing opportunity.(n)</desc>
