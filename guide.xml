    <title lang="en">Dark Water</title>
    <desc lang="en">Directed by Walter Salles Jr., this remake of Hideo Nakata's supernatural psychological drama Honogurai Mizuno Soko Kara revolves around the plight of a single mother (Jennifer Connelly) whose messy divorce and subsequent battle for the custody of her five-year-old daughter is taking a heavy toll on her emotional well-being. Ultimately, the mother and daughter are able to relocate to an apartment, which, despite its excessively dilapidated interior, seems to be an adequate location for beginning a new life. Before long, however, what appears to be the spirit of a young girl begins to haunt them. No stranger to mental illness, the wary young woman brushes the visions aside as part of the inherent stress of making the transition from housewife to working, single mom. As time goes by and the apparent haunting does not subside, the apartment's new residents are forced to examine the history of its former tenants. Dark Water also features performances from John C. Reilly, Tim Roth, and Dougray Scott(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Director Scott Derrickson's remake of the 1951 sci-fi classic replaces the original's theme of fear of impending nuclear war with current concerns for environmental catastrophe. Keanu Reeves stars as Klaatu, an alien sent by a confederation of extraterrestrial beings to warn the inhabitants of Earth that the biosphere is on the verge of collapse. Predictably, as soon as he emerges from his spaceship a trigger-happy soldier ignores his instructions and takes a shot at the visitor. The wounded Klaatu asks for access to the United Nations to deliver his message, but the Secretary of Defence, Regina Jackson, instead orders that he should be taken away for further investigations. Klaatu becomes increasingly convinced that Earth can only survive if mankind is eradicated..(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">After successfully seeking out the ultimate slider in the 2004 stoner comedy Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle, the cannabis-craving twosome returns in this high-flying sequel that finds them labeled terrorists for attempting to sneak a marijuana-smoking implement on a flight to Amsterdam. Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) have just finished gorging themselves on savory White Castle hamburgers when they return to their apartment and hatch a plan for Harold to win the heart of his crush, Maria (Paula Garcés). Maria is going to Amsterdam, and if Harold can catch up with her overseas perhaps he can strike up a real love connection. After a close call with airport personnel and a chance encounter with Kumar's ex-girlfriend Vanessa (Danneel Harris) -- who hadn't yet told Kumar that she's engaged to be married -- the pot-loving pals finally board their flight for Amsterdam. Unfortunately for Harold, Kumar isn't able to endure the lengthy flight without an innocent puff or two from his smokeless bong. When the plane hits some turbulence and the bong is mistaken for a bomb, the flight is diverted to Guantanamo Bay and our spliff-smoking heroes are detained by overzealous Deputy Chief of Homeland Security Ron Fox (Rob Corddry). Now, if they can just escape from the world's most notorious prison compound, perhaps this hapless duo can succeed in convincing the authorities that they aren't enemy combatants, and that Kumar made the mistake of his life by letting Vanessa go. But before they can prove their innocence and get the girls, Harold and Kumar will have to outsmart the dreaded Ku Klux Klan, contend with a particularly precocious Cyclops baby, and successfully elude everyone's favorite debauched former child star -- Neil Patrick Harris(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Leatherheads</title>
    <desc lang="en">Good Night, and Good Luck director George Clooney pulls double duty once again in this sports-oriented romantic comedy set against the formation of professional football in the 1920s. Dodge Connelly (Clooney) is a brash and handsome gridiron giant who is equally comfortable leading his team in a barroom brawl or charging for a touchdown in a packed stadium. But when Connelly's team loses their sponsor and the entire league appears set to collapse, the quick-thinking jock attempts a creative late-game comeback. If Connelly can convince former college football star and decorated war hero Carter Rutherford (John Krasinski) to join the team, there may be hope for the ill-fated team after all. Back in World War I, Rutherford single-handedly forced the surrender of multiple German soldiers -- a feat that firmly established the dashing young soldier as America's favorite son. Not only that, but Rutherford's unparalleled speed makes him a valuable asset to the team. To cub reporter Lexie Littleton (Renée Zellweger), Rutherford seems simply too good to be true, and she's determined to prove that her theory is correct. As Littleton digs deep into Rutherford's past, the two teammates enter into a fierce competition for her erratic affections. Now, as Connelly's plan begins to work better than he ever could have anticipated, the rowdy sport he always loved starts to take on a whole new look and feel. In the midst of holding his team together and simultaneously charming the girl of his dreams, Connelly discovers he may be able to use the same strategies he does to win on the field to win in love. Of course, there might be a few fouls as this game enters the fourth quarter, but like every good player, Connelly knows the value of always having a secret play to fall back on before the final score is called(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Punch Drunks. While this was the second short that The Three Stooges shot for Columbia, this one is the first where they use their own names (and, thankfully, they don't have to talk in couplets, like they did in their first, Woman Haters). Stooge Moe Howard plays a down-on-his-luck fight manager. While eating at a restaurant with some cronies, he finds himself a new fighter -- their waiter (Curly Howard). When a hungry violinist (Larry Fine) offers to play for some soup and begins a lively rendition of "Pop Goes the Weasel," Curly goes into a conniption fit that would soon become classic Stooge fare -- slapping his face, dancing around and "Woop-wooping" wildly. Before anyone can move, he's knocked out all of Moe's pals -- and the restaurant's manager. Moe grabs both Curly and Larry and the trio work their way up in the boxing world -- until one bout in which an accident breaks Larry's violin. Curly takes a brutal beating from Killer Kilduff while Larry runs all over town! looking for something -- anything -- that is playing "Pop Goes the Weasel." He finds a politician's campaign truck blaring the tune from its speakers and races it to the arena in time for Curly to win the fight. In fact, the song -- and Curly's fit -- doesn't stop until Moe and Larry also wind up in a heap in the ring. The Stooges would use this same gag -- Curly stimulated into going nuts -- in at least two other films, 1935's Horses' Collars and 1937's Grips, Grunts and Groans(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Arrival</title>
    <desc lang="en">They have been saying for years that the Greenhouse Effect is going to destroy the planet. For years humans have blamed themselves for spewing climate-changing gasses into our fragile atmosphere. But are we as guilty as we think we are or are there more sinister forces at work? Paying tribute to an old-fashioned '50s style paranoid (the aliens have come to take over the planet) sci-fi low-budget thriller, this film gives a chilling answer to that question. It begins with the scene of a young woman picking poppies in a verdant field. She is obviously puzzled and as the camera pulls away it becomes clear why. The story then jumps to a California observatory where nerdish radio telescope operator Zane Ziminski is suddenly jarred from the boredom of monitoring random space noises by a strangely regular series of unearthly blips that he is convinced come from an alien galaxy and for some reason are being deliberately beamed to Earth. Excitedly he takes the recorded evidence to his boss, who promptly fires him. Convinced that the aliens were transmitting messages to aliens already on our planet, Ziminski quickly builds a make-shift radio telescope and high tech computer system in his garage so he can pinpoit the destination of the singles. This leads him to an isolated Mexican village where he and another scientist (the lady from the poppy field), who has drawn similar conclusions, team up and go alien-hunting. They don't hunt long, for the villagers turn out to be mighty strange people. From there it is only a short time before they find the underground alien lair where they learn that the invaders' home planet is dying and that they are planning to "terraform" the Earth in preparation of colonizing it. Part of the process involves deliberately accelerating the Greenhouse effect. The special effects are well-done and refreshingly, they are not overpowering(n)</desc>

The cable documentary series Weaponology investigates the science of warfare as it has progressed and developed - over the centuries - from crude battlefield contraptions to diabolically inventive weaponry. Each episode hones in on one particular category of weapon and discusses its historical evolution and strategic employment on the front lines. The episode entitled "sniper rifles" discusses the background and use of the titular guns, designed to pick off human targets from a lengthy and safe vantage point. The program spans the entire history of the sniper rifle, from the German Jaegers of the 1700s to the Barrett AS50 of the 21th century, and reveals how weaponry has enabled snipers to now shoot at a distance of over 2,000 yards. Subtopics include sights, camouflage, bullets, sniper techniques and much more(n)</desc>

She then passes through the Islamic city Fes, home to the world's oldest university, catches a train to the great market town of Marrakech and treks across the Atlas Mountains, before visiting the ancient caves of salt, the commodity that gave the roads their name.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Dan Jones explores the 900-year history of Leeds Castle in Kent, from its origins as a royal Saxon family's manor and Norman stronghold to the private property of six medieval queens, a Tudor palace, a Jacobean country house and a Georgian mansion. Its last owner, Lady Olive Baillie, made it a centre of lavish hospitality for leading politicians, international royalty and film stars. When she died in 1974, she bequeathed the castle and grounds to a specially created charitable trust so that future generations could enjoy her home.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Arrival</title>
    <desc lang="en">They have been saying for years that the Greenhouse Effect is going to destroy the planet. For years humans have blamed themselves for spewing climate-changing gasses into our fragile atmosphere. But are we as guilty as we think we are or are there more sinister forces at work? Paying tribute to an old-fashioned '50s style paranoid (the aliens have come to take over the planet) sci-fi low-budget thriller, this film gives a chilling answer to that question. It begins with the scene of a young woman picking poppies in a verdant field. She is obviously puzzled and as the camera pulls away it becomes clear why. The story then jumps to a California observatory where nerdish radio telescope operator Zane Ziminski is suddenly jarred from the boredom of monitoring random space noises by a strangely regular series of unearthly blips that he is convinced come from an alien galaxy and for some reason are being deliberately beamed to Earth. Excitedly he takes the recorded evidence to his boss, who promptly fires him. Convinced that the aliens were transmitting messages to aliens already on our planet, Ziminski quickly builds a make-shift radio telescope and high tech computer system in his garage so he can pinpoit the destination of the singles. This leads him to an isolated Mexican village where he and another scientist (the lady from the poppy field), who has drawn similar conclusions, team up and go alien-hunting. They don't hunt long, for the villagers turn out to be mighty strange people. From there it is only a short time before they find the underground alien lair where they learn that the invaders' home planet is dying and that they are planning to "terraform" the Earth in preparation of colonizing it. Part of the process involves deliberately accelerating the Greenhouse effect. The special effects are well-done and refreshingly, they are not overpowering(n)</desc>

Emilio (Miguel Varoni) and Alejandro (Fernando Colunga) have hatched a plan for the perfect crime, but in order to carry out their caper the diabolical duo will need a crack crew who can stealthily inject themselves into the inner circle of their wealthy mark. Moctesuma Valdez is a man of power with many personal servants, and if Emilio and Alejandro's team can simply assume the guise of gardener, maid, or chauffer, they will be in the perfect position to strike when Valdez least expects it. When the skilled members of the regular team all reject the plan, Emilio and Alejandro are forced to hire "real" immigrants to get the job done. From electronics expert Julio to father/daughter transportation team Rafa and Rafaela and skilled disguise artist Miguelito it seems as if all of the elements have come together, but what to make of a crew who has all of the qualifications and no actual criminal experience?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Driven by an extravagant, tour-de-force performance by Al Pacino, Scent of a Woman is the story of Frank Slade (Pacino), a blind, retired army colonel who hires Charlie Simms (Chris O'Donnell), a poor college student on the verge of expulsion, to take care of him over Thanksgiving weekend. At the beginning of the weekend, Frank takes Charlie to New York, where he reveals to the student that he intends to visit his family, have a few terrific meals, sleep with a beautiful woman and, finally, commit suicide. The film follows the mis-matched pair over the course of the weekend, as they learn about life through their series of adventures. Though the story is a little contrived and predictable, it pulls all the right strings, thanks to O'Donnell's sympathetic supporting role and Pacino's powerful lead performance, for which he won his first Academy Award. Scent of a Woman is based on the 1975 Italian film Profumo Di Donna(n)</desc>

Emilio (Miguel Varoni) and Alejandro (Fernando Colunga) have hatched a plan for the perfect crime, but in order to carry out their caper the diabolical duo will need a crack crew who can stealthily inject themselves into the inner circle of their wealthy mark. Moctesuma Valdez is a man of power with many personal servants, and if Emilio and Alejandro's team can simply assume the guise of gardener, maid, or chauffer, they will be in the perfect position to strike when Valdez least expects it. When the skilled members of the regular team all reject the plan, Emilio and Alejandro are forced to hire "real" immigrants to get the job done. From electronics expert Julio to father/daughter transportation team Rafa and Rafaela and skilled disguise artist Miguelito it seems as if all of the elements have come together, but what to make of a crew who has all of the qualifications and no actual criminal experience?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Driven by an extravagant, tour-de-force performance by Al Pacino, Scent of a Woman is the story of Frank Slade (Pacino), a blind, retired army colonel who hires Charlie Simms (Chris O'Donnell), a poor college student on the verge of expulsion, to take care of him over Thanksgiving weekend. At the beginning of the weekend, Frank takes Charlie to New York, where he reveals to the student that he intends to visit his family, have a few terrific meals, sleep with a beautiful woman and, finally, commit suicide. The film follows the mis-matched pair over the course of the weekend, as they learn about life through their series of adventures. Though the story is a little contrived and predictable, it pulls all the right strings, thanks to O'Donnell's sympathetic supporting role and Pacino's powerful lead performance, for which he won his first Academy Award. Scent of a Woman is based on the 1975 Italian film Profumo Di Donna(n)</desc>

Brian also meets members of the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence, who have been monitoring radio signals for 50 years without success, before discussing the ingredients needed to make an intelligent civilisation with astrophysicist Dr Frank Drake.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Is mankind alone, or are there aliens out there, either waiting to be discovered, or on their way to find Earth? Professor Brian Cox spends this episode asking such questions, and what he discovers may raise a few eyebrows. He begins by exploring the human race's efforts to find neighbours in outer space, including the launch of two golden discs containing a greeting from Earth in the 1970s; they are still travelling and are now the most distant man-made objects from the planet. Brian also meets members of the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence, who have been monitoring radio signals for 50 years without success, before discussing the ingredients needed to make an intelligent civilisation with astrophysicist Dr Frank Drake.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Shooting</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Monte Hellman used his beloved "hunter as hunted" theme for his near-existential western The Shooting. Jack Nicholson and Warren Oates are starred in this bare-bones tale of an ex-bounty hunter (Oates) with a price on his head and the cocky young gun (Nicholson) who hopes to collect. The film seems to be exclusively populated by Life's Losers; but even with portents of doom throughout, the ending is still a jaw-dropping experience. Demonstrating the parsimony he'd learned while working with Roger Corman, director Hellman shot The Shooting in Utah simultaneously with another feature, Ride in the Whirlwind, for a combined budget of $150,000. Completed in 1967, The Shooting did not receive widespread release until after Jack Nicholson achieved stardom in the early 1970s(n)</desc>

Ken loves the city and its history; Ray hates it, until he hooks up with beautiful drugs dealer Chloe and a mouthy dwarf actor, Jimmy. Unfortunately, just as life seems to be improving for the two hitmen, psychopathic Harry phones to deliver stark instructions: the nature of the botched hit has offended his sense of morality and he's decided to break up the partnership, ordering one of the duo to kill the other. This tests the bond linking the three men, and leads to a violent denouement in the ancient city's cobbled streets(n)</desc>

But with success comes competition, and Untouchable J (Jay-Z) and Dame (Damon Dash), the leaders of an establish drug-dealing crew, decide the ABM are taking more than their share of the business, and begin retaliating with violence -- with both the ABM crew and Beans' wife as targets.

All their efforts take place at a summer garden party attended by their family and friends, and judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood decide who most deserves the 2013 title.

    <desc lang="en">The second lot of six hopefuls are sent to the Fire Service College in Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire, where they are split into two teams of three to make lunch for 200 firefighters. But they aren't just rustling up one dish - each trio has to concoct two different main courses and desserts for the hungry firemen and women. Then it's back to MasterChef HQ to prepare 20 breakfast portions in just one hour, before the weakest contestants face each other in a cook-off to determine who will make it through to Friday's `showstopper' challenge - the gateway to this year's semi-finals.(n)</desc>

As the wave of self-destruction spreads, people naturally enough do their best to escape whatever it is that's causing it. Among them are Philadelphia science teacher Elliot Moore and his wife Alma, along with Mark's friend Julian and his daughter Jess. Their initial plans to flee to the state capital don't work out, so they take off to the countryside, where they think they'll be safe. But it's not long before they discover that they may have made a bad choice..(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Marley &amp; Me</title>
    <desc lang="en">The Devil Wears Prada director David Frankel's light comedy drama - based on a best-selling autobiography - stars Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston as a pair of married journalists who welcome a truly unruly dog into their lives. Relocating to Florida, newlyweds John and Jenny Grogan (Wilson and Aniston) end up working for rival newspapers, and it's soon obvious that Jenny has landed the more high-profile job. But when she starts to become broody, one of John's colleagues suggests they see how they cope with a puppy before trying for a baby. John duly picks a cute yellow Labrador retriever as a gift for his spouse. It's soon clear their acquisition is a double-edged sword: he's an untrainably anarchic source of destruction; but he also gives John the material for a wry newspaper column, which greatly increases his standing (and the paper's readership). The film follows the trajectory of the Grogans' marriage, through good times and bad, and the stuff of everyday life, with the dog providing comic relief and the leads turning in convincing, heart-warming performances(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">M. Night Shyamalan, the creative mind behind The Sixth Sense and Signs, wrote and directed this characteristically atmospheric thriller. The rustic village of Covington is a small town in rural Pennsylvania that is home to 60 souls. The citizens of Covington lead a quiet and peaceful life, but not without an unusual caveat -- terrible creatures lurk just outside the borders of the village, and the people of Covington have reached an agreement of sorts with the beasts, in which they are allowed to go about their business as long as they never cross the village's boundaries. However, this precarious balance is upset when a headstrong young man, Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix), decides to find out what lies outside Covington, and unwittingly invites the wrath of the creatures upon the town. The Village also stars Sigourney Weaver, William Hurt, Adrien Brody, Judy Greer, and Bryce Dallas Howard; both Kirsten Dunst and Ashton Kutcher were at one time attached to the project, but both left the cast before filming began(n)</desc>

Farrell's wanted by the FBI, but he's also potentially the only man who can help figure out the cyber criminals' next move. When the terrorists respond by kidnapping McClane's daughter Lucy, it's time for the anxious father to load up his ammo clips and go get the bad guys - just as the country's descending into chaos(n)</desc>

As the wave of self-destruction spreads, people naturally enough do their best to escape whatever it is that's causing it. Among them are Philadelphia science teacher Elliot Moore and his wife Alma, along with Mark's friend Julian and his daughter Jess. Their initial plans to flee to the state capital don't work out, so they take off to the countryside, where they think they'll be safe. But it's not long before they discover that they may have made a bad choice..(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Marley &amp; Me</title>
    <desc lang="en">The Devil Wears Prada director David Frankel's light comedy drama - based on a best-selling autobiography - stars Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston as a pair of married journalists who welcome a truly unruly dog into their lives. Relocating to Florida, newlyweds John and Jenny Grogan (Wilson and Aniston) end up working for rival newspapers, and it's soon obvious that Jenny has landed the more high-profile job. But when she starts to become broody, one of John's colleagues suggests they see how they cope with a puppy before trying for a baby. John duly picks a cute yellow Labrador retriever as a gift for his spouse. It's soon clear their acquisition is a double-edged sword: he's an untrainably anarchic source of destruction; but he also gives John the material for a wry newspaper column, which greatly increases his standing (and the paper's readership). The film follows the trajectory of the Grogans' marriage, through good times and bad, and the stuff of everyday life, with the dog providing comic relief and the leads turning in convincing, heart-warming performances(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Village</title>
    <desc lang="en">M. Night Shyamalan, the creative mind behind The Sixth Sense and Signs, wrote and directed this characteristically atmospheric thriller. The rustic village of Covington is a small town in rural Pennsylvania that is home to 60 souls. The citizens of Covington lead a quiet and peaceful life, but not without an unusual caveat -- terrible creatures lurk just outside the borders of the village, and the people of Covington have reached an agreement of sorts with the beasts, in which they are allowed to go about their business as long as they never cross the village's boundaries. However, this precarious balance is upset when a headstrong young man, Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix), decides to find out what lies outside Covington, and unwittingly invites the wrath of the creatures upon the town. The Village also stars Sigourney Weaver, William Hurt, Adrien Brody, Judy Greer, and Bryce Dallas Howard; both Kirsten Dunst and Ashton Kutcher were at one time attached to the project, but both left the cast before filming began(n)</desc>

When the terrorists respond by kidnapping McClane's daughter Lucy, it's time for the anxious father to load up his ammo clips and go get the bad guys - just as the country's descending into chaos(n)</desc>

He is forced to re-evaluate his opinion of these men, and of his own worth, when Internal Affairs officer Moe Tilden (Robert De Niro) comes to town and tries to recruit him into an investigation into their activities. Tilden is convincing, but the question remains, will the exhausted and self-loathing Heflin find the moral courage to battle the very people he has revered for so long, or will his apathy and world-weariness prove unconquerable? Either way, it will prove a difficult journey(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Fast Times at Ridgemont High</title>
    <desc lang="en">Back in the late 1970s, author Cameron Crowe banked upon his youthful appearance to pose as a teen-aged high school student. The results of his hands-on research was the revelatory book Fast Times at Ridgemont High, which went on to spectacular success as a theatrical feature. The sociological inner lining of Crowe's book was sacrificed in favor of standard teen-movie dialogue and Animal House-style comedy, but the film is impossible to dislike, and it spawned a legion of future imitators. Ostensibly, the main characters are brother and sister Jennifer Jason Leigh and Judge Reinhold. However, the real breakthrough star is Sean Penn as the perpetually zoned-out Jeff Spicoli. It is Penn who has the film's most famous scene, wherein the decorum of teacher Hand (Ray Walston)'s classroom is interrupted by a pizza delivery. Fast Times at Ridgemont High was spun off into a TV series, the short-lived 1986 weekly Fast Times(n)</desc>

Tilden is convincing, but the question remains, will the exhausted and self-loathing Heflin find the moral courage to battle the very people he has revered for so long, or will his apathy and world-weariness prove unconquerable? Either way, it will prove a difficult journey(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Fast Times at Ridgemont High</title>
    <desc lang="en">Back in the late 1970s, author Cameron Crowe banked upon his youthful appearance to pose as a teen-aged high school student. The results of his hands-on research was the revelatory book Fast Times at Ridgemont High, which went on to spectacular success as a theatrical feature. The sociological inner lining of Crowe's book was sacrificed in favor of standard teen-movie dialogue and Animal House-style comedy, but the film is impossible to dislike, and it spawned a legion of future imitators. Ostensibly, the main characters are brother and sister Jennifer Jason Leigh and Judge Reinhold. However, the real breakthrough star is Sean Penn as the perpetually zoned-out Jeff Spicoli. It is Penn who has the film's most famous scene, wherein the decorum of teacher Hand (Ray Walston)'s classroom is interrupted by a pizza delivery. Fast Times at Ridgemont High was spun off into a TV series, the short-lived 1986 weekly Fast Times(n)</desc>

Sinbad (voice of Brad Pitt) and his crews of pirate adventurers are hoping to retire to Fiji, and they discover a treasure that could make that possible -- the Book of Peace, which has kept the Twelve Cities in harmony for centuries. But Sinbad's plan to snatch the magic book is complicated when he learns it's on board a ship captained by his longtime friend Proteus (voice of Joseph Fiennes). While Sinbad still has his eye on the book, so does the mischievous goddess Eris (voice of Michelle Pfeifer), who sends a deadly sea monster into Sinbad's path to scuttle his plans. With the help of Proteus, Sinbad prevails over the beast, and determined Eris responds by snatching the book and framing Sinbad for the crime. Noble Proteus offers to step in for Sinbad and take his punishment, so now the adventurer has ten days to rescue the book from Eris or Proteus will pay with his life. While Sinbad is at first uncertain if he should take on such a dangerous assignment or simply high-tail it to Fiji, someone is on hand to persuade him -- Marina (voice of Catherine Zeta-Jones), Proteus' lovely but hard-headed fiancée, who has stowed away on Sinbad's ship. Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas was the first animated feature written by John Logan, who received an Oscar nomination for his script for Gladiator(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This adaptation of Christina Bartolomeo's novel Cupid and Diana was produced for the award-winning anthology series Hallmark Hall of Fame. Cate DeAngelo (Mary Louise Parker) is the misfit youngest daughter in a dysfunctional Irish/Italian family; her mother recently died, and her father Dominic (Philip Bosco) has never had much use for her. Cate gets along only a bit better with her sisters, fussbudget Francesca (Bebe Neuwirth) and straight-laced Cynthia (Joanna Going). Cate runs a vintage clothing boutique that isn't doing much business, and her relationship with her boyfriend Philip (David Lansbury) is pleasant but passionless. When she meets Harry (Peter Gallagher), a rumpled but charming lawyer from New York, Cate thinks she may have finally found the man she's been looking for all her life -- except he seems like a less attractive package than Philip, and her family is sure she's making a mistake. Cupid &amp; Cate first aired on May 7, 2000(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Toda idea comienza con una chispa, pero algunas crecen y logran cambiar al mundo. La necesidad es la madre de la invención. Desde la oscuridad el hombre busca la luz y comienza usando una simple vela; de un lugar alguien quiere comunicarse a la distancia y nace la idea del teléfono. Pero algunos inventos transformaron la vida más allá de nuestros hogares: la máquina a vapor, el telescopio, y el internet todo cambia nuestra vida. En esta cuenta regresiva veremos como la inventiva llega de todas formas y maneras. Algunos nacieron con un sencillo uso, como el martillo, mientras que otros desafiaron los límites que no creían posibles, como el avión. Pero sin importar el porcentaje de inspiración o transpiración por cada invento, nos han cambiado la vida para siempre(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Nuestra vida está tan llena de cosas hoy en día, que es muy facil de restarles importancia. Pero cuando el destino y la historia se combinan, hasta el objeto más sencillo, se infunde de relevancia histórica. Un trocito de roca es solamente eso hasta que nos dicen que es de la Luna, y entonces, se convierte en un salto para la humanidad. Una guitarra es solamente una guitarra pero si nos dicen que es tocando una guitarra que pertenecía a Jimmy Hendrix, entonces estas tocando una generación, no a una caja de madera con cuerdas . Algunos objetos son únicos en su especie (la máscara mortuória del Rey Tutankhamen) y otros son universales (un anillo de bodas), y todos nos afectan muy personalmente a cada quien. Son símbolos y sin ellos, definitivamente el mundo no sería el mismo(n)</desc>

With unprecedented access inside prison walls, it discovers what it's like to live with the threat of the death chamber, as well as hearing from victims and their families, and the family of those on death row - some praying for execution, some hoping for a reprieve. Each episode focuses on a key aspect of the system - execution, trial and appeal. The final film of the series follows 25-year-old legal student Kelly Hickman as she attempts to save two of the young killers facing execution in America. Kelly volunteers at the University of Houston Death Penalty Clinic, a team of Texan students who help mount last-ditch legal appeals for killers on Death Row. The team are working on two 'crisis cases' - cases where all of the offenders' normal legal appeals have failed and they are now just weeks away from execution(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="hr">Da nesreća nikad ne dolazi sama, kao i da se strah javlja tamo gdje ga najmanje očekujemo, pokazuje nam ovaj zanimljivi televizijski triler o ljudima koji su spremni na sve kako bi si osigurali bolju budućnost. Budu li je uopće doživjeli. Suočen s bankrotom, kapetan ribarskog broda iz Louisiane John Sanders (Lou Diamond Phillips) se uz pomoć vjernog pomoćnika Emeryja Broussarda (Rob Boltin) odlučuje na povratak na njihov prvotni posao, potragu i crpljenje podvodnog ulja. Sandersova bivša supruga Kelli (Kristy Swanson) ponudi im velik novac za pomoć pri traženju ogromnog nalazišta pod rijekom Atchafalaya. Istovremeno, policijski načelnik Dale Landry (Dennis Haskins) istražuje dojave očevidaca o opasnom morskom psu koji sije smrt i strah po istoj rijeci, kao i pojavu opasnih kriminalaca predvođenih nemilosrdnim Iceom (Coolio) koji traži davno skriveni novac. Različiti planovi svih tih skupina cijelo će se vrijeme ispreplitati, do krvave završnice. "Crvena rijeka" iznimno je uzbudljiv triler redatelja Charlesa Roberta Carnera, koji je u žanrovsku matricu spretno uklopio i tragove drugih filmskih vrsta, kao što su horor o zastrašujućem prirodnom neprijatelju i avanturistički film potrage, ali i obiteljska drama, koja se očituje u odnosu kapetana Sandersa i njegove bivše supruge. Uz odličnog Loua Diamonda Phillipsa ("La Bamba") u glavnoj ulozi, ekipu upotpunjuje cijeli niz poznatih filmskih i televizijskih lica, ali najdojmljiviji nastup je ostvario glazbenik, slavni reper Coolio(n)</desc>

Suočen s bankrotom, kapetan ribarskog broda iz Louisiane John Sanders (Lou Diamond Phillips) se uz pomoć vjernog pomoćnika Emeryja Broussarda (Rob Boltin) odlučuje na povratak na njihov prvotni posao, potragu i crpljenje podvodnog ulja. Sandersova bivša supruga Kelli (Kristy Swanson) ponudi im velik novac za pomoć pri traženju ogromnog nalazišta pod rijekom Atchafalaya. Istovremeno, policijski načelnik Dale Landry (Dennis Haskins) istražuje dojave očevidaca o opasnom morskom psu koji sije smrt i strah po istoj rijeci, kao i pojavu opasnih kriminalaca predvođenih nemilosrdnim Iceom (Coolio) koji traži davno skriveni novac. Različiti planovi svih tih skupina cijelo će se vrijeme ispreplitati, do krvave završnice. "Crvena rijeka" iznimno je uzbudljiv triler redatelja Charlesa Roberta Carnera, koji je u žanrovsku matricu spretno uklopio i tragove drugih filmskih vrsta, kao što su horor o zastrašujućem prirodnom neprijatelju i avanturistički film potrage, ali i obiteljska drama, koja se očituje u odnosu kapetana Sandersa i njegove bivše supruge. Uz odličnog Loua Diamonda Phillipsa ("La Bamba") u glavnoj ulozi, ekipu upotpunjuje cijeli niz poznatih filmskih i televizijskih lica, ali najdojmljiviji nastup je ostvario glazbenik, slavni reper Coolio(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The concluding edition of this two-part docu-drama looks at how Shipman covered his tracks and examines the unravelling of decades of lies that subsequently led to his conviction.

It was the subsequent death of Kathleen Grundy that triggered his downfall, and her daughter and son-in-law Angela and Phil Woodruff describe their reactions when they discovered that Shipman was bizarrely the sole benefactor of Kathleen's estate.(n)</desc>

Among the developments that Lee is trying to obscure from view: the film's eccentric director (Christopher Walken) has essentially hijacked the $87 million movie and isn't allowing anyone to view it. Also, the film's high-profile, real-life married co-stars Gwen Harrison (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Eddie Thomas (John Cusack) have acrimoniously split since filming (over Gwen's adulterous affair with Latin lover Hector (Hank Azaria). Lee has led the press to believe that reconciliation is imminent, when in fact Gwen hates Eddie more than ever. Lee's secret weapon in his campaign of misinformation is Gwen's long-abused sister Kiki (Julia Roberts), who works as the pampered star's personal assistant while secretly pining for Eddie, who might just notice Kiki now that she's lost 60 pounds.

    <desc lang="en">David Lynch's Oscar-nominated FilmFour-funded film, based on a true story, stars the late Richard Farnsworth as Alvin Straight. Alvin learns his brother is dying and wants to see him one more time. But he can't afford the air fare and he doesn't have a car. What he has is a tractor-mower that he decides to drive the 300 miles to Wisconsin. The film simply documents his painfully slow progress, the people he meets and the adventures he has but does so with loving care, slowly bringing out Alvin's character but showing along the way how he too brings out the best in those he meets. Unique, superlative filmmaking, stunningly shot by Freddie Francis(n)</desc>

Alvin learns his brother is dying and wants to see him one more time. But he can't afford the air fare and he doesn't have a car. What he has is a tractor-mower that he decides to drive the 300 miles to Wisconsin. The film simply documents his painfully slow progress, the people he meets and the adventures he has but does so with loving care, slowly bringing out Alvin's character but showing along the way how he too brings out the best in those he meets. Unique, superlative filmmaking, stunningly shot by Freddie Francis(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Hesher</title>
    <desc lang="en">A bullied little boy grieving the death of his mother strikes up an unlikely friendship with a Metallica-loving anarchist in this tender yet unsentimental childhood drama. In the wake of his mother's recent death, 13-year-old TJ (Devin Brochu) finds the bumpy road to emotional recovery all the more difficult due to the dual facts that he's bullied at school and that his father (Rainn Wilson) has become a vacant pill-head. Just when it seems like things couldn't possibly get any worse, TJ strikes up an unusual friendship with Hesher (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a greasy-haired anarchist with a beat-up van, homemade tattoos, and a soft spot for explosions. The next thing TJ knows, Hesher is sitting in his living room and watching porn on the family television. Later, though, just as TJ summons the courage to pursue a friendship with Nicole (Natalie Portman), a kindly grocery-store clerk who came to his aid in a time of need, an explosive discovery threatens to propel the embattled teen down a dangerous path of self-destruction(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">One of the toughest and best-remembered sports movies of the 1970s gets a humorous makeover in this comedy. Paul "Wrecking" Crewe (Adam Sandler) was once a famous professional football player, but after several years out of the limelight and an alcohol problem have taken their toll, Crewe is arrested for a serious traffic accident aggravated by the fact he was drunk. Crewe is sentenced to Allenville Penitentiary, where Warden Hazen (James Cromwell) is something of a football fan. Hazen had organized his guards into an impressive football team, and clears a healthy profit by taking bets on their games. Looking to make the competition more interesting, Hazen suggests that Crewe put together a team from the inmate population to play his guards. With the help of fellow prisoner Caretaker (Chris Rock), Crewe recruits the heaviest hitters from the cell block for the team, but the guys don't play like a unit until Crewe and Caretaker get some help from Nate Scarborough (Burt Reynolds), a former college and NFL coach doing hard time. Adapted from Robert Aldrich's 1974 box-office smash of the same name, The Longest Yard also features rap star Nelly and Nicholas Turturro; the film has previously been loosely remade in 2001 as Mean Machine, with the action moved to England and the game changed to soccer(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Friends With Money</title>
    <desc lang="en">A single woman envies the security of her married friends, while they in turn dream of her freedom in this comedy drama. Olivia (Jennifer Aniston) is a single woman in her mid-thirties who feels she's reached a crossroads in her life. Unhappy with her career as a teacher, Olivia quits and takes a job as a maid until she sorts out her feelings. However, Olivia feels as if she could use some support, both personal and financial, from her best friends, all of whom at very least have more in the bank than she does. But that's not to say they don't have problems of their own. Christine (Catherine Keener) and her husband Patrick (Jason Isaacs) are screenwriters who have discovered that collaborating is more stress than they can deal with. Jane (Frances McDormand) is married to Aaron (Simon McBurney); they work together as designers, but while their professional relationship is cordial, they've become numb to one another as lovers and friends. And Franny (Joan Cusack) and Matt (Greg Germann) are a couple who comfortably support themselves and their children thanks to an inherited fortune; while their material needs are met, emotionally they can barely handle marriage and parenthood. Friends With Money was written and directed by Nicole Holofcener, who previously made the acclaimed independent features Walking and Talking and Lovely &amp; Amazing(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Moulin Rouge</title>
    <desc lang="en">The third film from pop-music-obsessed director Baz Luhrmann tweaks the conventions of the musical genre by mixing a period romance with anachronistic dialogue and songs in the style of his previous Romeo+Juliet (1996). Ewan McGregor stars as Christian, who leaves behind his bourgeois father during the French belle époque of the late 1890s to seek his fortunes in the bohemian underworld of Montmartre, Paris. Christian meets the absinthe- and alcohol-addicted artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo), who introduces him to a world of sex, drugs, music, theater, and the scandalous dance known as the cancan, all at the Moulin Rouge, a decadent dance hall, brothel, and theater that's the brainchild of Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent). Christian also meets and falls into a tragically doomed romance with the courtesan Satine (Nicole Kidman), who becomes the star of the play he's writing, which parallels the couple's romance and utilizes rock music from a century later, including songs by Nirvana, Madonna, the Beatles, and Queen, among others. Loosely based on the opera +Orpheus in the Underworld, Moulin Rouge was shown in competition at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival(n)</desc>

Alex (Allen Covert) is a 35-year-old video-game fanatic who gave up a career in accounting to take a job testing games for Brainasium, the company behind the wildly popular game "Eternal Death Slayer." While Alex took a big pay cut to land his dream job, he's happy with his work and is making ends meet -- until he discovers that his roommate hasn't paid the rent for the last six months, using the money to finance repeated visits to a local massage parlor. After running out of friends who will let him sleep on their couch, Alex swallows his pride and moves in with his grandma Lily (Doris Roberts), who loves Alex and is happy to give him a place to stay in exchange for doing chores around the house. Lily shares her home with two friends, perpetually confused Bea (Shirley Knight) and sexually adventurous Grace (Shirley Jones), and between the three of them, there's always work to be done, keeping Alex busy nearly every night. While Alex tells his co-workers he's living with three attractive women who are running him ragged, they don't know the real story; in the meantime, Alex is trying to charm Brainasium's beautiful new executive, Samantha (Linda Cardellini), while butting heads with the firm's space-case CEO Cheezle (Kevin Nealon) and J.P. (Joel David Moore), a teenage game designer who is no longer in touch with reality. Grandma's Boy was the first feature film from director Nicholaus Goossen(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Nat King Cole: Afraid of the Dark</title>
    <desc lang="en">Documentary about crooner Nat King Cole. He was the only black TV star in Hollywood at a time when America groaned under the weight of racial segregation and prejudice, yet he possessed a natural talent so great that these issues were seemingly swept to one side to allow him to become one of the greatest jazz icons of all time. However, behind closed doors those around him were trying to think of a way to package him as something he was not: bi-white. This candid account of what really happened in and around his 'fairytale' life is taken from his private journals, interviews with his widow Maria and contributions from other family members, Tony Bennett, Buddy Greco, Harry Belafonte, Nancy Wilson, Sir Bruce Forsyth, George Benson, Aaron Neville, Johnny Mathis and many more. Featuring archive never seen before, it reveals Cole's feelings behind his ultimate calling as a 'beacon of hope' to the legions of the oppressed(n)</desc>

Talbert produces, writes, and directs this urban crime comedy concerning a pair of criminals who take a group of church parishioners hostage while attempting to rob the holy house, only to find their captives slowly convincing them to repent and give up their lawless lifestyles. Durell (Ice Cube) and LeeJohn (Tracy Morgan) are two best friends with a special knack for petty crime. Upset at discovering that his ex-girlfriend is planning to move out of state with the couple's young son, Durell knows that the only way to keep his fractured family in close proximity to one another is to raise the 17,000 dollars needed to pay off her growing debt. In order to get the money before his ex decides to make the big move, the desperate Durell enlists the aid of his scheming best buddy to rob their neighborhood church. But someone has beaten Durell and LeeJohn to the punch, and if they ever hope to get their hands on that quick cash, this bumbling pair will first have to spend an entire night in the presence of not just the almighty lord, but some of his most fervent followers as well.

On the eve of the coronation of 12-year-old Romulus Augustus, barbarian general Odoacer arrives in Rome to make demands in exchange for his years supporting the Roman legions in the east. But when he is refused, the barbarian army storms the city. Romulus is captured and taken to the island fortress of Capri. The Byzantine Empire initially offer the boy emperor sanctuary but they later betray him and join forces with Odoacer's army of Goths. Faced with treason, Romulus and his allies must set off in search of the one legion in the Empire that is still loyal to him - the Ninth in Britannia(n)</desc>

Lake Victoria may look peaceful, but beneath the placid waters of this painterly lake lurks a deadly menace. A powerful underwater tremor has released scores of man-eating prehistoric fish into the waters, and now it's up to a group of unlikely heroes to band together and defeat the razor-toothed predators. With time running out and the aquatic carnivores taking over, one brave heroine (Elisabeth Shue) will risk everything to save the lake and prevent her family from becoming fish food.

Originally titled "Nobody Here but Us Martians," this darkly comic Twilight Zone episode was a rewrite of (and vast improvement upon) an unfilmed Rod Serling script from 1958, "The Night of the Big Rain." Having spotted what they think is a UFO, two highway patrolmen converge upon a roadside diner, where an interesting cross-section of humanity has gathered. The patrolmen plant the suggestion that one of the patrons is actually a "spy" from another planet, a suggestion scoffed at by such likely suspects as taciturn Mr. Ross (John Hoyt) and scraggly vagabond Avery (Jack Elam). The check-checkmate ending is one of the series' most memorable, thanks to the skillful underplaying of Barney Phillips as the diner's sarcastic counterman. "Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up?" first aired May 26, 1961(n)</desc>

Awakening with "the grandaddy of all hangovers," David Gurney (Richard Long) is not amused when his wife Wilma (Shirley Ballard) emits a scream and insists that she'd never set eyes on David before. As the day progresses, it turns out that no one recognizes David, nor is their any record of his ever having existed -- and as a result of his "ravings," he is placed in a mental institution. Is David really crazy, or is his loss of identity merely a bad dream? Well. . .best to stick around until the very, very last scene. Written by Charles Beaumont, "Person or Persons Unknown" made its Twilight Zone bow on March 23, 1962(n)</desc>

While shopping in a big department store, Marsha White (Anne Francis) is inexorably drawn to the store's Ninth Floor, where a mysterious saleswoman (Elizabeth Allen) seems to recognize her. There's just one problem -- according to officious floorwalker Armbruster (James Milhollin), the store doesn't have a Ninth Floor!

    <desc lang="en">The Invaders. Written by Richard Matheson, this is one of those classic Twilight Zone episodes that has remained in the collective memory long after other lesser episodes (and lesser anthologies) have been forgotten. The action takes place at a remote farmhouse, where a soil-stained farm woman (Agnes Moorehead) is forced to defend herself from a tiny spaceship and its equally diminutive occupants. Except for the final scene, the episode is entirely bereft of dialogue, affording Moorehead the opportunity to deliver a bravura pantomime performance. Originally telecast January 27, 1961, "The Invaders" was selected as the final Twilight Zone rerun of the 1961-62 season -- which at the time was assumed to be the series' very last installment(n)</desc>

Arriving on a strange planet, Earth astronauts Peter Craig (Joe Maross) and William Fletcher (Claude Akins) stumble upon a microscopic city populated by teeny tiny people. While Fletcher seeks only to befriend the local citizens, the arrogant, power-hungry Craig is perfectly content to be worshipped as a god. Ordering Fletcher back into the spaceship, Craig stays behind, looking forward to a long and fruitful reign over the little people. . .a reign that comes to an abrupt end in a most ironic fashion.

    <desc lang="en">And When the Sky Was Opened. Richard Matheson was first represented on the Twilight Zone with the December 11, 1959 episode "And When the Sky Was Opened," adapted by Rod Serling from Matheson's short story "Disappearing Act." After an experimental space flight crash-lands, the three crew members -- who have miraculously survived -- begin experiencing strange sensations. As the episode develops, it becomes obvious that no one but the crewmen have any memory of the crash. . .and before long, no one has any memory whatsoever of the crew itself! This tricky, complex set-up was brilliantly handled by director Douglas Heyes (making his own Twilight Zone debut) and by a topnotch cast, including Rod Taylor, Jim Hutton, and Charles Aidman as the benighted astronauts (also, keep an eye out for Sue Randall, aka "Miss Landers" on Leave It to Beaver(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Eye of the Beholder</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Eye of the Beholder. An irreducable masterpiece, the Rod Serling-scripted Twilight Zone episode "The Eye of the Beholder" takes place in a hospital in the dead of night. The protagonist is Janet Tyler, who, having been shunned by society because of her hideous ugliness, has just undergone extensive plastic surgery. Knowing full well that she will be shipped off to a community of fellow "outcasts" if the surgery is unsuccessful, Janet tensely awaits the results as the bandages are slowly removed from her face. Even after repeated viewings, this landmark episode loses none of his power and poignancy, with Douglas Heyes' surehanded direction matched by Bernard Herrmann's brilliant musical score. First telecast November 11, 1960, "The Eye of the Beholder" was rerun in the summer of 1962 -- when, to avoid tipping off the punch line, the episode reverted to its working title, "A Private World of Darkness."(n)</desc>

In the original radio version, the protagonist was a young man named Ronald Adams, played by Orson Welles. Deducing that TV viewers would be more emotionally affected by a woman in distress, Serling rewrote the main character as Nan Adams, with Inger Stevens filling the role. While making a cross-country motor trip, Nan is terrified by the repeated appearances of a shabby-looking hitchhiker (Leonard Strong) who shows up at every turn and who seems to be beckoning her to. . .what?

Cliff Robertson stars as Jerry Etherson, a nightclub ventriloquist with a predilection for liquor and emotional problems. Weighing heavily upon Jerry is the fact that he feels threatened by his dummy Willy -- as well he should, since Willy seems to be doing all his talking on his own. Hoping to rid himself of his little nemesis, Jerry adopts a new wooden companion, Goofy Goggles, but Willy isn't about to be dismissed so easily. The supporting cast features future Gomer Pyle USMC regular Frank Sutton and perennial starlet Edy Williams.

    <desc lang="en">Dead Man Dating. It is nothing unusual when impressionable Piper (Holly Marie Combs) falls in love again. What is out of the ordinary is that Piper's new beau, Mark (John Cho), is the ghost of a murder victim, who hopes not only to avenge his death but to arrange his own funeral before his body can be "claimed" by demonic forces. Elsewhere, the peripatetic Phoebe (Alyssa Milano) hopes to use her forecasting skills to good use -- and make big money in the bargain -- by going to work for a psychic. And while preparing for her birthday, Prue (Shannen Doherty) is laid low by a crushing disillusionment. Fans of the series (and even non-fans!) will certainly appreciate the scene in which co-star Alyssa Milano shows up in a fetching harem outfit(n)</desc>
