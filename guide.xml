    <desc lang="en">Light-hearted documentary shedding light on the lives of people whose extravagant tastes often leave their parents or significant others substantially out of pocket. These so-called `divas' are more than willing to throw tantrums, manipulate relatives and resort to emotional blackmail to get what they want. Among the pampered persons highlighted are shopping-obsessive Janey, who withholds sex from her fiance as a means of getting access to his bank account, and ambitious teen Romy, who demands her mother supply her with a `big budget' wardrobe to match her big dreams. Also featured is apprentice hairdresser Matthew, who plans to emulate the camp excess of Lady Gaga as a performer, much to the dismay of long-suffering boyfriend Dylan.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Rob Brydon hosts a festive edition of the comedy panel show, in which team captains David Mitchell and Lee Mack are joined by Richard Osman, Tom Courtenay, Sara Pascoe and Chris Kamara. As usual, all participants will be hoping to deceive one another with plausible lies, such as Richard stating he has never seen Breaking Bad because of his Homes Under the Hammer addiction, Sir Tom claiming he enjoys whiskey on his Christmas morning cornflakes, and Chris explaining that his full name is actually Christmas Kamara. The team also takes a somewhat unusual take on the Nativity.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Ellie Harrison visits Thirsk in North Yorkshire to celebrate the centenary of James Herriot, arguably the world's most famous vet. Known as Alf Wight to his family and friends, his semi-autobiographical accounts of his work - which began with the publication of All Creatures Great and Small in 1972 - won him an international fanbase, and inspired many youngsters in the 1970s and 1980s to become vets themselves. Here, Ellie meets Wight's son and daughter, and the vets that run his practice today. She also meets Christopher Timothy, the actor who played the part of Herriot in the BBC's adaptation of All Creatures Great and Small, and revisits classic moments from the Countryfile archive that highlight the work of people who have dedicated their time to helping animals. Including Weather for the Week Ahead.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Legally Blonde 2: Red, White &amp; Blonde</title>
    <desc lang="en">Taking home a paycheck that nearly rivals the budget of the first film, Reese Witherspoon reprises the role of Elle Woods in this sequel to 2001's surprise blockbuster Legally Blonde. When she's fired from her job at an upscale law firm for voicing her stance against the testing of cosmetics on animals, Elle heads to Capitol Hill to fight for her cause before Congress, leaving her boyfriend, Emmett (Luke Wilson, reprising his role from the film's predecessor), behind. Once there, she runs into plenty of adversity and red-tape and can't seem to find anyone who will listen to her proposals. While staying at the Watergate hotel though, she meets and befriends an elderly bellman (Bob Newhart in his first theatrical role since 1997's In &amp; Out) who's been around politicians long enough to know the ins and outs of the political machine. With his help, Elle attempts to convince disillusioned U.S. Representative Rudd (Sally Field) to help her get her voice heard in front of the stodgy old coots of the legislative branch. Directed by Charles Herman-Wurmfeld hot off the success of his critically acclaimed indie comedy Kissing Jessica Stein, Legally Blonde 2: Red, White and Blonde boasts a supporting cast led by Jennifer Coolidge (Best in Show, American Pie) and Regina King (Jerry Maguire, Daddy Day Care)(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Documentary following the progress of artistic director Ake Larson and architect Arne Bergh as they embark on a six-week project to build Icehotel, a sophisticated structure constructed in the Swedish village of Jukkasjarvi - more than 120 miles inside the Arctic Circle. The venue has been built from snow and ice every year since 1990, when an edifice housing an exhibition of ice sculptures became a temporary hostel for visiting art enthusiasts. However, an unseasonable heatwave in the middle of the build leaves the team struggling to complete the construction in time to accommodate paying guests.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">American Pie</title>
    <desc lang="en">It's said that most American men think about sex once every two or three minutes, but this statistic would seriously underestimate the horniness of Jim (Jason Biggs), a high school senior in suburban Michigan. Jim is thoroughly obsessed with sex, a fact of which his parents become aware when they discover him performing the sin of Onan with a gym sock while watching scrambled pay-per-view porn. Jim's buddies Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), and Oz (Chris Klein) are no less anxious to relieve themselves of their virginity, so they all make a pledge: they will go to bed with a woman in the three weeks before senior prom or die trying. Kevin appears to have the advantage, since he already has a girlfriend, Vicky (Tara Reid), but before he ventures into the Final Frontier, Kevin is urged to consult "The Bible," a hand-written how-to manual possessing erotic wisdom passed down through the ages. Oz is a good-looking jock who is actually a nice guy -- which is part of the problem, since he has his heart set on a nice girl, Heather (Mena Suvari), who does not seem the type to leap into bed within 21 days. Finch has no immediate prospects, though Jessica (Natasha Lyonne) is in a position to know if those rumors about him are true. And Jim is a truly hopeless case -- after his attempted seduction of beautiful Czech exchange student Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) turns out to be a disaster, he ends up going to the prom with Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), an annoyingly chatty band geek who does, however, have a fascinating story about a flute. American Pie was the directorial debut of Paul Weitz, who, along with his brother Chris Weitz (who served as producer), previously wrote several screenplays, including Antz and Madeline (where they presumably worked all their wholesome ideas out of their system)(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">American Pie</title>
    <desc lang="en">It's said that most American men think about sex once every two or three minutes, but this statistic would seriously underestimate the horniness of Jim (Jason Biggs), a high school senior in suburban Michigan. Jim is thoroughly obsessed with sex, a fact of which his parents become aware when they discover him performing the sin of Onan with a gym sock while watching scrambled pay-per-view porn. Jim's buddies Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), and Oz (Chris Klein) are no less anxious to relieve themselves of their virginity, so they all make a pledge: they will go to bed with a woman in the three weeks before senior prom or die trying. Kevin appears to have the advantage, since he already has a girlfriend, Vicky (Tara Reid), but before he ventures into the Final Frontier, Kevin is urged to consult "The Bible," a hand-written how-to manual possessing erotic wisdom passed down through the ages. Oz is a good-looking jock who is actually a nice guy -- which is part of the problem, since he has his heart set on a nice girl, Heather (Mena Suvari), who does not seem the type to leap into bed within 21 days. Finch has no immediate prospects, though Jessica (Natasha Lyonne) is in a position to know if those rumors about him are true. And Jim is a truly hopeless case -- after his attempted seduction of beautiful Czech exchange student Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) turns out to be a disaster, he ends up going to the prom with Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), an annoyingly chatty band geek who does, however, have a fascinating story about a flute. American Pie was the directorial debut of Paul Weitz, who, along with his brother Chris Weitz (who served as producer), previously wrote several screenplays, including Antz and Madeline (where they presumably worked all their wholesome ideas out of their system)(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Tutankhamun: The Truth Uncovered</title>
    <desc lang="en">What killed Tutankhamun? Ever since the tomb of the boy king was discovered in 1922, he has become arguably the most famous pharaoh of all ancient Egypt. But his mysterious death at just 19 years of age has never been explained. Now, Dallas Campbell reveals new scientific research aimed at getting to the truth. A CT scan of the pharaoh's mummified body creates a full-size image of the real Tutankhamun, while DNA analysis uncovers a shocking secret about his family background - and the genetic trail leads to a revolutionary new theory about his sudden and unexpected death.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">It's Christmas time in Poplar and love is in the air as Jenny's relationship with Alec continues to blossom, while Shelagh is planning her quiet wedding to Dr Turner. However, the peace is suddenly disturbed when the police arrive at Nonnatus House to announce an unexploded bomb has been discovered just around the corner and everybody in the district is being evacuated to safety. The electricity has been cut off and the streets are pitch-black, and with the locals scurrying to safety, the nuns and nurses reach out to anyone in need of medical help. The spirit of the Blitz takes over as the community's members pull together - aware that, at any moment, their homes could be reduced to rubble. Jessica Raine, Jenny Agutter, Pam Ferris and Laura Main star in a festive special of the 1950s-set drama, with a guest appearance by comedian Sandi Toksvig.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">A League of Their Own</title>
    <desc lang="en">The All-American Girls' Professional Baseball League was founded in 1943, when most of the men of baseball-playing age were far away in Europe and Asia fighting World War II. The league flourished until after World War II, when, with the men's return, the league was consigned to oblivion. Director Penny Marshall and screenwriters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel re-create the wartime era when women's baseball looked to stand a good chance of sweeping the country. The story begins as a candy-bar tycoon enlists agents to scour the country to find women who could play ball. In the backwoods of Oregon, two sisters -- Dottie (Geena Davis) and Kit (Lori Petty) -- are discovered. Dottie can hit and catch, while Kit can throw a mean fastball. The girls come to Chicago to try out for the team with other prospects that include their soon-to-be-teammates Mae Mordabito (Madonna), Doris Murphy (Rosie O'Donnell), and Marla Hooch (Megan Cavanagh). The team's owner, Walter Harvey (Gary Marshall) needs someone to coach his team and he picks one-time home-run champion Jimmy Dugan (Tom Hanks), who is now a broken-down alcoholic. After a few weeks of training, as Dugan sobers up, the team begins to show some promise. By the end of the season, the team has improved to the point where they are competing in the World Series (which is no big deal, since there are only four teams in the league)(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Perfect Holiday</title>
    <desc lang="en">Gabrielle Union, Morris Chestnut, Queen Latifah, and Terrence Howard star in a film concerning a young girl who implores a department-store Santa to find a new husband for her divorced mother for Christmas. Single mother of three Nancy (Union) has been putting the needs of her three children ahead of her own for as far back as she can remember, and lately her youngest daughter, Emily (Khail Bryant), has become acutely aware of her mother's palpable sadness. As Christmas draws near, Nancy takes her kids to the mall for a cheerful visit with jolly old Saint Nick. When it comes time for Emily's turn to sit on Santa's lap and make her Christmas wish, she selflessly remembers her mother's recent comment that a compliment from a man would be the best gift of all. Determined to make her mother happy again even if it means sacrificing her own wish, Emily relays the message to Santa (Chestnut), not realizing that the man beneath the beard is actually an office-supply salesman and ambitious singer/songwriter named Benjamin. Recognizing the daughter's love for her mother and sensing something truly special in Nancy, Benjamin cheerfully obliges the young girl, setting into motion a series of events that promise to make this the most memorable holiday in quite some time. Lance Rivera directs a film produced by Shakim Compere and Latifah through Flavor Unit Entertainment(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In the third installment of the series that began with The Prophecy, the Angel Gabriel (Christopher Walken) has taken up residence on Earth, where he's learned to enjoy the simple pleasures of life among humans, such as frosted doughnuts and driving a convertible. One night, he witnesses Danyael (Dave Buzzotta), a heretic preacher with a storefront church who tells his flock that God doesn't care much for the people who tend the Earth. A blind man (Brad Dourif) who claims to hear the voice of God shoots Danyael several times in the chest. However, several hours after he's pronounced dead, Danyael rises from his slab at the morgue and heads out into the street. Maggie (Kayren Ann Butler), his understandably upset girlfriend, is then approached by Zouhael (Vincent Spano), a fallen angel who needs Danyael for his own evil purposes. It seems that Danyael is half human and half angel, and both Gabriel and Zouhael want his help. A Spirit of genocide and destruction is about to rise on a Native American reservation, and if Gabriel is going to stop it -- or Zouhael is going to bring it forward -- they will need Danyael's guidance. Prophecy 3: The Ascent marked the directorial debut of Patrick Lussier, who has often worked as an editor for horror director Wes Craven(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment. One morning Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) notices that his neighbor Ned Flanders (voice of Harry Shearing) is angrily shooing a man off of his property. Wondering what's going on, Homer learns that the man is an installer from a local cable TV service (voice of Phil Hartman) who offered to give Ned an illegal cable hook-up in exchange for a one-time, under-the-table payment. Lacking Ned's scruples, Homer asks the installer to give him a hook-up, and soon the Simpsons are basking in the glow of free cable programming. But after Reverend Lovejoy (also voiced by Shearer) gives a sermon on the evils of theft, Lisa begins having qualms about the ethics of stealing cable, and announces she'll no longer watch TV with the family unless they start paying for their cable service. Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) also wonders if having free cable is such a good idea, especially after she discovers Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright) is charging his classmates to watch softcore adult movies shown on the "Top Hat" cable network. Lisa decides to stage a vigil outside the Simpson home to protest Homer's actions, just as he's invited over all of his friends to watch a championship boxing match on a pay channel he's receiving illegally. Phil Hartman also provides the voice of Moses in a biblical flashback sequence. "Homer Vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment" was first aired on February 7, 1991(n)</desc>

A team of inspectors from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission make an unannounced visit at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, and several employees are tested to see how they would deal with an emergency. Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) proves to astoundingly inept, bringing the test's phony plant to the point of a meltdown, and Homer is ordered to return to school and pass a course in Nuclear Physics before he can return to his job. Homer enrolls in Springfield University after Mr. Burns (voice of Harry Shearer) intercedes on his behalf, but true to form, Homer's notion of academia seem to be informed more clearly by bad 1980s college comedies rather than the pursuit of higher learning. With his grades going steadily downhill, Homer is introduced to three science students who will be his tutors, Doug (voice of Hank Azaria), Gary (voice of Dan Castellaneta), and Ben (voice of Harry Shearer). Homer is more interested in teaching his nerdy new friends the fine art of partying rather than doing schoolwork, and after Homer talks them into stealing the mascot of crosstown rivals Springfield A&amp;M, Doug, Gary, and Ben are kicked out of school.

Baldwin and Basinger tell Homer they come to Springfield during time off to get away from the glare of Hollywood stardom; they ask him to keep their presence a secret, and star-struck Homer offers to serve as their personal assistant. Homer soon gets to know Alec and Kim's friend and frequent visitor Ron Howard, but it starts to wear on him that he's hanging out with folks from the Show Biz A List but can't tell anyone. One night, Homer blabs about his famous pals at Moe's Tavern, and soon all of Springfield knows about the celebrities in their midst. Baldwin and Basinger turn their back on Homer, and he in turn dishes dirt on his former friends by opening "Homer's Museum of Hollywood Jerks." "When You Dish Upon A Star" first aired on November 8, 1998; Alec Baldwin, Kim Basinger and Ron Howard provided the voices for their characters, as did noted producer Brian Grazer(n)</desc>

Max is his school's brainiest kid by a long way, but he's also the most difficult - and when he falls for one of his teachers, it spells trouble. Bill Murray co-stars as a parent who provides initial solace and then competition for our lovelorn hero.

What begins as a clash of wills, soon leads to unexpected romance as Van and Gwen both realize they have a lot to learn from each other.

    <title lang="en">Heartbreakers</title>
    <desc lang="en">After the little white lies of Romy and Michele's High School Reunion (1997), director David Mirkin focuses on scheming of a different sort in Heartbreakers. Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt play Max and Page Conners, a mother and daughter who share everything with each other: relationship advice, hair and makeup hints, and the money they win in costly divorce settlements with rich men. When the film opens, the Conners are putting the finishing touches on conning Dean (Ray Liotta), an auto-body shop owner. When the dust from that scam clears, Page announces she's ready to move away from her mother and set up shop on her own -- but in order to clear an outstanding debt, Max insists they bankrupt one more bachelor together. They settle upon phlegmatic Palm Springs widower William B. Tensy (Gene Hackman), a chain smoker with a heart of gold and a similarly bountiful bank account. Only two things stand in their way: Tensy's Teutonic caretaker Miss Madress (Nora Dunn) and beachfront bartender Jack (Jason Lee), a wry stargazer with whom Page becomes unexpectedly smitten. Heartbreakers is the third collaboration from writers Steven Mazur and Paul Guy, whose previous screwball comedy was 1997's international hit, Liar Liar(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Jane Fonda, Felicity Huffman, and Lindsay Lohan star in director Garry Marshall's tale of a rebellious young woman who is sent to spend the summer with her grandmother when her frustrated mother fails to find a means of curbing her unruly behavior. Rachel (Lohan) is an out-of-control teen whose reckless drinking, foul mouth, and hysterical fits have become a constant source of embarrassment for her long-suffering mother, Lily (Huffman). When Rachel crashes her car, Lily determines that the only way to tame her savage daughter is to take her as far away from San Francisco as possible. Though Lily had once sworn never to return to the Idaho farm presided over by her demanding mother, Georgia (Jane Fonda), desperation has a funny way of dulling the pains of the past, and it's not long before Lily is packing Rachel in the car and setting out for potato country. Contrary to the common image of the sweet and doting grandmother, Georgia is a stern matriarch whose beliefs in the power of God and a hard day's work stand in stark contrast to the carefree lifestyle of the tempestuous Rachel. An interesting thing happens as the summer wears on, though; despite her initial efforts to disrupt the quiet Mormon community, Rachel's rage is gradually tempered as she learns the value of structure and responsibility. Later, as Rachel's protective walls begin to crumble and she begins to embrace compassion and kindness, the doors are opened for three generations of family to confront the long-buried secrets of their past and finally move forward in the healing process(n)</desc>

Finally coming to grips with the fact that the mythical Jack Flack cannot help him this time, Thomas takes on the spies with the help of his schoolmates, who are also "Cloak and Dagger" addicts.

However, fate conspires against him when a massive snowstorm sweeps in and all flights are canceled. Porter suddenly has to deal with a number of stranded passengers, including six tween-age kids who are each flying unaccompanied from one divorced parent to another -- spoiled little rich girl Grace (Gina Mantegna), geeky but likable Spencer (Dyllan Christopher), his pesky little sister Katy (Dominique Saldana), plus-size comic book fan Beef (Brett Kelly), grumpy tomboy Donna (Quinn Shephard), and bright but mischievous Charlie (Tyler James Williams). With his hands full and determined to make his way to the islands, Porter puts his assistant Zach Van Bourke (Wilmer Valderrama) in charge of the kids. Zach doesn't care for this assignment and the kids don't care for him, and before long they've escaped from the basement conference room where he's stashed them and turned the airport into their playground.

Despite this inauspicious start, Cilla agrees to let him manage her, but will their arrangement still stand after her friends, a local band by the name of the Beatles, help her land an audition with genuine impresario Brian Epstein?

    <desc lang="en">Jim Cronin visits Turkey in search of Carli, the country's most famous primate, who appeared in the Jungle Book movie, and then his own TV series, in which he was trained to wear human clothes, kiss his leading ladies and deliver amusing antics right on cue. But his fame has led to an increase in the demand for pet monkeys, which in turn has meant an increase in the illegal trade of poaching and importing wild-caught chimps. Can Jim persuade Carli's owners to give up their money-spinning monkey for the safety of a new home in the UK?.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The broadcaster explores the Galapagos, a collection of volcanic islands in the Pacific known for its extraordinary wildlife. More than 150 years after Charles Darwin formulated his ground-breaking theory of evolution on the remote archipelago, Attenborough explains how life on the islands has continued to evolve in biological isolation, examining how the ever-changing volcanic landscape has given birth to species and sub-species that exist nowhere else in the world. He begins by revealing how Galapagos rose from the ocean four million years ago.(n)</desc>

At the Brennans, Niamh applies the finishing touches to her plan to flee to Spain, but cannot resist a few more opportunities to mess with Paul, whose ever-escalating attempts to hide his infidelity have now become laughably bad. Dermot and Ben share the perfect Christmas morning together, but even without his involvement in Niamh's plot, the ailing dad knows this idyllic moment is a fleeting distraction from his failing condition.

Ciaran bring a captive Katy some presents, and she concedes she has enjoyed her Christmas, and things are awkward at the O'Briens' as Jackie comes to dinner.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Ever since suffering a brain infection four years ago, Sunderland woman June Findlay has been unable to walk or talk and is totally dependent on her devoted husband John. Since then she has been sleeping on a hospital bed in the kitchen, with no washing or toilet facilities. Joan and John do their best, but Nick Knowles believes they deserve better, so he and his small band of builders - bolstered by an army of local tradespeople - set out to extend the Findlays' home, with designer Oliver Heath on hand to protect his vision. Can they give June back her dignity?.(n)</desc>

He begins by revealing how Galapagos rose from the ocean four million years ago.(n)</desc>

More than 150 years after Charles Darwin formulated his ground-breaking theory of evolution on the remote archipelago, Attenborough explains how life on the islands has continued to evolve in biological isolation, examining how the ever-changing volcanic landscape has given birth to species and sub-species that exist nowhere else in the world. He begins by revealing how Galapagos rose from the ocean four million years ago.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">2016 Day Three.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Another chance to see the third and final day at Hazeltine National Golf Club in Minnesota, featuring the singles matches between the USA and Europe. The 12 matchplay contests always produce a wealth of drama and quality golf, although Europe eased to a relatively comfortable victory last time out at Gleneagles, turning a 10-6 overnight advantage into a 16.5-11.5 triumph. This time the Americans started as favourites, with half of the European team never having experienced Ryder Cup golf before, adding extra responsibility to the likes of Rory McIlroy, Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Winter Passing</title>
    <desc lang="en">Money and emotions lead to a difficult reunion between a father and daughter in this drama. Reese Holden (Zooey Deschanel) is a struggling stage actress in New York City whose life has become an uphill struggle -- her career isn't giving her satisfaction, her relationship with would-be rock star Ray (Dallas Roberts) is stuck in neutral, an affair with her friend Rob (Robert Beitzel) brings no excitement, and her colleague Deirdre (Deirdre O'Connell) simply doesn't understand her problems. Reese is also short on money, which is why she's willing to listen to a proposal from a publisher who wants to release a series of love letters that her mother, a well-known author who died years ago, wrote to her father, Don (Ed Harris), another respected novelist who has fallen out of the limelight but is said to be working on a final major work. Having accepted an advance for the collection, Reese pays a visit to Don in Michigan to get his OK for the project and collect the letters, but discovers two strangers have moved in with Don -- Shelly (Amelia Warner), who studied under Don and has installed herself as his business manager, and Corbit (Will Ferrell), a neighborhood sad sack who helps with the housekeeping and runs errands for the reclusive writer. As Reese vies with Shelly for her father's attention, she struggles to come to terms with issues from her childhood and the dissatisfaction with her life. Winter Passing was written and directed by noted playwright Adam Rapp; it was his first feature film(n)</desc>

Caroline Wexler (Kat Dennings) is a clever but cynical 17-year-old whose father is still adjusting to the death of his wife. Caroline's dad takes a new job and they move to a strange community where the sky is always dark thanks to an industrial fire that's been burning for several months and isn't going to be put out anytime soon. Caroline doesn't have much use for her backward drug-addled classmates, and so to relieve her boredom she sets out to seduce Mr. Anderson (Josh Lucas), the best-looking man on the school's faculty. While Mr. Anderson tries to avoid responding to Caroline's blunt sexual overtures, it isn't long before he succumbs to her charms and is sleeping with his new student. But Caroline's new romance turns into a romantic triangle when Thurston (Reece Thompson), one of her stoner classmates, falls head over heels for her and she gives him a chance to impress her. Before long, Thurston is declaring Caroline the love of his life, Mr. Anderson is angry over having a rival for her affections, and the local serial killer begins to make their presence known, picking off the town's teenagers one by one. Also featuring Andie MacDowell and Ted Whittall, Daydream Nation was the first feature film from writer and director Mike Goldbach(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Regarding Henry</title>
    <desc lang="en">Combining elements of A Christmas Carol and Rain Man (1988), this modern-day parable of greed and redemption was crafted with generous helpings of sentimentality by director Mike Nicholas. Harrison Ford stars as Henry Turner, a slick, ruthless corporate attorney willing to spin any falsehood to win a case. A bully to his teenage daughter Rachel (Mikki Allen), Henry also cheats on his wife Sarah (Annette Bening) and treats everyone from the maid to his assistant with cruel selfishness. Stepping out to a local mini-market for a pack of cigarettes late one night, Henry accidentally interrupts a burglary and is shot in the head by a stick-up artist. After a long coma, Henry survives only to find that he has no memory and must re-learn everything from reading to tying his shoes. Reborn as a friendly, childlike innocent, Henry charms his therapist (Bill Nunn) and reconnects with his wife and daughter, only to uncover some secrets about how truly appalling he once was(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Emperor's Club</title>
    <desc lang="en">A dedicated teacher learns some important lessons about himself years after he retired from the classroom in this drama. William Hundert (Kevin Kline) is an instructor at St. Benedict's School for Boys, an exclusive private academy on the East Coast where Hundert drills his charges on the moral lessons to be learned through the study of Greek and Roman philosophers. Hundert is fond of telling his students, "A man's character is his fate," and he strives to impress upon them the importance of the ordered and examined life. In 1976, however, Hundert finds himself with an especially challenging group of students -- party-minded Fred Masoudi (Jesse Eisenberg) , introverted Martin Blythe (Paul Dano), bright but mischievous Deepak Mehta (Rishi Mehta), and most notably, openly rebellious Sedgewick Bell (Emile Hirsch). The son of a powerful politician, Bell pointedly runs against the current of Hundert's example, questioning the importance of the material, flouting the school's rules, talking out of turn in class, and devoting as much time to his interest in girls as in his studies. However, Hundert sees the possibility of great things in Bell, and encourages him to take part in the school's annual academic competition for the title of Mr. Julius Caesar. Hundert even goes so far as to bend the rules in scoring to favor Bell in the early stages of the contest, but his faith is betrayed when Bell is discovered cheating during the contest finals. Years later, Hundert is reunited with his students, where they learn the years have taught them all a great deal about their virtues and weaknesses. The Emperor's Club also features Harris Yulin, Rob Morrow, and Edward Herrmann(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Butterfly</title>
    <desc lang="en">Veteran director Jose Luis Cuerda delivered this sensitive portrait of a child coming of age during a tense political situation just before the Spanish Civil War. On his first day of school, frail eight-year-old Moncho (Manuel Lozano) is so terrified by the imposing figure of his teacher Don Gregorio (Fernando Fernan Gomez) that he flees into the nearby woods. In spite of his authoritarian appearance, the schoolmaster proves to be a kind, free-thinking Republican who teaches Moncho the virtues of being good. The boy is soon spending much of his time with the elderly Gregorio in the Galician countryside, admiring such wonders of nature as the tongue of a butterfly. Other people in young Moncho's world include his down-to-earth mother (Uxia Blanco), his Republican father, and his older brother, who plays the saxophone with a group of local musicians. However, when the Fascists roll into town, the boy's life changes forever. La Lengua de las Mariposas was screened at the 1999 San Sebastian Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">An unruly collection of clever but crass Thatcher-era English high-school students seek to earn the scores needed to enroll in Oxford and Cambridge in director Nicholas Hytner and screenwriter Alan Bennett's screen adaptation of Bennett's Tony-winning play. The History Boys focuses on a group of eight students, all of them deemed by their overeager headmaster (Clive Merrison) to be the best and the brightest. Though they've been coddled by their humanities-loving instructor, Hector (Richard Griffiths), and their acerbic history teacher, Mrs. Lintott (Frances de la Tour), the boys are deemed in need of additional tutoring; thus, the brash, young Irwin (Stephen Campbell Moore) is recruited to challenge them further. The subtle power games the boys used to their advantage with their previous tutors are of no use with Irwin, whose wit borders on the callous. Meanwhile, Irwin's presence -- and a hush-hush scandal -- forces all of the faculty members to reassess their position at the school. Hytner shot The History Boys shortly after the play's Broadway run, to capitalize on the enthusiasm and energy exhibited in the live shows(n)</desc>

Eager to show his father that he can succeed, Seth lands a job with a small stock brokerage firm. He is given a space in the company's "boiler room," where he makes cold calls to prospective clients. As it turns out, Seth has a genuine talent for cold calling, which gains him the approval of his superiors, the admiration of his father, and the attentions of one of his co-workers, Abby Hilliard (Nia Long). However, the higher up the ladder Seth rises, the deeper he sinks into a quagmire of dirty dealings, until he's breaking the law in order to keep his bosses happy and his paychecks coming. The Boiler Room also features Tom Everett Scott, Scott Caan, Jamie Kennedy, Nicky Katt, and Ben Affleck in a cameo as the headhunter who brings Seth into the firm. Ribisi and Scott also appeared together in That Thing You Do; Ribisi was the drummer replaced by Scott, who then led The One-Ders to fictional pop stardom(n)</desc>

Harris's shot her film for $100,000 in seventeen days and won a prize at the Sundance Film Festival for outstanding achievement in a first feature. The film can be sliced into two distinct sections. The first half concerns Brooklyn high-school student Chantel (Ariyan Johnson) as she deals with academic disagreements with her teachers (at one point getting into shouting match about the Holocaust), takes advantage of her boyfriend's wallet to go on a shopping spree, and confronts yuppies in the Upper West Side gourmet shop where she works.

    <title lang="en">Next Avengers: Heroes of Tomorrow</title>
    <desc lang="en">When a nefarious villain named Ultron emerges to threaten mankind, the next generation of superheroes leaps into action and prepares to make their famous parents proud. It's been decades since Ultron defeated the original Avengers, and these days even the few folks that had held out hope for the future are finally ready to admit defeat. But Tony Stark has a surprise up his sleeve in the form of four amazing teenagers who just might have the power to defeat Ultron once and for all. But will James (son of Captain America and Black Widow), Pym (son of Wasp and Giant Man), Torunn (daughter of Thor) and Azari (son of the Black Panther) truly be capable of defeating the villain who brought about the downfall of their powerful parents? As the battle gets underway and Hawkeye's sharp-shooting son leaps into the fray, the team realizes that they might stand a fighting chance if they can only track down the mission Hulk and encourage him to become a member of the team. Should they succeed in defeating Ultron, this group will forever be known as The Next Avengers(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Of Late I Think of Cliffordville. This 60-minute Twilight Zone entry was adapted by Rod Serling from Malcolm Jameson's short story "Blind Alley." Wearing thick "age" makeup, Albert Salmi stars as ruthless millionaire Feathersmith, who would give anything to relive his carefree youth. Enter Miss Devlin (Julie Newmar) -- actually the Devil, but a very shapely Devil -- who offers to strike a deal with the decrepit tycoon. Curiously, Devlin doesn't want Feathersmith's soul (which he had already lost several years earlier), but she will settle for cold, hard cash. Another cautionary "Be Careful What You Wish For" yarn, "Of Late I Think of Cliffordville" originally aired April 11, 1963(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Filmmaker Guillermo del Toro teams up with Legendary Pictures to bring audiences a unique take on the monster film with this sci-fi production. Charlie Hunnam (Sons of Anarchy) stars as a washed-out controller and pilot of a series of robots called Jaegers, which are put into production after Earth is invaded by a species of giant monsters, the Kaijus. The Brothers Bloom's Rinko Kikuchi co-stars as a trainee whom Hunnam is psychically paired with in order to pilot the last beacon of hope -- a decommissioned Jaeger assigned to stop the Kaijus once and for all. Thor's Idris Elba leads the rest of the starring cast, which includes Charlie Day, Rob Kazinsky and Ron Perlman(n)</desc>
