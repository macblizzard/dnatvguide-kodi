Olly and Tamsin from Bolton want to create a fairy-tale wooden hideaway in their garden for just £1,000, while in Kent, landscape gardener Barry and his girlfriend Deleck seek to recreate a classic teardrop trailer with an ocean twist. George's personal project for the series, with the help of master craftsman Will Hardie, involves transforming his own wasted garden space into a family studio, complete with a games room, cinema room, planetarium and butterfly house.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Dennis Rader.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">David Wilson analyses the personality and motivations of American serial killer Dennis Rader, who was convicted in 2005 of murdering 10 people between 1974 and 1991. He became known as the `BTK killer' after he offered it as a suggestion in a series of taunting letters to police and media - the letters standing for `bind, torture, kill'. The criminologist travels to the US to examine how the disturbing behaviour displayed by Rader as a child gave an early indication that he would grow into a psychopath, and also hears from some of the victims' families, an officer who worked on the case, and one of his neighbours.(n)</desc>

Along the rocky road of their coupling, Allen/Alvy weigh in on such topics as endless therapy, movies vs. TV, the absurdity of dating rituals, anti-Semitism, drugs, and, in one of the best set pieces, repressed Midwestern WASP insanity vs. crazy Brooklyn Jewish boisterousness. Annie wants to move to Los Angeles to find that fame that finally does in the relationship -- but not before Alvy gets in a few digs at vacuous, mantra-fixated California. Originally entitled Anhedonia (the inability to enjoy oneself), Annie Hall blended the slapstick and fantasy from such earlier Allen films as Sleeper (1973) and Bananas (1971) with the more autobiographical musings of his stand-up and written comedy, using an array of such movie techniques as talking heads, splitscreens, and subtitles. Within these gleeful formal experiments and sight gags, Allen and co-writer Marshall Brickman skewered 1970s solipsism, reversing the happy marriage of opposites found in classic screwball comedies. Hailed as Allen's most mature and personal film, Annie Hall beat out Star Wars for Best Picture and also won Oscars for Allen as director and writer and for Keaton as Best Actress; audiences enthusiastically responded to Allen's take on contemporary love and turned Keaton's rumpled menswear into a fashion trend(n)</desc>

Crowe believes that actively engaging with the ghostly presences could help both Sear and the spirits to find peace. Overcoming his terror, the lad finds that communicating with the deceased does, at first, seem to be beneficial. But then matters take on their own momentum, leading to one of the director's trademark plot twists... Also starring Toni Collette. M,W,S,(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Who Wants to Be a Millionaire</title>
    <desc lang="en">Although the once-hot game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? had lost its luster as a prime-time ABC offering, the producers felt that there was enough life left in the property to warrant a Monday-through-Friday syndicated version. Taking over from the earlier series' host Regis Philbin was Meredith Vieira of The View. To make certain that the series would not be bankrupted after its first week on the air, the questions posed to contestants were considerably harder than those on the prime-time incarnation. Also, the famous "fastest finger" round was eliminated, taking some of the pressure off the contestants when they struggled to come up with answers. The most noteworthy change from the original version was the absence of Regis Philbin's familiar catchphrases: One would never hear Meredith Vieira chime in with the legendary "Is that your final answer?" The syndicated Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? was launched on September 16, 2002(n)</desc>

They must manoeuvre themselves past Granny's House, watching out for the angry dog nipping at their ankles and a front door guaranteed to smack them in the face. They then cling onto the ski lift to avoid plunging into the icy waters, before riding the conveyor belt that throws them onto those old Wipeout favourites, the big red balls. Amanda Byram laughs it up at the side of the course.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">27 Dresses</title>
    <desc lang="en">A single woman who has served as a bridesmaid a shocking 27 times wrestles with the prospect of supporting her sister at the altar on number 28, despite having fallen helplessly in love with her smitten sibling's handsome husband-to-be. Jane (Katherine Heigl) has the kind of altruistic traits that everyone looks for in a friend, yet lately the perennial bridesmaid has begun to feel as if something is missing in her life. One night, local newspaper reporter Kevin (James Marsden) spots the devoted bridal attendant racing between receptions in Manhattan and Brooklyn, and quickly surmises that her quirky tale may be just the story to get him off the bridal beat and into the big time. Immediately suspicious of the cynical reporter's motivations, Jane butts heads with Kevin just as her younger sister Tess (Malin Akerman) shows up in town. While Jane has always put the needs of friends and family before her own wants and desires, she's suddenly prompted to reevaluate her priorities when her boss -- with whom she is secretly in love -- falls for her younger sister Tess. When Tess and Jane's boss George (Edward Burns) make plans to marry, the smitten younger sibling mistakenly assumes that her lovelorn older sibling will be happy to take part in the wedding. For as far back as Jane can remember, she has sacrificed her own happiness for the sake of those she holds dearest, but now that her heart has been broken, she's finally found the courage to be honest with herself. Now, as Jane finally comes to terms with her true feelings, her life begins to change in ways she never expected. Judy Greer and Melora Hardin co-star in a romantic comedy scripted by The Devil Wears Prada screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna and directed by Anne Fletcher (Step Up)(n)</desc>

More often than not, it's because a group of organised metal thieves has struck. Jamie Theakston narrates.(n)</desc>

The trio believe they can do a better job than explorers who claim to have discovered the waterway's starting point by travelling further and faster than previous efforts - but the only tools at their disposal are determination, ingenuity and three ageing estate cars.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The team joins diggers in Sheffield as they near the end of their six-year excavation to uncover the Industrial Revolution's forgotten city. Once the world's biggest producer of steel and renowned for its exquisite cutlery even 200 years ago, the city was prosperous, but the spectre of death, dangerous machinery and the worst man-made disaster in British history still remain. Tony Robinson helps the archaeologists at the final stage of their task, while Phil Harding attempts to make a steel knife.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Tony Robinson and the team embark on a dig at Loch Tay in Scotland. Beneath the surface lie the remains of an Iron Age crannog or wooden house on stilts. Unusual structures such as this were built on lakes all over Scotland, but this is the first to be explored fully, over the course of an eight-week dive. The clean, peaty quality of the water means the artefacts uncovered are perfectly preserved, providing a remarkable insight into how these buildings were constructed and how the residents lived 2,600 years ago.(n)</desc>

An exploration of the class and power dynamics in college sports through the interconnected journeys of one-time dynamic running back Maurice Clarett and former elite head coach Jim Tressel.

Shortly after, Clarett was suspended from college football and began a downward spiral that ended with a prison term. Tressel continued at Ohio State for another eight years before his career there also ended in scandal. Also available in HD(n)</desc>

While Bart Simpson (voice of Nancy Cartwright) and his sister Lisa (voice of Yeardley Smith) are loyal fans of The Itchy and Scratchy Show , even they are forced to admit that the show's writing has gone to the dogs, and one day they decide they could come up with better stories than the show's current production staff. Bart and Lisa team up and write a script for Itchy and Scratchy , but Roger Meyers Jr. (voice of Alex Rocco), the show's producer, rejects it because the Simpson siblings are too young. Undaunted, Bart and Lisa resubmit the script, with Grampa Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) credited as the author; it's accepted, and soon "Grampa" is getting more work from Itchy and Scratchy . But things become a bit complicated when a script by "Grampa" is nominated for an Emmy, and Bart and Lisa have to persuade him to attend the ceremony. Meanwhile, after attending their high school reunion, Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) is forced to admit to Marge (voice of Julie Kaver) that he failed Remedial Science 1A, and therefore never officially graduated. Homer decides to go back to school and finally get his diploma, but it soon becomes obvious that he hasn't improved much as a student over the years. "The Front" was first aired on April 15, 1993; Brooke Shields makes a cameo appearance as a presenter at the Emmy Awards(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Homer Goes to College. A team of inspectors from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission make an unannounced visit at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, and several employees are tested to see how they would deal with an emergency. Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) proves to astoundingly inept, bringing the test's phony plant to the point of a meltdown, and Homer is ordered to return to school and pass a course in Nuclear Physics before he can return to his job. Homer enrolls in Springfield University after Mr. Burns (voice of Harry Shearer) intercedes on his behalf, but true to form, Homer's notion of academia seem to be informed more clearly by bad 1980s college comedies rather than the pursuit of higher learning. With his grades going steadily downhill, Homer is introduced to three science students who will be his tutors, Doug (voice of Hank Azaria), Gary (voice of Dan Castellaneta), and Ben (voice of Harry Shearer). Homer is more interested in teaching his nerdy new friends the fine art of partying rather than doing schoolwork, and after Homer talks them into stealing the mascot of crosstown rivals Springfield A&amp;M, Doug, Gary, and Ben are kicked out of school. "Homer Goes to College" was first aired on October 14, 1993(n)</desc>

Homer immediately buys the meat and wolfs it down, only to discover Apu (voice of Hank Azaria) was selling the meat cheaply because it was spoiled and out of date. Homer gets terribly sick, and at the urging of his daughter Lisa (voice of Yeardley Smith), he takes part in a TV news program's undercover investigation. Apu's underhanded back-dating practices are revealed, and he loses his longtime job at the Kwik-E-Mart. After actor James Woods takes over Apu's job as he researches a film role, Apu moves into the Simpson home to make amends for poisoning Homer. While Apu becomes a part of the family, the Kwik-E-Mart is in his blood, and so he journeys to India (with Homer in tow) to appeal his case with the spiritually enlightened president of the Kwik-E-Mart corporation.

The game turns out to be a near-perfect day for Homer: the seats for the game are great, Flanders springs for drinks and snacks, Springfield wins the game, and after being presented with the game ball, Ned gives it to Homer. Suddenly, Homer has decided that Ned is his new best friend, and begins spending even less time with his family to hang out with Flanders. Ned, however, soon discovers a little time with Homer goes a long way, and suddenly their attitudes have been reversed -- Homer is the well-meaning friendly one, while Flanders is the cranky guy who keeps wishing his neighbor would go away.

Bill and Marty (voices of Dan Castellaneta and Harry Shearer), wacky morning drive-time DJ's on Springfield's radio station KBBL, are staging a new contest in which the winner gets to choose between two prizes -- a full grown African elephant or 10,000 dollars. Bart Simpson (voice of Nancy Cartwright) ends up winning the contest, and decides he wants the elephant. Bill and Marty were never expecting anyone to actually choose the elephant, and tell Bart they don't have one to give him. Bart refuses to change his mind, and after the local media picks up on the story, KBBL relents and gives Bart an elephant, which he calls Stampy. Bart loves his new pet, but Stampy is less than excited about his new environment, while Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) and Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) aren't sure how they'll pay for the elephant's feeding and upkeep, and Lisa (voice of Yeardley Smith) believes Stampy should be in a jungle, where he belongs. Eventually, Homer and Marge put their feet down and tell Bart that Stampy can't stay with them; an animal sanctuary is willing to take Stampy, but they can't pay anything for him, while a less than scrupulous ivory dealer is willing to give the Simpsons a big check for the elephant, but he would almost certainly kill the animal.

Montgomery Burns (voice of Harry Shearer) has a near-death experience after almost drowning in a bathtub, and he decides since he has no children, he should choose a young boy to become his ward and take over his empire (and his fortune) after he passes on. Burns stages open auditions for the position, and Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) prods his son, Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright), into asking for the honors. Burns, as is his custom, is appallingly rude to Bart, and the boy gets revenge by damaging Burns' property. Appreciating Bart's defiant nature, Burns makes him his ward, and Bart begins spending much of his free time at the lavish Burns estate. Homer and Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) discover that this is doing nothing to improve the behavior of their already troublesome son, and after an attempt to discipline the boy, Bart simply moves out to take up permanent residence with Burns. Eventually, even Burns sees that Bart should be with his family, but it takes some doing to convince him to go home. "Burns' Heir" was first aired on April 14, 1994(n)</desc>

Marge thinks both Grampa and Jacqueline seem a bit lonely, and she encourages the two to spend time together. They do, and before long Grampa has fallen in love with Jacqueline. Grampa is considering popping the big question to Jacqueline during a dance at the Senior Citizen's Center when he discovers that he has a rival for her affections -- aging multi-millionaire C. Montgomery Burns (voice of Harry Shearer). Grampa can't match Burns' bankroll (or his dancing ability), but when he learns that Burns has planned to wed Jacqueline, he's determined to stop the ceremony however he can. Meanwhile, rabid Itchy and Scratchy fan Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright) can't resist temptation when rare animation cells from the show are offered for sale on television.

    <desc lang="en">Secrets of a Successful Marriage. While no one has ever accused Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) of being an intellectual heavyweight, one day he finally tires of people suggesting he's stupid and decides to enroll in an adult education course. He soon discovers, though, that most of the classes he's interested in are being taught by family and friends, and he's too intimidated to attend. Instead, Homer signs up to teach a class of his own on how to have a successful marriage; however, since he doesn't have much to say, most of his students look bored to tears until he starts telling secrets about his wife, Marge (voice of Julie Kavner), including the fact that she dyes her hair and gets turned on when Homer nibbles her elbow. When word of this gets back to Marge, she's understandably furious, and orders Homer not to talk about her in class. But the next time Homer runs out of material in class, he relapses into stories about Marge, and she kicks him out of the house. Marge begins to seriously consider following the advice of Reverend Lovejoy (voice of Harry Shearer) and divorce Homer, while Homer moves into Bart's tree house, desperate to win his wife back.

In The Shinning, Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) gets a job as winter caretaker at a resort hotel high in the mountains owned by Mr. Burns (voice of Harry Shearer). The maintenance man, Groundskeeper Willie (voice of Castellaneta), discovers Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright) shares his psychic gift of "shinning" ("You mean 'shining'?" "Shh! You wanna get sued?!?"), which comes in handy when Homer snaps under the pressure after finding the hotel has no beer or television. Time and Punishment finds Homer trying to fix a toaster and somehow becoming unstuck in time, encountering any number of alternate histories as he zooms back and forth from the prehistoric age to the "present." And in Nightmare Cafeteria, Bart and Lisa (voice of Yeardley Smith) notice that students kept after school for detention are disappearing, as the cafeteria is suddenly serving an abundance of rich, meaty dishes, leading the quickly shrinking number of students to wonder if Principal Skinner (voice of Shearer) and Lunchlady Doris (voice of Doris Grau) are resorting to cannibalism.

    <desc lang="en">Homie the Clown. While Krusty the Clown (voice of Dan Castellaneta) may be a beloved television personality and the biggest star in Springfield, he's still having trouble living the lifestyle to which he's become accustomed, thanks in part to his voracious appetite for pornography and habit of betting against the Harlem Globetrotters. Hoping to boost his profits, Krusty opens a clown college, where he can train others to impersonate him at personal appearances in exchange for a percentage of their fees. Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) decides being a clown is his true calling, and becomes one of Krusty's first enrollees. After learning the ropes of clowning, Homer is imitating Krusty at birthday parties, openings of businesses, and local Cable Ace award ceremonies; he finds the work is a lot more about hard work than glamour, and he's about to call it quits when Chief Wiggum (voice of Hank Azaria) pulls him over one night -- and is convinced Homer really is Krusty. Homer finds it's easy to convince people he's the real clown, and he decides to enjoy some of the advantages of life in the fast lane, until he discovers that Krusty owes a lot of money to gangster Fat Tony (voice of Joe Mantegna), and Fat Joe doesn't believe him when he says he's really Homer Simpson. Dick Cavett and Johnny Unitas also make voice cameos as themselves. "Homie the Clown" first aired on February 12, 1995(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A Star Is Burns. The citizens of Springfield decide they need to spruce up the town's image, and Marge Simpson (voice of Julie Kavner) suggests that sponsoring a Springfield Film Festival might be a good way to do it. The idea is enthusiastically received, and Marge is able to persuade well-known film critic Jay Sherman (voice of Jon Lovitz) to lead the jury. Though overweight and balding, Jay has charm and wit where Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) does not, and after Jay wins over Marge and her sisters, Patty and Selma (both voiced by Julie Kavner), Homer insists on being made a judge for the festival in order to prove his intelligence and sophistication. However, while most of the jury is moved to tears by a film about the tragedy of alcoholism by Barney Gumble (voice of Dan Castellaneta), which bears the unfortunate title "Puke-ahontas," Homer is insistent upon handing the grand prize to a minute-long short in which Hans Moleman (voice of Dan Castellaneta) is hit in the crotch with a football. Meanwhile, C. Montgomery Burns (voice of Harry Shearer) wants to refurbish his image as an aging, cold-hearted energy czar, and decides to make a film about himself, "A Burns for All Seasons," which is to be directed either by Steven Spielberg, or his nonunion Mexican equivalent. "A Star Is Burns" introduced the character of Jay Sherman, who a few weeks later debuted in his own animated series, The Critic, which was produced by several members of the creative team behind The Simpsons. "A Star Is Burns" first aired on March 5, 1995(n)</desc>

During a visit to a petting zoo, Lisa Simpson (voice of Yeardley Smith) makes friends with a baby lamb, and suffers a crisis of conscience that evening when her mother, Marge (voice of Julie Kavner), serves lamb chops for dinner. Lisa decides she can no longer morally accept eating animals, and becomes a vegetarian, which doesn't go over especially well with her father, noted pork enthusiast Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta). When Homer decides to throw a big barbecue to spite his neighbor Ned Flanders (voice of Harry Shearer), Lisa tries to convince him to make it a vegetarian cookout, but Homer isn't about to give up meat for his shindig. When Lisa liberates the roast pig that was to be the main course at the barbecue, Lisa and Homer have a major falling out, but she soon discovers another passionate vegetarian in Springfield -- convenience store magnate Apu (voice of Hank Azaria) -- who introduces Lisa to his longtime friends Paul and Linda McCartney (who provide their own voices) while passing along a lesson about tolerance. "Lisa the Vegetarian" also featured a guest appearance by Phil Hartman as Troy McClure, who narrates the educational film ''Meat and You: Partners in Freedom." Paul McCartney's appearance made him the last of the surviving Beatles to pop up on the show, appropriately in an episode which championed one of his favorite causes, vegetarianism.

Former second-string movie star and current demi-celebrity for hire Troy McClure (voice of Phil Hartman) is making his way home one night when he's pulled over for driving without his glasses. McClure needs to retake his vision test before his license will be restored, but since he's too vain to wear his specs in public, the results are not especially good. However, Selma Bouvier (voice of Julie Kavner) is charmed by McClure and agrees to give him a passing grade in exchange for a date. After dinner, a photographer spots McClure and snaps his picture with Selma; the picture is published in the "Springfield Shopper," and turns out to be one of the first bits of positive publicity Troy has received since widespread allegation of his bizarre sexual attraction to fish tarnished his career years before. McClure's agent, MacArthur Parker (voice of Jeff Goldblum), informs his client that he might be able to get him work again if he's seen with human females on a regular basis, and Troy soon asks for Selma's hand in marriage. However, the night before the wedding, Troy confesses to his soon-to-be brother-in-law, Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta), that he's only marrying Selma to kick start his career. When word of this gets back to Selma's sisters, Marge and Patty (both voiced by Julie Kavner), they both urge her to get out of her sham marriage before it's too late. However, Selma has come to enjoy the life of semi-fame, and is willing to go along with the charade until Troy mentions his agent's latest advice for putting his career back on the fast track -- having a baby. "A Fish Called Selma" was first aired on March 24, 1996(n)</desc>

Agent 47 is an elite, genetically engineered assassin who takes great pride in his work. His lethal grace, steady shot, and unparalleled precision have all served to make him one of the most sought-after assassins in the world. But when the killer without a conscience is faced with an unanticipated series of developments, his entire perception of reality begins to shift. On assignment to take out Russian head of state Belicoff (Ulrich Thomsen), Agent 47 is caught off guard by the appearance of presidential look-alikes. When the high-profile hit captures the attention of such powerful intelligence organizations as the CIA and Interpol, agent Mike Whittier (Dougray Scott) is dispatched to rein Agent 47 in. Meanwhile, a mysterious Russian prostitute named Nika (Olga Kurylenko) has walked into Agent 47's life, causing the methodical killer to become overwhelmed by emotions that were previously foreign to him(n)</desc>

Agent 47 is an elite, genetically engineered assassin who takes great pride in his work. His lethal grace, steady shot, and unparalleled precision have all served to make him one of the most sought-after assassins in the world. But when the killer without a conscience is faced with an unanticipated series of developments, his entire perception of reality begins to shift. On assignment to take out Russian head of state Belicoff (Ulrich Thomsen), Agent 47 is caught off guard by the appearance of presidential look-alikes. When the high-profile hit captures the attention of such powerful intelligence organizations as the CIA and Interpol, agent Mike Whittier (Dougray Scott) is dispatched to rein Agent 47 in. Meanwhile, a mysterious Russian prostitute named Nika (Olga Kurylenko) has walked into Agent 47's life, causing the methodical killer to become overwhelmed by emotions that were previously foreign to him(n)</desc>

Though initially the pair seems to have nothing in common, conversation gradually reveals that both men have a long list of goals they wish to accomplish before they kick the bucket, and an unrealized desire to discover what kind of men they really are. But one can't accomplish such lofty objectives from the confines of a hospital bed, so now, in order to live their lives to the absolute fullest, Edward and Carter will have to make a break for it. With a checklist that includes playing the poker tables in Monte Carlo, consuming copious amounts of caviar, racing the fastest machines on four wheels, and much more, these two terminally ill men will do their best to fit a lifetime of experience into their last remaining days while forging an unlikely, but truly remarkable, friendship(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">He's mean, he's green, and he's doesn't like the Yuletide season one bit -- Jim Carrey stars in this live-action adaptation of the classic children's story by Dr. Seuss (aka Theodore Geisel). High atop Mt. Crumpet, the Grinch (Carrey) observes the residents of Whoville joyously preparing to celebrate Christmas. The Grinch was born in Whoville years ago, but was shunned due to his scary appearance, and his unrequited love for Martha May Whovier has turned him bitter; the good cheer of the Whos has been a thorn in his side ever since. Finally the Grinch decides he's had enough of all this happiness, and with the wary aid of his dog Max, the Grinch conspires to steal Christmas from Whoville, making off with their presents, holiday decorations, Christmas trees, and everything else used to enjoy the holiday. Molly Shannon, Christine Baranski, Jeffrey Tambor, and Clint Howard play several of the citizens of Whoville, while Anthony Hopkins narrates (taking over from the late Boris Karloff, who memorably read Dr. Seuss' story in Chuck Jones' 1966 animated adaptation of the story).

Agent 47 is an elite, genetically engineered assassin who takes great pride in his work. His lethal grace, steady shot, and unparalleled precision have all served to make him one of the most sought-after assassins in the world.

On assignment to take out Russian head of state Belicoff (Ulrich Thomsen), Agent 47 is caught off guard by the appearance of presidential look-alikes. When the high-profile hit captures the attention of such powerful intelligence organizations as the CIA and Interpol, agent Mike Whittier (Dougray Scott) is dispatched to rein Agent 47 in. Meanwhile, a mysterious Russian prostitute named Nika (Olga Kurylenko) has walked into Agent 47's life, causing the methodical killer to become overwhelmed by emotions that were previously foreign to him(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Following their television series Home Improvement and the features The Santa Clause (1994) and Jungle 2 Jungle (1997), the actor/director team of Tim Allen and John Pasquin collaborate once again on this high-concept comedy. Allen stars as Joe Scheffer, a nice guy video specialist for a Minneapolis pharmaceutical company who's plodding through both his thankless job and an unhappy divorce from his ex-wife Callie (Kelly Lynch). When Joe brings his daughter Natalie (Hayden Panettiere) to the office with him on Take Our Kids to Work Day, he's humiliated in a spat with company bully Mark McKinney (Patrick Warburton) over a parking space. It's the last straw for the mild-mannered Joe, who challenges McKinney to a rematch, hires a has-been action movie star (Jim Belushi) to instruct him in martial arts, and pays a stylist to make over his wardrobe and hair. As Joe's image improves and the big day approaches, he finds his new self-respecting stance has positive effects in both the workplace, as he lands a long-overdue promotion, and in his romantic life, as both Callie and a cute "wellness coordinator" (Julie Bowen) start warming up to him. The levelheaded Natalie, however, seems to prefer the previously non-confrontational dad she already loved. Joe Somebody (2001) is the feature debut of screenwriter John Scott Shepherd, who actually worked as a corporate filmmaker in Minneapolis(n)</desc>

But when a fellow "fixer" decides to turn on the very firm they were hired to clean up for, Clayton finds himself at the center of a conspiratorial maelstrom. Once an ambitious D.A., Clayton is now a shell of his former dynamic self, thanks to a divorce, an unfortunate business venture, and astronomical debt. Though he longs to leave the cutthroat, ethically dubious world of corporate law behind, Clayton's poor financial situation and devotion to firm head Marty Bach (Sydney Pollack) leave him little choice but to remain on the job and tough it out. Meanwhile, litigator Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton) finds her entire company's future hinging on the outcome of a multi-billion-dollar settlement overseen by Clayton's friend, star lawyer Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson). When Edens snaps and decides to blow the whistle on the questionable case, sabotaging the defense, Clayton must decide between his loyalty and his conscience(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Made for television, The Christmas Blessing is a sequel to the earlier CBS holiday offering The Christmas Shoes, with Rob Lowe briefly reprising his portrayal of Robert Layton, a lawyer whose life was forever changed by a pair of "enchanted" shoes. This time around, the shoes have passed into the hands of Tucker Bennett (Shaun Johnston), the son of a seriously ill youngster named Charlie (Angus T. Jones. As fate would have it, Charlie is a student of schoolteacher Meghan (Rebecca Gayheart), who is endeavoring to set up a day-care center for single moms in the small town where she lives. At the same time in the same town, young medical resident Nathan Andrews (Neil Patrick Harris), his self-confidence shattered by the death of a teenage patient on the operating table, has returned home to work in the garage owned by his dad Jack (Shaun Johnston). In due course, Nathan meets Meghan and Charlie, and becomes intimately involved in the trials and tribulations of both, leading to an emotional climax in which Nathan must decide whether or not to summon his dormant medical skills to save Charlie's life. Singers NewSong and Blake Shelton appear as themselves, respectively performing the title song and the new composition "Nobody But Me". The Christmas Blessing originally aired on December 18, 2005(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Die Hard 2</title>
    <desc lang="en">"Another basement, another elevator...how can the same thing happen to the same guy twice?" asks John McClane (Bruce Willis), in what is doubtless the key question of this film. A year after foiling the terrorist takeover of a high-rise office building in the first movie, McClane is waiting to pick up his wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), at Dulles International Airport just outside Washington, D.C., on Christmas Eve. Scheduled to arrive the same evening is Ramon Esperanza (Franco Nero), a South American political figure who is being brought to the United States to stand trial for his role in a drug-smuggling ring. However, a group of terrorists, led by renegade American military officer Col. Stuart (William Sadler), take control of the airport, scuttling radio transmissions and placing their own men in the control tower. Stuart and his men ensure that Esperanza's plane lands safely, and then demand that Stuart and his men be given a fully-fueled 747 and free passage wherever they choose to go. Otherwise, they will guide the many circling jets waiting for landing instructions into definite crash landings, killing the many passengers on board. Not willing to stand aside as terrorists once again threaten his wife's life, the wise-cracking McClane once again leaps into action to foil Stuart's plans and bring the passenger jets safely to the ground. William Atherton, John Amos, Dennis Franz, and John Leguizamo highlight the supporting cast(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">When the demands of Christmas become too much to handle, one suburban mother responds by going on strike, and inspires the other overburdened mothers in her small community to follow suit. Joy Robertson (Daphne Zuniga) is the kind of mom who likes to make the Christmas season special. But this year, something is different.

When Joy responds by calling a halt to the familiar Christmas traditions, she is quickly joined by the rest of the mothers in her neighborhood. Now the more steam Joy's movement gains, the faster her once quiet town spirals into complete chaos(n)</desc>

Baxter (Kristin Chenoweth) loses her both her fiancé and her job on the night of her holiday work party, she retreats to Kalispell, Montana, to get her life back on track, and hatches an ingenious plan to put the small town on the map.

Unfortunately for E.J., the men in Kalispell aren't too enthusiastic about the idea. If she can just convince them that it's all in good fun and land the perfect Mr. December, however, E.J.'s sexy calendar is sure to sell like hotcakes(n)</desc>

We follow the destinies of a young cheetah mother and her first cubs. With determination she has to transform them from adorable kittens into bold, powerful hunters. Learning to hunt is key to the cubs' chances of surviving in the wild. But this task is a daunting one. The East African plains are full of enemies. The cheetah mother is the weakest link in the chain of predators: lions, leopards and hyenas are a constant and deadly threat to their offspring. And if this were not enough, a gang of three cheetah brothers causes even more trouble. An epic true story set against the backdrop of one of the wildest places of our planet, Cheetah: Fatal Instinct captures the real-life of the sprinters of the African savannah(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Something nefarious is afloat in the depths of Bikini Bottom: King Neptune's crown has been stolen, and the prime suspect is Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob's boss at Mr. Krabs' Krabby Patties. Despite the overwhelming evidence against Mr. Krabs -- not to mention having been turned down for a long-awaited promotion at the restaurant -- SpongeBob (voice of Tom Kenny) refuses to believe that his boss is responsible and teams up with his best friend, Patrick (voice of Bill Fagerbakke), on a mission to Shell City, where he hopes he can exonerate Mr. Krabs and return the crown to its rightful owner. Of course, this is no easy task; once outside the safety of Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob is faced with the overwhelming dangers of the sea, not the least of which being a cyclops that many believe to be responsible for the deaths of countless other unfortunate sea-creatures who ventured outside county lines. Among those who lent their vocal chords to the film include Scarlett Johansson, Jeffrey Tambor, and Alec Baldwin(n)</desc>

The stories of legend are true, and the magical relics owned by such celebrated figures as Cinderella really exist. The malevolent force known as The Krugen knows well that the owner of these objects will reap ultimate power, because by obtaining the magical mirror once owned by the Evil Queen who tormented Snow White, they were able to herald the arrival of the Dark Ages. Centuries later, former Hunter Mason has become a loyal servant of The Krugen. He knows that once he locates all of the pieces of the mirror no one will be able to challenge his evil reign. But Jordyn and Carter Flynn hail from a long line of Hunters, and they've got just the skills to prevent Mason from achieving his diabolical plan. When Jordyn and Carter learn that their parents have gone missing during an important mission, they vow to track them down, and head off a disaster that could alter the entire course of history(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Shadow Zone: The Undead Express</title>
    <desc lang="en">A horror semi-parody targeted at the young adult market that ravenously gobbles up horror books like R.L. Stine's Goosebumps series, this made-for-TV vampire tale stars Chauncey Leopardi as Zach, a teenage rebel with a flair for telling ghost stories, who stumbles on an underground cabal of vampires when he takes a fateful ride on a New York subway. The vampire's leader, Valentine (Ron Silver), proposes a deal to young Zach, offering him safe passage to the world above, thus enabling the trapped vampire -- who can only mingle with humanity through the willing assistance of an innocent youth -- to reach the surface as well. Our young hero balks at this idea and escapes to the surface with a wild story for his skeptical pals, who shun him until one of their number is kidnapped by the undead subway dwellers in exchange for Zach's cooperation. Though atmospherically photographed, this low-budget production is a bit too corny to provide either laughs or chills, and it suffers further from lethargic pacing(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Lost in Translation</title>
    <desc lang="en">After making a striking directorial debut with her screen adaptation of The Virgin Suicides, Sofia Coppola offers a story of love and friendship blooming under unlikely circumstances in this comedy drama. Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is a well-known American actor whose career has gone into a tailspin; needing work, he takes a very large fee to appear in a commercial for Japanese whiskey to be shot in Tokyo. Feeling no small degree of culture shock in Japan, Bob spends most of his non-working hours at his hotel, where he meets Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) at the bar. Twentysomething Charlotte is married to John (Giovanni Ribisi), a successful photographer who is in Tokyo on an assignment, leaving her to while away her time while he works. Beyond their shared bemusement and confusion with the sights and sounds of contemporary Tokyo, Bob and Charlotte share a similar dissatisfaction with their lives; the spark has gone out of Bob's marriage, and he's become disillusioned with his career. Meanwhile, Charlotte is puzzled with how much John has changed in their two years of marriage, while she's been unable to launch a creative career of her own. Bob and Charlotte become fast friends, and as they explore Tokyo, they begin to wonder if their sudden friendship might be growing into something more(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Shawshank Redemption</title>
    <desc lang="en">Based on a story by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption is the directorial debut of screenwriter Frank Darabont. In 1946, a banker named Andy Dufresne is convicted of a double murder, even though he stubbornly proclaims his innocence. He's sentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine, where another lifer, Ellis "Red" Redding, picks him as the new recruit most likely to crack under the pressure. The ugly realities of prison life are quickly introduced to Andy: a corrupt warden,sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley, and inmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or beatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the hope of the truly innocent, which allow him to prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with the warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal business schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the prison staff. In exchange, he is able to improve the prison library and bring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates, including Red. Starring Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins, Bob Gunton(n)</desc>

Through all the hard times, Hannah has been the one constant in Tom's life, and the one person he knows he can always rely on. When Hannah leaves on a business trip to Scotland, Tom is surprised to realise how truly lonely he is without her, so the moment she returns, Tom resolves to ask for her hand in marriage.

Steve's uncle Gary, who is in debt to the mob, has an idea that will solve both their problems: Steve will enter and win at the Special Olympics and Gary will make a fortune betting on him. Feigning learning difficulties, Steve, now calling himself Jeffy Dahmer, joins the team, but his fellow competitors aren't fooled for a moment. Admiring his chutzpah, they keep quiet, and Jeffy also embarks on a romance with volunteer Lynn Sheridan. What could have been an exercise in poor taste rises above it because it treats the characters with both affection and respect, showing the Special Olympians as engaging and humorous individuals and largely poking fun at Gary and Steve(n)</desc>

Helen then discovers that Harry is a secret agent by night, working for a shadowy group called the Omega Sector.

Admiring his chutzpah, they keep quiet, and Jeffy also embarks on a romance with volunteer Lynn Sheridan.

    <desc lang="en">A handsome and successful bachelor is taken aback when his dream girl asks him to be the "maid" of honour in her upcoming wedding. Tom and Hannah have been best friends for years. Through all the hard times, Hannah has been the one constant in Tom's life, and the one person he knows he can always rely on. When Hannah leaves on a business trip to Scotland, Tom is surprised to realise how truly lonely he is without her, so the moment she returns, Tom resolves to ask for her hand in marriage. But apparently Hannah's trip wasn't all business, because upon returning home Hannah announces that she has gotten engaged to a dashing Scotsman and will soon be starting a new life overseas. With his spirits crushed but his love for Hannah stronger than ever before, Tom reluctantly agrees to be the "maid" of honour so that he can prove his love in no uncertain terms and convince her to call off the wedding before true happiness slips through his fingers(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Ringer</title>
    <desc lang="en">Barry W Blaustein's comedy, produced by the Farrelly Brothers, stars Johnny Knoxville as Steve Barker, a low level executive who needs to raise money for his uninsured gardener, who was crippled in an accident. Steve's uncle Gary, who is in debt to the mob, has an idea that will solve both their problems: Steve will enter and win at the Special Olympics and Gary will make a fortune betting on him. Feigning learning difficulties, Steve, now calling himself Jeffy Dahmer, joins the team, but his fellow competitors aren't fooled for a moment. Admiring his chutzpah, they keep quiet, and Jeffy also embarks on a romance with volunteer Lynn Sheridan. What could have been an exercise in poor taste rises above it because it treats the characters with both affection and respect, showing the Special Olympians as engaging and humorous individuals and largely poking fun at Gary and Steve(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">And Soon the Darkness</title>
    <desc lang="en">A carefree vacation to exotic Argentina turns into a sun-soaked nightmare for two young women who find themselves at the mercy of a cunning psychopath in this remake of director Robert Fuest's 1970 thriller. Stephanie (Amber Heard) and Ellie (Odette Yustman) are biking through the Argentinean countryside when they stop to spend the last night of their vacation in a secluded village. When darkness falls, the girls wander over to the nearest bar, where a handsome local charms Ellie while Stephanie heads back to the hotel to good night's sleep. But her rest is interrupted when Stephanie returns to the hotel with her new friend in tow, and a booze-fueled altercation ultimately leads the girls to miss their bus. The following day, Ellie leaves Stephanie alone in the countryside following a heated argument, and grows concerned when her traveling companion fails to meet her at a nearby restaurant shortly thereafter. In the wake of a chance meeting with American expatriate Michael (Karl Urban), whom she had previously seen getting into a minor altercation at the bar, Stephanie reports Ellie's disappearance to local policeman Calvo (César Vianco), who immediately dismisses her suspicions of foul play. Thankfully Michael displays a bit more concern than the local sheriff, and agrees to assist Stephanie in searching for Ellie. But now the more Stephanie confides in Michael, the more she begins to fear that he may have had something to do with Ellie's disappearance, and that by sticking with him she may be walking straight into his trap(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Where Do We Go Now?</title>
    <desc lang="en">Women try to persuade their men to put a stop to war in this fusion of comedy and drama from director, screenwriter, and actress Nadine Labaki. Amale (Labaki) runs a café in a small Lebanese village where the local women, both Christian and Muslim, get together to talk, swap ideas, and share grief as the number who've lost sons or husbands in frequent skirmishes continues to grow. The fighting between religious and political factions has been going on for years, and one day Amale and her friends Afaf (Layla Hakim), Saydeh (Antoinette Noufaily), Takla (Claude Baz Moussawbaa), and Yvonne (Yvonne Maalouf) decide it's time to stop talking about the fighting and do something to bring it to a halt. The local women join forces to distract their men, convinced if they put their minds on other things they won't worry so much about killing. Their efforts range from serving hashish-laced baked goods at a community get-together to hiring Ukrainian dancers to show off their charms to the menfolk. After a young man is killed in a gun battle, the women realize they need to take a stronger stand if they intend to make their home safe again; meanwhile, Christian Amale unwittingly strikes a blow for religious unity when she falls for handsome Muslim Rabih (Julien Farhat). Et Maintenant On Va Ou? (aka Where Do We Go Now?) won the People's Choice Award at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Perfect Holiday</title>
    <desc lang="en">Gabrielle Union, Morris Chestnut, Queen Latifah, and Terrence Howard star in a film concerning a young girl who implores a department-store Santa to find a new husband for her divorced mother for Christmas. Single mother of three Nancy (Union) has been putting the needs of her three children ahead of her own for as far back as she can remember, and lately her youngest daughter, Emily (Khail Bryant), has become acutely aware of her mother's palpable sadness. As Christmas draws near, Nancy takes her kids to the mall for a cheerful visit with jolly old Saint Nick. When it comes time for Emily's turn to sit on Santa's lap and make her Christmas wish, she selflessly remembers her mother's recent comment that a compliment from a man would be the best gift of all. Determined to make her mother happy again even if it means sacrificing her own wish, Emily relays the message to Santa (Chestnut), not realizing that the man beneath the beard is actually an office-supply salesman and ambitious singer/songwriter named Benjamin. Recognizing the daughter's love for her mother and sensing something truly special in Nancy, Benjamin cheerfully obliges the young girl, setting into motion a series of events that promise to make this the most memorable holiday in quite some time. Lance Rivera directs a film produced by Shakim Compere and Latifah through Flavor Unit Entertainment(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Helen's attitude towards local myths and urban legends is cool to say the least, so when she hears about a hook-handed killer who supposedly stalks the streets at night and can be summoned by five chants of 'Candyman' into a mirror, she is naturally reluctant to believe the story. Instead, she decides to use the myth as a basis for her doctoral thesis. But as her investigations lead her to a recent murder which has been attributed to the Candyman, Helen's belief in what is possible and what is not is shaken. For she has uncovered a dark and sinister presence and soon finds herself the suspect in a murder enquiry. Based on a story by British horror maestro Clive Barker(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Bad Company</title>
    <desc lang="en">Dignified Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins tries the buddy action-comedy on for size with this typically slick and bombastic offering from producer Jerry Bruckheimer. Hopkins stars as Gaylord Oakes, a CIA spy attempting -- along with his partner, Kevin Pope (Chris Rock) -- to secure a suitcase-sized nuclear bomb in Prague from a Russian black marketer (Peter Stormare). Just as the partners discover that another bidder for the device exists, they are ambushed and Pope is killed trying to protect Oakes. Desperate for the bomb's owners and their attackers to believe that Pope is still alive so that the deal can commence in ten days time, Oakes recruits his late partner's long-lost twin, ticket-scalping chess hustler Jake Hayes (also played by Rock), a small-time criminal who never knew he had a brother. Offered a sizable payday and the admiration of his student nurse girlfriend, Hayes agrees to undergo vigorous training and dangerous situations as he impersonates his brother and helps Oakes to remove the nuclear threat, but the new partners clash in every way possible, from personal discipline to musical taste. Meanwhile, the assassin of the real Kevin Pope sends another cadre of killers after the agent he believes is still alive. Bad Company co-stars Kerry Washington, Garcelle Beauvais-Nilon, Gabriel Macht, and Matthew Marsh(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Inside</title>
    <desc lang="en">A solemn look at South African apartheid, Arthur Penn's claustrophobic drama centers on a pair of political interrogations, separated by a decade. The film's first part, set in 1988, centers on the imprisonment of Marty Strydom (Eric Stoltz), an Afrikaaner university professor held as a political prisoner under suspicion of conspiring with anti-government forces. His case falls into the hands of the villainous Colonel Kruger (Nigel Hawthorne), a brilliant and evil torturer determined to break the idealistic Strydom's spirit. The conclusion takes place nearly a decade later, after apartheid's fall. Now it is Krueger who is under confinement, and subjected to unrelenting questioning from a black South African (Louis Gossett Jr.) looking to beat Kruger at his own manipulative game. While offering numerous powerful confrontations between its characters, Bima Stagg's screenplay provides few narrative surprises, and some may find the film's limited setting and bare-bones treatments monotonous. However, Penn's stark style suits the harsh subject matter and keeps the focus strongly upon the cast, who provide appropriately intense performances(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</title>
    <desc lang="en">The third installment in the Spielberg/Lucas Indiana Jones saga, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade evokes many of the thrills of the first two efforts (Raiders of the Lost Ark and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom) without blatantly copying either of them. After a lengthy prologue in which we learn how young Indy (River Phoenix) first developed a taste for heart-pounding adventure -- and his lifelong fear of snakes -- we find the grown-up Jones (who else but Harrison Ford?) teaching his archeology classes in 1938. He is approached by an art collector (Julian Glover), who wants Jones to embark upon a search for the Holy Grail. It so happens that another archaeologist has disappeared while searching for the precious goblet; it so happens further that the missing man is Indy's own father, Dr. Henry Jones (marvelously portrayed by Sean Connery). What follows is a roller-coaster of thrills, whisking both the elder and the younger Joneses to Venice, Berlin, and the most treacherous regions of the Middle East. Complicating matters is the presence of lovely Alison Doody, whose attraction to Indy -- and his dad -- does not dissuade her from her loyalty to the Nazi party. As in Raiders of the Lost Ark, the much-sought-after religious artifact in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is not so easily found -- and even when it is discovered, its powers are a bit too much for those impure of heart. This Indiana Jones effort set a record by grossing $50 million in the first week of release(n)</desc>
