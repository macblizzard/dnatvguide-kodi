    <desc lang="en">In Cliffhanger, Sylvester Stallone plays Gabe Walker, a member of a mountain-climbing rescue team. Gabe is haunted by an incident from his past when he couldn't save the girlfriend of his best friend, Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker), from falling to her death. As the story begins, Gabe has left mountain-climbing rescue work and has set up business in Denver. He returns to the mountain rescue office to persuade his lover, Jessie (Janine Turner), to quit and come back to Denver with him. While he is begging Jessie to head out to Denver, things are happening in the skies overhead. A gang of professional crooks headed by psychotic Eric Qualen (John Lithgow) has hijacked a U.S. Treasury plane carrying millions of dollars. But the plane crashes, and the bad guys find themselves stranded on top of a mountain with the money (put into three cases) scattered around the wreckage and with no way to get down off the pinnacle to retrieve the cases. They put in a phony distress call that is received by the mountain rescue team. Gabe agrees to take part in one last rescue attempt, and they head up to help rescue the thieves. But Qualen has plans for the rescuers — to force them to climb through the dangerous snow-covered peaks to find the three suitcases of cash(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Cliffhanger</title>
    <desc lang="en">In Cliffhanger, Sylvester Stallone plays Gabe Walker, a member of a mountain-climbing rescue team. Gabe is haunted by an incident from his past when he couldn't save the girlfriend of his best friend, Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker), from falling to her death. As the story begins, Gabe has left mountain-climbing rescue work and has set up business in Denver. He returns to the mountain rescue office to persuade his lover, Jessie (Janine Turner), to quit and come back to Denver with him. While he is begging Jessie to head out to Denver, things are happening in the skies overhead. A gang of professional crooks headed by psychotic Eric Qualen (John Lithgow) has hijacked a U.S. Treasury plane carrying millions of dollars. But the plane crashes, and the bad guys find themselves stranded on top of a mountain with the money (put into three cases) scattered around the wreckage and with no way to get down off the pinnacle to retrieve the cases. They put in a phony distress call that is received by the mountain rescue team. Gabe agrees to take part in one last rescue attempt, and they head up to help rescue the thieves. But Qualen has plans for the rescuers — to force them to climb through the dangerous snow-covered peaks to find the three suitcases of cash(n)</desc>

Christian Bale returns to the role of Batman, Maggie Gyllenhaal takes over the role of Rachel Dawes (played by Katie Holmes in Batman Begins), and Brokeback Mountain star Heath Ledger dons the ghoulishly gleeful Joker makeup previously worn by Jack Nicholson and Cesar Romero. Just as it begins to appear as if Batman, Lt. James Gordon (Gary Oldman), and District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) are making headway in their tireless battle against the criminal element, a maniacal, wisecracking fiend plunges the streets of Gotham City into complete chaos(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Dizzy Detectives. Gorillas, both fake and (supposedly) real, play a big part in this amusing Three Stooges comedy two-reeler. The boys are policemen masquerading as night watchmen in an attempt to trap a burglar dressed in a gorilla suit. They catch a gorilla, all right, but the beast proves to be real. The denouement is appropriately violent; the ferocious simian blows up after ingesting nitroglycerin. John Tyrrell, probably Columbia Pictures' busiest character actor, earned a major spot in this two-reeler, playing the wanted burglar. The studio liked the plot enough to remake it twice: Fraidy Cat (1951) and Hook a Crook (1955), both starring Joe Besser, who in 1956, replaced Shemp Howard as the third Stooge(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Streatham Art Deco Flats.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The last quarter-final sees amateur designers transforming two rooms in 1930s art deco flats. One hopeful takes a risk by introducing a `mock crocodile' pattern to their client's gentlemen's club brief, while the other's butterfly-inspired effect seems a little too dominant. However, the challenge is really on for one designer when a possible asbestos outbreak means work has to be halted. Will they get finished on time? Presented by Tom Dyckhoff, with judges Kelly Hoppen and Daniel Hopwood.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Around the world there has been a huge increase in the number of children being referred to gender clinics - boys saying they want to be girls, and vice versa - while their parents are encouraged to fully support their change of identity. But is this the right approach? This World hears from Dr Kenneth Zucker, one of the world's leading experts in childhood gender dysphoria, who lost his job for challenging the belief that children know best.

    <sub-title lang="en">Forest.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Architect Piers Taylor and actress Caroline Quentin explore unusual homes built in or near areas of forest. After trips to properties near Madrid and the Catskill Mountains in New York State, they arrive in Piha, New Zealand, to a house built within an indigenous forest of pohutukawa trees. Navigating very strict environmental laws, this wooden-cladded and glass-roofed property mimics the branches of the surrounding trees, while its huge sliding glass walls open up to allow the surrounding forest to become an intrinsic part of the house itself.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">For the very first time the inner secrets of the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 are revealed in this landmark docudrama. It uses the actual words of the senior captured leader Thomas Wintour and Guy Fawkes as they responded to the state interrogators who were investigating the conspiracy by a Catholic-led group of militants to blow up Parliament and King James I, which had taken 18 months to plan. Also included is an insight into the recruitment of Fawkes and Wintour's brother right up to the dramatic siege that resulted in their capture on November 8. This epic tale reveals the plotters' faith, betrayal and persecution - and uncovers the truth behind a scheme whose ruination is celebrated every year.(n)</desc>

Since that day, more people have reached the summit of Everest than have matched Bannister's feat.

His story is told by Bannister himself, as well as his rival John Landy, Sebastian Coe, and Chris Chataway, who was Bannister's friend and pacesetter - among many others.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Solaris</title>
    <desc lang="en">A therapist travels to a distant space station to treat a group of astronauts traumatized by mysterious entities -- and ends up having to deal with an entity of his own -- in this second film version of Stanislaw Lem's philosophical sci-fi novel. Solaris stars George Clooney as Chris Kelvin, a psychologist still mourning the loss of his wife Rheya (Natascha McElhone) when he's implored by a colleague named Gibarian (Ulrich Tukur) to investigate the increasingly weird goings-on at the Prometheus space station. By the time Kelvin gets there, Gibarian has committed suicide, leaving only the cryptic, babbling Snow (Jeremy Davies) and the paranoid, guarded Gordon (Viola Davis), both of whom are holed up in their respective rooms. As Kelvin interrogates the skeleton crew, he learns that they've had unwanted "visitors," apparitions of long-dead friends, family, and loved ones who are apparently being generated by the interstellar energy source Solaris. The doctor is dubious of their claims until one night he, too, is greeted by his wife Rheya (Natascha McElhone), whose death still torments him. At first skeptical of the new Rheya, Kelvin gradually becomes obsessed with her -- and with the guilt that he feels over their troubled marriage -- to the point where the others begin to fear for his sanity. Produced by James Cameron, Solaris represented director Steven Soderbergh's first screenplay credit since the independently financed Schizopolis in 1996(n)</desc>

When he emerges, cyclops alien Leela (voice of Katey Sagal) is ordered to implant a chip in his hand for a life assignment. When he finds out that he's ordered to be a delivery boy again, he escapes. He is rightfully baffled by the future world and mistakes a suicide booth for a phone booth, where he meets the lovably debauched robot, Bender (voice of John DiMaggio). Fry and Bender go underground to the ruins of old New York, but Leela catches up with them. When Fry gives himself up, Leela decides to take out her life assignment chip and join them. They find Fry's only living relative, Professor Farnsworth (voice of Billy West), and get new jobs making deliveries with the Planet Express company in the Professor's space ship(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Around the Horn</title>
    <desc lang="en">Hosted--or rather, refereed--by boxing expert Max Kellerman, this lively cable-TV discussion show featured four sports columnists, each from a different part of the USA, discussing recent pro-athletic developments in a sort of electronic summit meeting. Kellerman determined how much time each of the columnists would be permitted to express his or her opinions--and he was harsh indeed, frequently limiting the discourse to ten seconds or less. At the end of the show, Kellerman would award points for the most cogent opinions and arguments, and also subtract points from contributors whom he determined had not effectively expressed themselves. The inagural episode of ESPN's Around the Horn was seen on September 30, 2002(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Professor Brian Cox travels around Australia to explore how the size of a creature is connected to the forces acting on its environment. From the safety of a steel cage, he faces a great white shark and explains how the streamlined contours of this massive predator have been shaped by the physics of water. In Queensland's rainforests, he explains how insects and other smaller creatures can appear to defy gravity, using electrostatic force to scale vertical windows.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">There's Something About Mary</title>
    <desc lang="en">After Dumb and Dumber and Kingpin , this was the Farrelly brothers' breakthrough movie, an all-round laugh-out-loud comedy of bad taste leavened by stand-out performances from a top-notch cast. Ben Stiller plays high school geek Ted, invited to the prom by the gorgeous Mary. He can hardly believe his luck; but the night goes wrong when he arrives to pick up his date, and has a painful accident in the toilet, failing to stow his tackle before zipping up. Thirteen years later Ted still yearns for what might have been and hires private dick Pat Healy to find Mary. The detective succeeds but also falls for her and feeds Ted false information so he can keep her for himself. But a suspicious Ted takes matters into his own hands and finds he's in the middle of a love pentagon also involving an architect and an NFL quarterback. Throw in gags involving a speed-freaked dog, Mary's use of what she believes is Ted's hair gel and a minstrel troupe who follow Ted around and you have a comedy that may not be subtle but is very, very funny(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This daily show-biz gossip and "expose" series was a spinoff of the popular interactive website TMZ, an acronym for the "Thirty Mile Zone" surrounding Hollywood. Created in 2005, TMZ had gained national prominence by breaking the story of Mel Gibson's anti-Semitic tirade after his arrest for drunken driving. By the time the TV version of TMZ premiered the week of September 10, 2007, the operation had once again scooped its scandal-rag competition with its coverage of O.J. Simpson's profanity-laden "invasion" of the home of a collectibles dealer who was allegedly selling Simpson memorabilia without permission. In fact, TMZ on TV had a wealth of celebrity-meltdown yarns to choose from during its shakedown week, ranging from the substance-abuse problems of Lindsay Lohan to the ill-fated "comeback" concert of Britney Spears. Harvey Levin, managing editor for both versions of TMZ, appeared on-camera as a correspondent, along with Sean Borg, Michael Hundgen, Katie Darryl and Teresa Strasser. TMZ on TV was seen primarily on local Fox or Fox-owned affiliates throughout the U.S(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Tarts.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The 10 remaining amateur cooks' tart-making abilities are put to the test in the third round of the competition. Their first task is to bake a tarte Tatin, with judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry looking for intriguing flavour combinations to tickle their tastebuds. The hopefuls then face another daunting technical challenge as they try to replicate Mary's seemingly straightforward recipe for treacle tart, but the delicate task of adding a lattice top leaves some contestants flummoxed. Finally, they try to create an ornate fruit tart fit for gracing the window display of a leading patisserie - before discovering the identities of the latest Star Baker and the person who will be heading home. Presented by Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins. From 2012.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Tarts.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The 10 remaining amateur cooks' tart-making abilities are put to the test in the third round of the competition. Their first task is to bake a tarte Tatin, with judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry looking for intriguing flavour combinations to tickle their tastebuds. The hopefuls then face another daunting technical challenge as they try to replicate Mary's seemingly straightforward recipe for treacle tart, but the delicate task of adding a lattice top leaves some contestants flummoxed. Finally, they try to create an ornate fruit tart fit for gracing the window display of a leading patisserie - before discovering the identities of the latest Star Baker and the person who will be heading home. Presented by Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins. From 2012.(n)</desc>

Oscar-nominated Exit Through the Gift Shop follows an eccentric shop-keeper turned amateur filmmaker as he attempts to capture many of the world's most infamous vandals on camera, only to have a British stencil artist named Banksy turn the camcorder back on its owner with wildly unexpected results. One of the most provocative films about art ever made, Exit Through the Gift Shop is a fascinating study of low-level criminality, comradeship and incompetence. By turns shocking, hilarious and absurd, this is an enthralling modern-day fairytale... with bolt cutters(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Drumline</title>
    <desc lang="en">After decades of movies about college sports, the bands who take the field at halftime finally get their day in the sun in this musical comedy drama. Devon Miles (Nick Cannon) is a talented young percussionist from Harlem who wins a music scholarship to Atlanta A &amp; T, a prestigious African-American university. For years, Atlanta A &amp; T has won awards for their show-style marching band, who combine expert musicianship (incorporating funk, R&amp;B, and jazz rhythms into the traditional marching band repertoire) with choreography, dancing cheerleaders, and roof-raising showmanship. Dr. Aaron Lee (Orlando Jones), the school's band director, gives Devon a spot in the marching band's drumline, the heart and soul of a show-style band, but discovers Devon's previous musical education hardly meets his usual standard when he learns that his new drummer can't read music. Devon soon earns a reputation as a stubborn individualist within the band, not necessarily a good thing in an ensemble where a strictly unified performance is considers the ideal. Devon's cocksure attitude and streetwise style doesn't mesh very comfortably with Sean Taylor (Leonard Roberts), a disciplined senior who resents the presence of the upstart freshman in the drumline, and things become even less harmonious when Devon begins making a play for Laila (Zoe Saldana), a beautiful girl who is also being courted by Sean. Songwriter and record producer Dallas Austin, who has worked with Boyz II Men, TLC, and Pink, served as executive producer for Drumline, helped produce the film's musical score, and contributed his own experiences as a marching band member to the screenplay(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Friday the 13th</title>
    <desc lang="en">(2009) Director Marcus Nispel seems to have a bit of a thing for remakes, having remoulded The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in 2003, as well as Conan the Barbarian in 2011. However, in this slasher horror, Nispel compresses elements of the first four films in the Friday the 13th franchise, which started way back in 1980, into one blood-sodden whole. This retread gives some background as to why Jason Voorhees (Derek Mears) became such a relentlessly homicidal maniac, before getting on with the business of steel on flesh and bucketloads of gore, delivering the movie's raison d'être. Some weeks after his sister goes missing, Clay Miller's (Jared Padalecki) search for his sibling leads him to Crystal Lake, a remote, wooded campsite. Also arriving at the spot is a group of young revellers, intent on partying. But it's not long before the man with the hockey mask and machete pays them a visit - one that any survivors are unlikely to forget. Can any of them escape Voorhees' latest murderous rampage? Or will they all vanish like Clay's sister and her friends?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The team heads to the small county of Rutland to visit Oakham Castle, the most well-preserved 12th-century building in Britain. It was once home to the Norman knight Walkelin de Ferrers, who fought alongside Richard the Lionheart in the Crusades, and before that the residence of several Saxon kings and queens. Tony and the crew investigate de Ferrers' long-lost private quarters, but it takes three days of twists and turns to determine what the site looked like 900 years ago. To mark the visit, they also cast a giant Time Team horseshoe to add to the collection that has decorated the castle hall for half a millennium.(n)</desc>

With unprecedented access inside prison walls, it discovers what it's like to live with the threat of the death chamber, as well as hearing from victims and their families, and the family of those on death row - some praying for execution, some hoping for a reprieve. Each episode focuses on a key aspect of the system - execution, trial and appeal. For two of the youngest men on death row in Texas, execution day has arrived. Victim Nikki Daniels reflects on her kidnapping ordeal by murderer Richard Cobb and battles with her conflicting desires to forgive him, while the mother of death row inmate Anthony Haynes fights to use the final 72 hours to halt her son's execution for the murder of a police officer(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Winged Seduction: Birds of Paradise</title>
    <desc lang="en">National Geographic photographer Tim Laman and ornithologist Ed Scholes have spent the better part of a decade sleeping in tents and dangling from the rain forest canopy to document all 39 species of Birds of Paradise. Their mission takes them into the jungles of one of last wild places on earth, New Guinea - where children carry machetes, women carry heavy loads and men carry on tribal warfare. Far-flung islands, impenetrable jungle and extreme elevations all create areas of isolation where ordinary birds have evolved into some of the most beautifully bizarre species on earth. Tim and Ed's first quarry on this expedition is Goldie's Bird of Paradise - a dazzling color-shaker that attracts females with a mating dance done in pairs. Rough seas, a flooded island and inaccurate scouting all stand in their way, but Tim and Ed make natural history filmmaking history by capturing a Goldie display with a remote controlled camouflaged camera. After a wild flight into the Huon Mountains, they search out Wahne's Parotia, a shape-shifter that transforms from bird to a feathered man in a skirt. Tim and Ed are after a scientific first - filming the Parotia from the female's perspective. Feathers that look like a skirt from the side, look like an oval from above, where the female audience members sit - no human has ever filmed it before. Digital explorers on an old-fashioned quest, Tim and Ed have survived everything the jungle has to throw at them to become first in the world to capture all 39 species of Birds of Paradise(n)</desc>

Pleasing discerning clients is nothing new to Mat and his team, but when he has an initial client meeting with the head of biology for the Rainforest Cafe, Jim, they quickly realize that in order to successfully accomplish this job they are going to have to be on their A-game. Jim is pedantic and demanding that the new corals be placed on the reef structure exactly how they would appear in nature. Meanwhile, a long-standing client is wanting a complete aquatic overhaul on his nearly decade old tank. In addition to replacing the current drab coral reef with a dynamic and colorful new one, Living Colors head of marine biology, Francis, must figure out a way to create a predator tank he wants without putting the other fish jeopardy. Will the Living Color team be able to please Jim and potentially be awarded more Rainforest Cafe business? And will Francis be able to select just the right fish in the appropriate sizes to ensure that all of the fish live in harmony?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Fish Upon a Star. Ben and Francis head out to meet up with a previous client, Max, who is looking for a massive upgrade in a tank - he wants one three to four times the size of his current aquarium. He already maintains the environment he currently has and wants to do so again, but this time he wants a live coral tank that will be so massive it will be one of the largest residential tanks of its kind in Southern Florida. Ben is all business and Francis is in heaven talking to another marine enthusiast. Since this tank is all about the fragile corals its up to Francis to impress upon Max the importance of properly caring for them. With the specialized filtration system and the actual tank, the entire aquarium runs in the ballpark of $40,000. Then, its up to Mat and Ben to take on a new client, former Miami Heat star, Alonzo Mourning. Upon arriving at Alonzos home, they see he already has an aquarium. The basketball sensation explains that he does in fact want an aquarium, but not for his home, for a youth center he started that helps at risk youth. Alonzo wants the aquarium to be a source of education, responsibility and tranquility for them(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Ross travels to Northern Ireland to find that, more than 15 years after the Good Friday peace agreement, the country is still deeply divided. Setting out to discover what makes people on both sides reluctant to let go of the past, he meets taxi drivers who offer tours of the sites of the Troubles, sees the towering `peace walls' that keep the different communities apart and witnesses a peak in the violence during the July marching season. He also accompanies police officers to see how they try to keep the peace as the bottles and bricks rain down on the first of four nights of protest.(n)</desc>

Johnstone also played in that final while just 18, slotting in at centre-half as a replacement for Ronnie McKinnon and Colin Jackson, despite the fact he normally played as a striker.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Tenderness</title>
    <desc lang="en">Adapted from the novel by Robert Cormier, this psychological crime drama tells the tense story of an obsessed police lieutenant who's on the hunt for a dangerous young killer. The first thing most people notice about handsome high school student Eric Komenko (Jon Foster) is his easy charm. But that charm doesn't run deep, because a closer look reveals a cold-blooded killer. When Eric's devoutly religious mother discovers that her son has been sleeping around, the teen responds to her maternal scolding by viciously slaughtering both she and his father. The man assigned to Eric's case, Lt. Cristofuoro (Russell Crowe), believes that the young psychopath will kill again if given the opportunity. Lt. Cristofuoro knows that Eric has had a rough life, but he's determined to catch him before his murderous impulses once again take over. As Eric hits the road to Syracuse in search of a girl he met in juvenile detention, he is surprised to find Lori Cranston hiding in his truck. A tragic victim of sexual abuse, Lori knows what Eric is capable of, yet remains steadfast in her devotion to him. The crueler Eric is to Lori, the more she desires him. Later, as Lt. Cristofuoro closes in on the pair, Lori embraces her fate as Eric's next victim, and gives herself to him without struggle. But Eric is more interested in the girl from juvenile detention than he is with Lori. Little does the young killer realize that he's walking straight into a carefully set trap(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Meat Loaf: In and Out of Hell</title>
    <desc lang="en">Profile of rock superstar Meat Loaf. Since the release of the Bat Out of Hell album in 1977, Meat Loaf has possessed the kind of international status that few artists obtain. His larger-than-life persona and performances are fuelled by a passion for theatre and storytelling. This candid profile reveals the man and his music through his own testimony and from the accounts of those closest to him. Meat Loaf's life story is one of epic proportions - he survived a childhood of domestic violence only to face years of record company rejection, before eventually finding global fame. Along the way he experienced bankruptcy, health scares, bust-ups and one of the greatest comebacks of all time. All this and more is explored in the film, which features behind-the-scenes footage of his recent Las Vegas residency, plus plans for a new album featuring songs by Jim Steinman(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Tenderness</title>
    <desc lang="en">Adapted from the novel by Robert Cormier, this psychological crime drama tells the tense story of an obsessed police lieutenant who's on the hunt for a dangerous young killer. The first thing most people notice about handsome high school student Eric Komenko (Jon Foster) is his easy charm. But that charm doesn't run deep, because a closer look reveals a cold-blooded killer. When Eric's devoutly religious mother discovers that her son has been sleeping around, the teen responds to her maternal scolding by viciously slaughtering both she and his father. The man assigned to Eric's case, Lt. Cristofuoro (Russell Crowe), believes that the young psychopath will kill again if given the opportunity. Lt. Cristofuoro knows that Eric has had a rough life, but he's determined to catch him before his murderous impulses once again take over. As Eric hits the road to Syracuse in search of a girl he met in juvenile detention, he is surprised to find Lori Cranston hiding in his truck. A tragic victim of sexual abuse, Lori knows what Eric is capable of, yet remains steadfast in her devotion to him. The crueler Eric is to Lori, the more she desires him. Later, as Lt. Cristofuoro closes in on the pair, Lori embraces her fate as Eric's next victim, and gives herself to him without struggle. But Eric is more interested in the girl from juvenile detention than he is with Lori. Little does the young killer realize that he's walking straight into a carefully set trap(n)</desc>

According to Chinese legend, the dead return to Earth on the seventh month of the lunar year, when the moon glows full in the night sky. America-born Yul (Tim Chiou) and his new wife Melissa (Amy Smart) had just arrived in China to meet Yul's family when their idyllic getaway takes a sudden turn for the worse. When night falls and their tour guide leaves them stranded in a darkened, boarded-up village, Yul and Amy quickly realize that this wasn't a planned stop. Once a year, the lunar creatures return to Earth in search of a sacrifice. Yul and Amy have just been offered up, and now in order to avoid being assimilated into the collective that pursues them through the darkened forest, they will have to survive until the morning light casts the frightful beasts back to the moon for another year(n)</desc>

Fifteen years ago, an elusive serial killer known as The Wolf claimed the lives of 15 young girls. Thanks to the work of Detectives Elliott Carbon (John Rhys-Davies) and Johnny Morgan ( Andrew Cymek), The Wolf was eventually captured, locked up, and placed in the care of Dr. Parker (William B. Davis). When the facility loses power and the lights go dark, however, The Wolf and the rest of the inmates seize the opportunity to reclaim their freedom. Now trapped in these winding corridors with a rampaging gang of maniacs, madmen, and murderers, Johnny and Dr. Parker must fight to survive the night, and ensure that no one escapes before order is restored(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Adapted from the novel by Robert Cormier, this psychological crime drama tells the tense story of an obsessed police lieutenant who's on the hunt for a dangerous young killer. The first thing most people notice about handsome high school student Eric Komenko (Jon Foster) is his easy charm. But that charm doesn't run deep, because a closer look reveals a cold-blooded killer. When Eric's devoutly religious mother discovers that her son has been sleeping around, the teen responds to her maternal scolding by viciously slaughtering both she and his father. The man assigned to Eric's case, Lt. Cristofuoro (Russell Crowe), believes that the young psychopath will kill again if given the opportunity. Lt. Cristofuoro knows that Eric has had a rough life, but he's determined to catch him before his murderous impulses once again take over. As Eric hits the road to Syracuse in search of a girl he met in juvenile detention, he is surprised to find Lori Cranston hiding in his truck. A tragic victim of sexual abuse, Lori knows what Eric is capable of, yet remains steadfast in her devotion to him. The crueler Eric is to Lori, the more she desires him. Later, as Lt. Cristofuoro closes in on the pair, Lori embraces her fate as Eric's next victim, and gives herself to him without struggle. But Eric is more interested in the girl from juvenile detention than he is with Lori. Little does the young killer realize that he's walking straight into a carefully set trap(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Money and emotions lead to a difficult reunion between a father and daughter in this drama. Reese Holden (Zooey Deschanel) is a struggling stage actress in New York City whose life has become an uphill struggle -- her career isn't giving her satisfaction, her relationship with would-be rock star Ray (Dallas Roberts) is stuck in neutral, an affair with her friend Rob (Robert Beitzel) brings no excitement, and her colleague Deirdre (Deirdre O'Connell) simply doesn't understand her problems. Reese is also short on money, which is why she's willing to listen to a proposal from a publisher who wants to release a series of love letters that her mother, a well-known author who died years ago, wrote to her father, Don (Ed Harris), another respected novelist who has fallen out of the limelight but is said to be working on a final major work. Having accepted an advance for the collection, Reese pays a visit to Don in Michigan to get his OK for the project and collect the letters, but discovers two strangers have moved in with Don -- Shelly (Amelia Warner), who studied under Don and has installed herself as his business manager, and Corbit (Will Ferrell), a neighborhood sad sack who helps with the housekeeping and runs errands for the reclusive writer. As Reese vies with Shelly for her father's attention, she struggles to come to terms with issues from her childhood and the dissatisfaction with her life. Winter Passing was written and directed by noted playwright Adam Rapp; it was his first feature film(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Cinderella Man</title>
    <desc lang="en">The true story of an athlete who achieved his greatest success against the most daunting odds of his life is brought to the screen in this historical drama. In the 1920s, James Braddock (Russell Crowe) from Bergen, NJ, was a promising contender in professional boxing; he had strength, spirit, and tenacity, but the combination of a serious hand injury and a 1929 defeat in a bout with light heavyweight champ Tommy Loughran sent his career into a serious tailspin. As Braddock's career in the ring dried up, the Great Depression put a stake through the heart of America's economy, and Braddock found himself working at the New York docks for pitiful wages as he tried to support his wife, Mae (Renée Zellweger), and three children. Desperate for money, Braddock turned to his former trainer and manager Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti), who was unexpectedly able to scare up a bout for him, battling John Griffin at Madison Square Garden. While conventional wisdom had it that Braddock was too old, out of shape, and out of practice to have any chance of winning, he defeated Griffin, and continued beating his opponents with a powerful left hook that had been intensified by years of punishing dock work. In a nation desperate for good news, Braddock's surprising comeback became a tonic to struggling workers and unemployed people, and all eyes were on Braddock when in 1935 he took on powerful heavyweight champion Max Baer (Craig Bierko) in what was both literally and figuratively the fight of his life(n)</desc>

Determined to salvage their troubled relationship, Jenn's boyfriend Alex (Jeff Roop) takes them to a secluded campsite near a scenic lake where he used to play as a child.

    <title lang="en">Total Recall</title>
    <desc lang="en">In Paul Verhoeven's wild sci-fi action movie Total Recall, Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a 21st-century construction worker who discovers that his entire memory of the past derives from a memory chip implanted in his brain. Schwarzenegger learns that he's actually a secret agent who had become a threat to the government, so those in power planted the chip and invented a domestic lifestyle for him. Once he has realized his true identity, he travels to Mars to piece together the rest of his identity, as well as to find the man responsible for his implanted memory. Verhoeven has created a fast, furious action film with Total Recall, filled with impressive stunts and (literally) eye-popping visuals. Though the film bears only a passing resemblance to the Philip K. Dick short story it was based on ("We Can Remember It For You Wholesale"), the movie is an entertaining, if very violent, ride(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Layer Cake</title>
    <desc lang="en">Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels producer Matthew Vaughn kicked off his directorial career with this crime thriller starring Daniel Craig, Sienna Miller and Michael Gambon. Craig plays an unnamed gentleman drug dealer (well, all things are relative in his line of work) who, landed with an astonishingly lucrative job, spies his opportunity to retire relatively unscathed from the business. However, before he can do so, his boss Jimmy Price asks him to track down the missing daughter of another gangster, Eddie Temple, and as Temple's of an even nastier temperament than Price it's not a request he can easily refuse. And once he embarks on his task, complications begin to stack upon each other in much the manner of the confection that gives the film its title - though rather than some lovely sponge, cream and berries, this one consists of brutal henchmen, drug deals gone bad and violent bloodletting(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A massive corporate conglomerate, Octopus Inc., run by a shrewd and cruel tycoon named Rod McCain, purchases a UK-based leisure company, and also the failing London Marwood Zoo. To bring more business to the zoo, Octopus hires a new manager, Rollo Lee, who promptly comes up with a way to increase profits-do away with all the animals except for the ferocious ones. This new Fierce Creatures Policy shocks the Marwood zookeepers, led by the unendingly talkative Adrian "Bugsy" Malone. Eventually, Rod McCain's son Vince, along with the up-and-coming business executive Willa Weston, take control of the zoo and revoke the Fierce Creatures Policy. Vince instead comes up with many under-handed and vicious schemes to attract customers-unauthorized celebrity endorsements, shoddy, overpriced zoo merchandise, and using robotic animals instead of real ones. However, Vince is also stealing from the zoo's funds, and when his father finds out, he rears to turn the zoo into a Japanese-owned golf course. Meanwhile, Willa has grown to love the zoo and its animals, and, along with her newly-reformed love interest Rollo, plot with the zookeepers to save the zoo from the McCains(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Working Girl</title>
    <desc lang="en">Working Girl is a sparkling, entertaining comedy splendidly directed by Mike Nichols that takes a refreshing new slant on the familiar "ambitious secretary who makes good" story. Tess (Melanie Griffith) is a smart, resourceful woman who has trouble fitting in the corporate world. Smarter than her bosses and unwilling to trade sexual favors in order to advance, Tess is assigned to work for Katherine Parker (Sigourney Weaver). Tess quickly becomes indispensable to Katherine, and when Katherine breaks her leg in a skiing accident, Tess steps in and takes over. While doing some work for Katherine in her home, Tess discovers that Katherine has stolen an idea that Tess had shown her for a new proposal for an important client. Tess infuriated and discouraged by the betrayal pretends to be Katherine and, aided by Jack Trainer (Harrison Ford) who doesn't know of her deception, sells the idea to the client. When Katherine returns she discovers what Tess has done and has her fired. Tess manages to prove that the ideas were stolen from her by Katherine and also win the love of Jack who, unknown to Tess, was also Katherine's fiance.Melanie Griffith gives a standout comic performance as Tess, who manages to succeed without sleeping with the boss. Smart, sexy and shrewd, Melanie Griffith proves herself to be an excellent actress with perfect comedic timing. Harrison Ford and Sigourney Weaver are also excellent and bring depth and intelligence to roles which could easily have become stereotypes.Mike Nichols again proves himself to be an expert director of comedy, getting outstanding performances from all of his cast and giving the story tension, excitement and humor. Griffith, Nichols and Weaver were all nominated for Academy awards, as was Joan Cusackwho shines in a hilarious, stand-out performance as Tess's best friend. While criticized by some as a "feel-good" movieWorking Girl stands as a fine, optimistic, touching comedy which shows that a woman can succeed by using her brains(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Deliver Us From Eva</title>
    <desc lang="en">Three men discover that meddling in their sister-in-law's love life only makes their own lives more complicated in this romantic comedy. Eva Dandridge (Gabrielle Union) developed a sense of responsibility early on in life, when after the death of her parents she was left to care for her three younger sisters, Kareenah (Essence Atkins), Bethany (Robinne Lee), and Jacqui (Meagan Good). All four of the Dandridge sisters have grown up to be attractive, intelligent, and successful; Kareenah is happily married to Tim (Mel Jackson), while Bethany is engaged to Michael (Duane Martin), and Jacqui is going steady with Darrell (Dartanyan Edmonds). However, Eva still watches over her siblings like a hawk, and while her sisters love Eva dearly, Tim, Michael, and Darrell wish their sister-in-law would stay out of their business. The guys decide that if Eva had a boyfriend, she might be less interested in running other people's lives, and they turn to Ray (LL Cool J), a notorious ladies' man, for help. Ray is short on cash, so the guys make him a deal -- they'll give him 5,000 dollars to romance Eva, sweep her off her feet, and then dump her a few weeks later. Ray agrees, and while getting past her no-nonsense demeanor takes some doing, before long she's head over heels for him. However, Ray unexpectedly finds himself falling in love with Eva, and Eva, when offered a job in another town, decides to stay on to be with Ray. Even worse, the other Dandridge sisters are so impressed with the romantic Ray that they start demanding a bit more TLC from their own men(n)</desc>

Somehow, some way, Lanser knows that the ship and its passengers are doomed to a watery grave, but no one will believe him. As it turns out, Lanser has "inside information" -- without giving the game away, it can be said that he is his own executioner. Future TV-series stars Patrick Macnee and James Franciscus appear in significant supporting roles. Written by Rod Serling and first telecast December 4, 1959, "Judgment Night" represents one of the few times that Twilight Zone ran into sponsorial interferences -- instead of drinking tea, the ship's very British crew consumes coffee, as prescribed by sponsor General Foods(n)</desc>

The weekend is ruined when all three ladies simultaneously have their periods! Listen for the reference to series star Ed O'Neill's first film Deliverance. Intended as the third-season opener, "A Period Piece" became a nationwide cause celebre when its subject matter ran afoul of the Fox network censors. Ultimately, however, the episode was telecast more and less intact, though its title was changed to "The Camping Show" (a pointless gesture, in that the series' episode titles were never shown onscreen) and it was aired one hour later than its usual 8:30 p.m. time slot(n)</desc>

With Children, in which Peg (Katey Sagal) and Al (Ed O'Neill) spend a weekend at the sleazy Hop-On-In Motel. Tuning in to an X-rated cable station, the Bundys are surprised to see their own neighbors Steve (David Garrison) and Marcy (Amanda Bearse) in a porno film. It turns out that the motel has been secretly videotaping the sexual shenanigans of its guests -- including the Bundys. Outraged, Al and Peg join Steve and Marcy in filing suit against the hotel owners, with surprising (and humiliating!) results. Although this episode was slated to air in February of 1989, the Fox network would not approve the final version, which had an unprecedented 15 "censor notes." As a result, "I'll See You in Court" was not broadcast on the United States until it was run by cable's FX service on June 18, 2002 -- over 13 years after it was taped(n)</desc>

In trying to figure out the extent of baby Wyatt's powers -- and, eventually, to take over those powers herself -- the Crone (Grace Zabriskie) imposes the Curse of the Monkey Totem on the Charmed Ones. As a result, each girl loses one of her senses: Phoebe (Alyssa Milano) is deaf ("Hear no evil"), Piper (Holly Marie Combs) is blind ("See no evil"), and Paige (Rose McGowan) is mute ("Speak no evil"). In addition to compounding the girls' domestic, professional, and personal problems, their afflictions also leave little Wyatt defenseless -- or so it seems. Despite being unable to speak throughout most of the episode, Paige manages to belt out a rendition of Peggy Lee's "Fever."(n)</desc>
