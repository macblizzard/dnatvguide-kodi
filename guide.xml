It's difficult to tell whose behaviour is worse, the children or the 'adults', but a battle of wills ensues, which will have a meaningful outcome for each of the quartet..(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A disgraced Dominican cop fights to clear his name and avenge his father's death in this gritty revenge thriller from director Joshua Crook (Salvage, Rockaway). Luisito's father was an honest butcher who valued hard work. He was a positive role model for a kid from the slums, and Luisito's life was forever changed when notorious drug dealer Rafa (Paul Calderon) shot him down in cold blood. Flash-forward two decades, and Luisito is doing his part to keep the Dominican Republic safe from the criminal element. He's been carefully molded into the perfect crime fighter thanks to the charismatic General Colon (Juan Fernández), who exploited Luisito's childhood trauma before inducting him into the secret police. As a young boy, Luisito fell deeply in love with Jenny. But when Jenny's family moved to New York shortly after Luisito's father was killed, they lost touch. Now, Jenny (Denise Quiñones) is back in the Dominican Republic, and her feelings for Luisito are stronger than ever. If only Luisito could find a way to tell her about his work, perhaps they could find a way to make love work. Unfortunately for Luisito and Jenny, an investigation into General Colon's recent activities reveals an epic betrayal, and sets the stage for a tragic confrontation(n)</desc>

Gene Hackman and Roy Scheider play detectives James 'Popeye' Doyle and Buddy Russo who, while investigating relatively minor-league drugs pushers, learn that a massive shipment of very pure heroin is about to arrive in the city. The heroin is being imported from Marseille by Alain Charnier, who is prepared to do anything, including murdering policemen, to get his narcotics out on the streets. But, although they know it's on its way, Doyle and Russo don't know how. Additionally, they make life more difficult for themselves by their warring with FBI agent Mulderig, who's also working the case. Hickman was the stunt driver pursued by Steve McQueen in Bullitt; and was also behind the wheel for the famous chase in this movie, which was shot in real traffic(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Sue Barker presents coverage of the ladies' singles final between Garbine Muguruza and Venus Williams at the All England Club. Muguruza's previous two Grand Slam finals were both against Venus' sister Serena, and she experienced mixed fortunes in them. She lost the first one here in 2015, before gaining revenge in the French Open last year. Her 37-year-old opponent has become the oldest Grand Slam singles finalist since Martina Navratilova finished runner-up here in 1994, and is looking for her sixth Wimbledon title, but her first since 2008.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Marin Cilic v Roger Federer. Sue Barker presents coverage of the men's singles final on Centre Court at SW19. Croatian Cilic has reached only his second Grand Slam final, having previously appeared in - and won - the showpiece match at the 2014 US Open. Legendary Swiss player Federer is looking for a record eighth triumph at Wimbledon, and 19th Major overall. Home favourite Andy Murray picked up his second Wimbledon title here in 2016, defeating Canada's sixth seed Milos Raonic 6-4, 7-6, 7-6 to claim his third major title overall, following his famous triumph here over Novak Djokovic in 2013 and the 2012 US Open, when he defeated the same player in the final. The Scot is currently world number one and came into this tournament as top seed, so hopes were high a fortnight ago for another strong run at his home event.(n)</desc>

In the midst of a hard-fought race for the White House, the Democratic presidential and vice-presidential candidates are killed in an airline crash, and with little time to prepare a new campaign, the Republican candidate, Vice President Brian Lewis (Nick Searcy), seems all but guaranteed to win. With practically nothing to loose, party head Martin Geller (Dylan Baker) approaches Gilliam and asks him to stand as the Democrat's presidential candidate. While Gilliam is dubious at first, before long his streetwise style and willingness to face the issues head-on earns him surprising figures in the polls, especially after he persuades his short-fused older brother, Mitch Gilliam (Bernie Mac), to join the ticket as vice presidential candidate -- a big jump for a bail bondsman. Gilliam's love life also becomes more complicated as his ex-girlfriend Kim (Robin Givens) decides she wants him back now that he has a shot at the White House, even though Gilliam only has eyes for Lisa (Tamala Jones). Head of State marked the directorial debut for comic and actor Chris Rock, who also co-wrote and co-produced the film(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A young artist struggling with his career and his muse is getting more than a little aggravation from Cupid in this romantic comedy written and directed by Woody Allen. Jerry Falk (Jason Biggs) is a promising 21-year-old comedy writer living in New York City. While Jerry has talent, he's having a hard time getting his career off the ground, which might have something to do with the fact his agent Harvey (Danny DeVito) is a well-meaning, but ineffectual, blowhard, and his mentor David Dobel (Allen) is an increasingly paranoid eccentric whose twin careers as a teacher and standup comic are both floundering. Poised at the top of Jerry's mountain of anxieties is his relationship with his girlfriend Amanda (Christina Ricci); from the first moment he saw her, Jerry has been in love with her, but Amanda's multiple neuroses, fear of commitment, and frustrating intimacy issues make her all but impossible to be around. Jerry is approaching his breaking point when the small flat he shares with Amanda becomes home to a third roommate -- Amanda's mother Paula (Stockard Channing), who has decided to come to New York to chase her dream of becoming a cabaret singer. Anything Else also features supporting performances from Jimmy Fallon, William Hill, and jazz vocalist Diana Krall(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Man on the Moon</title>
    <desc lang="en">Comedian Andy Kaufman gave performances that were bizarre and difficult to categorize, in which he might do or say almost anything: show cartoons, impersonate Elvis Presley, play conga drums while singing children's songs, read aloud from The Great Gatsby, or take the audience out for milk and cookies. Written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski and directed by Milos Forman (the team behind The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996)), this biopic takes an in-depth look at Kaufman's life and art, with Jim Carrey as Kaufman, who could (and would) be any number of different people onstage: the quiet and childlike man, the little foreign guy, the overbearing showbiz "professional," the violently obnoxious wrestler, or the world's worst lounge singer. As Kaufman rose from comedy clubs to guest appearances on Saturday Night Live and a spot on the TV sitcom Taxi, his performances became more complex and dangerous -- so much so that when word got out in 1984 that he was suffering from lung cancer, many fans and associates thought it was just another bizarre stunt; the disease took his life later that year. Man on the Moon features Danny De Vito as Kaufman's manager George Shapiro, Courtney Love as his girlfriend Lynne Margulies, Paul Giamatti as his friend Bob Zmuda, and David Letterman, Judd Hirsch, Marilu Henner, Carol Kane, and Christopher Lloyd as themselves(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Castle Ghosts of Scotland</title>
    <desc lang="en">Castle Ghosts of Scotland explores the eerie grounds of three of Scotland's most haunted castles: Glamis, Duntrune, and Fyvie. With a history every bit as bloody and treacherous as Shakespeare's +MacBeth, it's no wonder Scotland has so many ghosts. The childhood home of England's Queen Mother, Glamis Castle is reputed to be the most haunted castle in the United Kingdom -- despite resembling the Disney castle. In 1537, King James V accused the young and beautiful Lady Glamis of witchcraft. Burned at the stake, the ghost known as the "Grey Lady of Glamis" haunts the castle to this day. As the program travels to Aberdeenshire, Fyvie Castle's "Green Lady" ghost is revealed to be Dame Lillias Drummond, who was starved to death by her husband, Sir Alexander Seton. In 1615 during a feud between the McDonalds and the Campbells, a piper loyal to the McDonald clan had his fingers chopped off by the Campbells and bled to death. Current owners of the castle report strange knocking on doors, the sound of footsteps running -- and late at night, the soft strains of bagpipes being played in the tower(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Documentary in which three people who were the lone survivors of aircraft crashes discuss their ordeals, detailing the conflicting emotions they experienced after realising everyone else on board had died. D-Day veteran Phil Bradley was trapped in his seat for 36 hours after the plane he was travelling on crashed in Virginia in 1959, while Annette Herfkens drank rainwater to stay alive after a Vietnam Airlines jet crashed into a mountain in 1992. Juliane Koepcke, meanwhile, tells of being lost for 10 days in the Peruvian rainforest after a plane crash in 1971, and how her knowledge of jungle terrain helped to save her life.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Kung Fu Hustle</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Stephen Chow made his name in this country with the deliriously wonderful Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle continues his love of comedy kung-fu films. Set in pre-revolutionary China, Chow plays Sing, a street hustler who makes the mistake of pretending to be a member of the notorious Axe gang. He becomes caught up in a war between the gang and the residents of Pig Sty Alley, which the gang want to take over. Little do they know that two of the Alley's residents are retired martial arts experts and soon the fists and feet are flying in knockabout fights that owe as much to Kill Bill (some of the wire work is done by Yuen Wo Ping, who worked on Tarantino's film) as they do to classic Hollywood silent comedies. Film fans can enjoy Chow's references to films ranging from Top Hat to The Shining while the rest can just enjoy a wildly entertaining romp. In Cantonese with English subtitles(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">40-Year-Old Virgin star Steve Carell steps into the telephonic shoes of television's most beloved bumbling detective in this big-screen adaptation of the hit 1960s-era comedy series created by Mel Brooks.

With no real field experience to speak of and nothing but sheer enthusiasm and a handful of fancy spy gadgets to help him accomplish his deadly mission, Maxwell Smart his new partner, Agent 99, will be forced to faces malevolent KAOS head Siegfried (Terence Stamp) and his loyal army of minions in a decisive fight that will determine the fate of the free world.

Maya Dolittle (Kyla Pratt), the youngest daughter of veterinarian John Dolittle, makes the surprising discovery that, like her dad, she can understand what animals have to say, and speak with them in their own language. Unlike her father, Maya hasn't found a suitable use for her talents, and as she finds an outlet for her unique language skills, she is sent away to Durango, a combination summer camp and dude ranch, where she strikes up a rapport with both the fellow campers and the livestock. When she learns that Durango is on the verge of going out of business due to money problems, Maya starts working with the camp's horses and cattle, giving them a much needed pep talk as they're entered in a local rodeo that could save Durango. Dr. Dolittle 3: The Daughter Is In also features Kristen Wilson, John Amos, and Walker Howard(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Hotel for Dogs</title>
    <desc lang="en">Adapted from author Lois Duncan's 1971 children's book of the same name, director Thor Freudenthal's Hotel for Dogs follows two mischievous orphans as they attempt to hide dozens of stray dogs in an abandoned hotel. Disheartened by their new guardians' announcement that pets are strictly forbidden, 16-year-old Andi (Emma Roberts) and her younger brother, Bruce (Jake T. Austin), race to find a home for their loyal dog Friday. Fortunately for Friday, there's an abandoned hotel just around the corner, and Bruce possesses just the kind of mechanical smarts needed to transform the rundown inn into a four-star retreat for canines.

    <desc lang="en">A single father who has just found success as the host of an outrageous television talk show begins to question his path in life when he returns home to attend his parents' 50th wedding anniversary party in the company of his famous fiancée -- a reality television star -- in this crisis-of-conscience comedy starring Martin Lawrence. RJ Stevens (Lawrence) is a television talk-show sensation who has transcended his modest Southern beginnings to become the most popular self-help guru ever to grace the small screen. His show, "Team of Me," is a ratings juggernaut, his fiancée is a beautiful reality television star, and his pockets are always lined with large bills. There are few Tinseltown dreams that RJ hasn't already achieved, so when his parents announce their 50th wedding anniversary, the family-oriented television star immediately drops everything and sets his sights on Georgia. As a boy, RJ was always the target of ridicule within his family, but these days things are different; not only does RJ have a ten-year-old son, but his bride-to-be is admired by countless viewers all across the globe on a weekly basis. But RJ's egotistical West Coast attitude simply doesn't fly in the South, and when his lovable but relentless family refuses to cut him any slack due to his current superstar status, he must finally pause and take stock of the man he has become. Louis C.K., Cedric the Entertainer, Michael Clarke Duncan, and James Earl Jones co-star in a Southern-flavored family comedy written and directed by Malcolm D. Lee(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Scream 3</title>
    <desc lang="en">Wes Craven's Scream (1996) was a half-parody/half-tribute to the first wave of slasher films of the 1970s and 1980s, and since most of them spawned a large number of sequels, it's only appropriate that Craven and screenwriter Kevin Williamson produced a third installment of their Scream franchise. Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), traumatized by the brutal murders of her friends, has left her hometown of Woodsboro and is working in California as a crisis intervention counselor. Meanwhile, "Stab," the novel by Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox Arquette), is spawning a series of successful horror films, and as Stab 3: Return to Woodsboro is being filmed in Los Angeles, a lunatic has gotten his hands on a copy of the script, and is murdering the characters in the same order that they die in the movie. But predicting who will die next is not as simple as it might seem, since the producers have circulated three different screenplays, with different endings. In addition to Campbell and Cox-Arquette, David Arquette returns from the first two films as less-than-bright "Dewey" Riley; new members of the cast include Parker Posey, Patrick Dempsey, Scott Foley, and Jenny McCarthy. Kevin Williamson wrote the original story, but the screenplay was penned by Ehren Kruger(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">After the highly acclaimed independent film Bottle Rocket, director Wes Anderson followed up with a quirky Touchstone Studios film entitled Rushmore. Written by Anderson and friend Owen Wilson (an actor in Armageddon and Anaconda), they created the story of Max Fischer, a highly eccentric 15-year-old boy who attends the tenth grade at Rushmore Academy. Played by Jason Schwartzman (Talia Shire's son and Francis Ford Coppola's nephew), Max is a poor student with big dreams and a love of extracurricular activities. Max is editor of the school newspaper and yearbook, president of the chess, astronomy, French, and German clubs, captain of the fencing team, and director of the school play. Max is also a compulsive liar, telling everyone that his barber father (Seymour Cassel) is really a brain surgeon. Suddenly Max falls in love with Miss Cross (Olivia Williams), a first-grade teacher at the school. He also makes a new friend in business tycoon Mr. Blume (Bill Murray), an eccentric millionaire who also loves Miss Cross. The love triangle heats up as Max refuses to believe that his age has anything to do with Miss Cross refusing his romantic advances. Also Max's scheme to erect an aquarium on the school baseball diamond gets him booted out of Rushmore Academy. As his life crumbles around him, he is forced to grow up and accept the consequences of his actions and his lies. He throws himself more into his extracurricular activities, hoping to redeem himself by staging the most ambitious school play ever attempted(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A bunch of college students are stranded in a small town where suffering for art takes on a whole new meaning in this tale of terror. Carly (Elisha Cuthbert) and her boyfriend, Wade (Jared Padalecki), have hit the road with a handful of their friends to attend a championship college football game; tagging along with them are Carly's bratty friend Paige (Paris Hilton, Carly's trouble-making twin brother Nick (Chad Michael Murray), and Blake (Robert Ri'chard), Paige's latest boy toy. While camping out for the night, the gang makes the mistake of getting on the wrong side of a mysterious local redneck, and the next morning they discover that Wade's car no longer works. As the others continue on to the big game, Carly and Wade make their way into the closest town, Ambrose, and discover it's all but deserted, except for a local tourist attraction, the House of Wax. However, it isn't long before they find out why the wax sculptures at the museum look so freakishly real, and discover a pair of murderous brothers are keen on making them part of the next exhibit. House of Wax is an in-name-only remake of the well-remembered 1953 3-D horror outing starring Vincent Price, which was in turn based on the 1933 picture Mystery of the Wax Museum(n)</desc>

She then suffered a severe nervous breakdown, which led to spells in mental hospitals and experimental treatment from psychiatrists including Sigmund Freud. The trauma had a shattering effect on her marriage and led to a fractured childhood for her only son.

    <desc lang="en">Secret History documentary telling the inside story of the dynastic tensions that were unleashed when Princess Elizabeth, the future queen, fell in love with Prince Philip. It was felt that Philip was rough and ill-mannered - and with the Second World War still fresh in most people's minds, the royal and political elite disliked his German roots. But following the death of King George VI in 1952, the establishment feared a dynastic coup, with the Queen torn between the two sides. The documentary examines the complexities and frustrations of the royal marriage, as the monarch struggled to reconcile the love of her husband with the suspicions of her family and her government.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Matt Lucas returns to narrate another light-hearted retrospective poking fun at Britain's viewing habits in the 1970s. This time, he focuses on the world of comedy, unfettered as it was to the conventions of political correctness. A selection of clips from hit TV shows illustrate how, if viewers were not straight, white, middle-class men, they were at risk of being offended, and highlights examples from On the Buses, The Two Ronnies, Dave Allen at Large and The Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club. Includes commentary and contributions by Melvyn Hayes, Eric Chappell, Bill Oddie, Krishnan Guru-Murthy, Grace Dent, Nish Kumar, Ellie Taylor, Joel Dommett and Phil Wang.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Matt Lucas returns to narrate another light-hearted retrospective poking fun at Britain's viewing habits in the 1970s. This time, he focuses on the world of comedy, unfettered as it was to the conventions of political correctness. A selection of clips from hit TV shows illustrate how, if viewers were not straight, white, middle-class men, they were at risk of being offended, and highlights examples from On the Buses, The Two Ronnies, Dave Allen at Large and The Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club. Includes commentary and contributions by Melvyn Hayes, Eric Chappell, Bill Oddie, Krishnan Guru-Murthy, Grace Dent, Nish Kumar, Ellie Taylor, Joel Dommett and Phil Wang.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Death in Paradise</title>
    <desc lang="en">Veteran rock band the Flowers of Progress are on the island to record a new album after years of being apart, and with a major sponsorship deal hanging in the balance, tensions are running high. However, their reunion proves to be short-lived when lead singer Stevie Smith is electrocuted in the swimming pool. It seems the victim had a stormy relationship with his brother and fellow band member Jim, while there are rifts between the others and more than one has an axe to grind. But how could any of them have done the deed when they were all in the studio at the time? To add to Humphrey's problems, he is still finding his feet without Camille, although the arrival of new officer JP helps lighten Dwayne's workload. Neil Morrissey and Sally Phillips guest star.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Ever since suffering a brain infection four years ago, Sunderland woman June Findlay has been unable to walk or talk and is totally dependent on her devoted husband John. Since then she has been sleeping on a hospital bed in the kitchen, with no washing or toilet facilities. Joan and John do their best, but Nick Knowles believes they deserve better, so he and his small band of builders - bolstered by an army of local tradespeople - set out to extend the Findlays' home, with designer Oliver Heath on hand to protect his vision. Can they give June back her dignity?.(n)</desc>

Joel Barish and Clementine Kruczynski were once madly in love, but their affair has gone stale. And when they meet again by chance, she doesn't just blank him, she genuinely doesn't know him. Then Joel finds out the truth. Using a new and highly experimental technology, she is having her memories of him erased from her brain. In revenge, he's determined to undergo the same process but, as dodgy scientist Dr Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) begins the procedure, Joel changes his mind. Can he hang on to enough memories to win Clementine back?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Michel Gondry's film, co-scripted with Charlie Kaufman, is a fascinating melange of romance, fantasy and illusion. Joel Barish and Clementine Kruczynski were once madly in love, but their affair has gone stale. And when they meet again by chance, she doesn't just blank him, she genuinely doesn't know him. Then Joel finds out the truth. Using a new and highly experimental technology, she is having her memories of him erased from her brain. In revenge, he's determined to undergo the same process but, as dodgy scientist Dr Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) begins the procedure, Joel changes his mind. Can he hang on to enough memories to win Clementine back?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A young bride says "until death do us part," but finds that doesn't necessarily put an end to her romance in this offbeat blend of horror, comedy, and romance. Danny (Graham Sibley) and Denise (Tracy Coogan) are a young couple who have just gotten married and head off to a beachside bungalow to celebrate their honeymoon. While enjoying a sunny afternoon on the beach, Danny and Denise's idyllic getaway takes a turn for the worse when a monster rises from the ocean and attacks Danny. The creature spews poison into Danny's mouth, and soon the new husband is dead. But Danny isn't gone for long -- he unexpectedly regains consciousness, but Denise soon learns that her new mate has become a flesh-eating zombie, and that the former vegetarian now has a taste for human beings. But Danny still has one link with the world of the living -- he loves Denise with all his heart, and struggles to keep his monstrous appetites under control for her sake, while Denise remains deeply in love with Danny, and tries to adjust to the strange and monstrous changes taking place in the man she married. Zombie Honeymoon was written and directed by Dave Gebroe, who was inspired to make the film by his sister, a horror film fan who lost her husband in a surfing accident not long after they were wed(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Ewan McGregor and Pierce Brosnan star in Roman Polanski's much lauded adaptation of author Robert Harris's political conspiracy thriller. When the corpse of the man ghost-writing the memoirs of former British Prime Minister Adam Lang is found, apparently having accidentally fallen from a ferry, another writer is quickly hired to finish the job. The new man (McGregor, in an un-named role) is dispatched to the ex-PM's swish home in the States, where he now resides. As the writer begins his task, he thinks it odd that he's not allowed access to his predecessor's draft but gets on with the work, under pressure from all sides to finish the job quickly. But, later, he uncovers documents, seemingly left by the dead man, which throw a new light on everything: they suggest Lang and his wealthy friends have very dark secrets, ones they'd possibly even kill for in order to keep them hidden. Will the new ghost-writer now suffer the same fate as the previous one?(n)</desc>

George Baker plays the eponymous Cavalier hero, fighting off the Roundhead foe as he single-handedly saves the country's aristocracy, smuggling them to safety in France. But when Charles II decides to take the trip, Cromwell's cronies are waiting in the wings. Marius Goring and John Le Mesurier (as Cromwell) beef up the supporting cast, while Sylvia Syms provides the romantic interest in a dashing yarn of love, courage and betrayal.

John Tucker (Jesse Metcalfe) is the big man on campus at his high school -- he's the captain and star player of the basketball team, he's got money, he's good-looking and charming, and he can have any girl he wants. However, the latter attribute is about to get him in serious trouble when three different girls at his school -- Heather (Ashanti), Beth (Sophia Bush) and Carrie (Arielle Kebbel) -- discover they've all been dating John at the same time. Determined to bring down the campus ladykiller, the girls devise a plan -- they pick a cute but socially clumsy girl who is new at school, Kate (Brittany Snow), and give her a crash course in stealing John's heart. Once Kate has John wrapped around her little finger, she's supposed to drop him like a bad habit and give him a taste of what heartbreak is really like. However, it seems that the early stages of the plan work a little too well, and John and Kate end up falling for each other for real. John Tucker Must Die also stars Jenny McCarthy, Penn Badgley, and Dan Payne(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Supercross</title>
    <desc lang="en">Two siblings find themselves competing on and off the racetrack in this action-packed drama. K.C. Carlyle (Steve Howey) and his kid brother, Trip (Mike Vogel), are both racers in the rough and tumble world of supercross, a revved-up variation on motocross racing in which specially modified motorcycle negotiate specially built dirt tracks that send riders through tricky twists and turns, over rough terrain, and off high-flying jumps. Both are talented racers, but K.C. has a wilder and more reckless approach, while Trip follows a more cautious path. A more profound difference between them arises when K.C. is offered a lucrative deal to ride for a factory-sponsored team; he takes the deal, and leaves his brother behind to race on his own dime. However, when an accident takes Trip out of the running on the supercross circuit, he and K.C. set aside their differences as Trip helps coach his older brother so he can succeed in his drive to the championship. Made with the cooperation of a leading supercross race promoter, Supercross: The Movie also stars Sophia Bush and Cameron Richardson as the brothers' love interests, and Robert Carradine as a determined race coach(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">The Changing of the Guard</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The Changing of the Guard. Written by Rod Serling, this nostalgic Twilight Zone episode was clearly inspired by Serling's student years at Ohio's Antioch College. Made up to look twice his age, Donald Pleasence stars as Prof. Ellis Fowler, the oldest teacher at an exclusive boy's school. Ordered by his headmaster (Liam Sullivan) to retire, Fowler is convinced that his life has been meaningless -- until he is paid a nocturnal visit by several ethereal-looking "alumni." Telecast June 1, 1962, "The Changing of the Guard" was scheduled as the final Twilight Zone of the 1961-62 season -- and at the time, it looked as if it would be the last Twilight Zone, period. Though the series would ultimately be renewed in January of 1963, it would never completely rescale the creative heights of its first three seasons(n)</desc>

After a brief flirtation with the 60-minute form, Twilight Zone wisely returned to its original half-hour format with the first episode of the series' fifth season, "In Praise of Pip." Upon learning that his beloved son Pip is dying in a field hospital in South Vietnam, two-bit bookie Max Philips (Jack Klugman) suddenly experiences an epiphany -- which earns him a bullet in the gut from a disgruntled gangster. The wounded Max stumbles into a deserted amusement park, where he is met by the younger version of his boy Pip. Expressing his undying love for his son, Max begs the Powers Above to spare the grown-up Pip's life, as the younger version begins fading into the void. Billy Mumy and Bobby Diamond share the role of the eponymous Pip. Written by Rod Serling, "In Praise of Pip" originally aired September 27, 1963(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Heartbreak Kid</title>
    <desc lang="en">(1972) Father Ted Night is rounded off by the influential American film The Heartbreak Kid , starring Charles Grodin, Jeannie Berlin and Cybill Shepherd, which both Graham Linehan and Arthur Mathews cite as a major influence on their comedy writing. Elaine May's romantic tragic-comedy stars Grodin as Lenny Cantrow, newly married to Lila (Berlin). En route to their honeymoon in Miami, he's already beginning to have second doubts after seeing her eat an egg mayo sandwich and hearing her sing the same song over again. At the resort, disaster strikes when Lila gets sunburnt and is confined to their room. Lenny, alone on the beach, suddenly spies Kelly Corcoran (Shepherd) and falls for her on the spot. Dumping Lila, he pursues Kelly to her home in Minnesota and wins her heart. But he soon learns that not everything beautiful is perfect and that people are not just commodities to be cast aside on a whim. Premiere(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Core</title>
    <desc lang="en">An unlikely band of scientists and soldiers join forces to save the world from certain destruction in this action-drama. As the world is struck with a variety of inexplicable phenomena -- attacks by enormous swarms of birds in London, the explosion of the Colosseum in Rome, a potentially deadly malfunction which forces the Space Shuttle into a Los Angeles riverbed, and the simultaneous deaths of 32 people with pacemakers in Boston -- a team of top scientific minds from around the globe is assembled to determine what has thrown the world into such a frenzy. Dr. John Keyes (Aaron Eckhart) makes the startling discovery that the Earth's electromagnetic forces have begun to collapse, thanks to a sudden lack of movement of the molten ore at the center of the Earth. If the planet is to be saved, the core of the Earth needs a jump start, and Keyes assembles a team to burrow to the center of the planet and bomb the insides back into action. Joining Keyes on this dangerous, last-chance mission are the brilliant but arrogant Conrad Zimsky (Stanley Tucci), French arms expert Dr. Serge Levesque (Tchéky Karyo, maverick researcher "Brazz" Brazzleton (Delroy Lindo), geeky computer genius Rat (DJ Qualls), and two no-nonsense military types, Commander Richard Iverson (Bruce Greenwood) and Major Rebecca Childs (Hilary Swank). However, as the crew digs deeper into the Earth, the more they discover what they haven't been told about their mission and what's really been causing the worldwide chaos. The Core was originally scheduled for release in the fall of 2002, but the movie didn't reach theaters until the spring of 2003 as special-effects experts perfected the film's more spectacular scenes(n)</desc>
