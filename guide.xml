Produced entirely over the Internet, where writers uploaded story details and actors submitted audition tapes, Perkins' 14 was released into theaters as part of the third After Dark Horror Fest. Ronald Perkins was just six years old when his parents were brutally slaughtered right before his eyes. Unable to overcome the incredible trauma of witnessing such a diabolical event, Perkins becomes convinced that the killers who murdered his parents will eventually return to finish the job they started years ago -- and he plans to be fully prepared to fight back when they do. Years later, when Perkins turns 34, he kidnaps 14 people from his hometown of Stone Cove and sets about reprogramming them to become relentless killing machines. Now, if the killers ever do return, they'll have to get through Perkins' 14 in order to reach their intended target. Trouble is, now that Perkins' 14 are ready for battle, they've become increasingly difficult to contain(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Panic Room</title>
    <desc lang="en">A well-regarded spec script by A-list screenwriter David Koepp became this stylish thriller from director David Fincher. Jodie Foster stars as Meg Altman, a single mother of an diabetic preteen daughter, Sarah (Kristen Stewart). Meg's going through an unhappy divorce that forces her and Sarah to move into a new home. They choose a deluxe New York brownstone that coincidentally boasts an unusual feature: a "panic room," a vault-like hidden space capable of literally sealing itself off from the rest of the building. With its thick steel door on springs, separate ventilation and communications systems, and video monitors linked to cameras mounted throughout the home, the room is an impregnable fortress. It quickly comes in handy when the Altmans' new residence is invaded by a trio of thieves: Junior (Jared Leto), Burnham (Forest Whitaker), and Raoul (Dwight Yoakam). Meg and Sarah are able to secure themselves in the panic room before the robbers can get to them, but it turns out that Sarah's medication is still on the outside, the phone's not yet connected, and the loot the gang's seeking is inside the panic room with them. A cat-and-mouse battle of wits ensues, with Meg trying to outwit their captors over the course of one very long night, as her daughter's health dissipates. Panic Room (2002) co-stars Ann Magnuson, Patrick Bauchau, and Koepp's fellow screenwriter, Andrew Kevin Walker, in a cameo role(n)</desc>

Documentary telling the full story of World War II with the aid of rare and unseen archive footage, recently released official documents, modern colourisation techniques, state-of-the-art satellite-delivered terrain mapping and graphics. In the run-up to September 1939, political and economic chaos in the aftermath of World War I allowed Hitler in Germany, Mussolini in Italy and ultra-nationalists in imperial Japan to seize absolute power. When Britain, France and the United States failed to confront initial acts of aggression, contempt for their weakness prompted Germany and Italy to intervene in the civil war in Spain and Hitler to make a series of land grabs which brought Europe to the brink of war.

The stakes are high because if the mystery is not solved, it might mean that physics itself needs a rethink.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Jeremy Paxman reports on Donald Trump's presidency so far, travelling across America as he attempts to make sense of his agenda - asking if it even makes sense to the man himself. The broadcaster digs into the stories behind the most controversial policies, visiting the home of North America's largest mosque to hear Arab-American experiences of the travel ban, and considers Trump's claims to be restoring America's economic fortunes amid the derelict factories of Detroit.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Score</title>
    <desc lang="en">Three generations of method acting giants unite for this crime thriller written by Kario Salem and directed by Frank Oz. Robert De Niro stars as Nick Wells, an aging thief whose specialty is safecracking and who is on the verge of retiring to a life of ease, running his jazz club and romancing his girlfriend Diane (Angela Bassett). But before he can ride off into the sunset, Nick is pressured to do one last job by his mentor and business partner, a flamboyant and extravagant upscale fence named Max (Marlon Brando). Max is plotting the heist of the Montreal Customs House, and he's got a man on the inside, Jackie Teller (Edward Norton), a talented but volatile crook who has managed to ingratiate himself with the facility's staff as a fellow employee suffering from cerebral palsy. Jackie bristles at Nick's interference in "his" score, however, and threatens violence when it seems he's going to be cut out of the action. In the meantime, Nick grows increasingly ill at ease about the operation, as it violates his two most important dictums in thievery: always work alone and never pull a job in your own city. The part of Max in The Score was written specifically for Brando by screenwriter Salem, although the improvisational star and his director Oz reportedly clashed during filming(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Dave Chappelle's Block Party</title>
    <desc lang="en">In September 2004, comedian Dave Chappelle took a break from his immensely successful Comedy Central show to stage a free, unpublicized, all-star hip-hop concert in the Clinton Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn, NY. Inviting fans over the Internet, on the street, and even in his family's hometown of Yellow Springs, OH, Chappelle asked filmmaker Michel Gondry to document the event from its inception on through to the performances themselves. The result is Dave Chappelle's Block Party, a concert film that provides not only a sampling of the music on display that September, but also an intimate look at the comedian himself. Gondry's cameras tag along with Chappelle as he visits Ohio, recruits a university marching band to play at the show, and surveys the opinions of Clinton Hill on the show that's about to take place. Along the way, we're introduced to some the comedian's favorite acts, in rehearsals and on-stage: Dead Prez, Jill Scott, Mos Def, the Roots, Erykah Badu, Kanye West, and the surprise reuniting of the Fugees(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Score</title>
    <desc lang="en">Three generations of method acting giants unite for this crime thriller written by Kario Salem and directed by Frank Oz. Robert De Niro stars as Nick Wells, an aging thief whose specialty is safecracking and who is on the verge of retiring to a life of ease, running his jazz club and romancing his girlfriend Diane (Angela Bassett). But before he can ride off into the sunset, Nick is pressured to do one last job by his mentor and business partner, a flamboyant and extravagant upscale fence named Max (Marlon Brando). Max is plotting the heist of the Montreal Customs House, and he's got a man on the inside, Jackie Teller (Edward Norton), a talented but volatile crook who has managed to ingratiate himself with the facility's staff as a fellow employee suffering from cerebral palsy. Jackie bristles at Nick's interference in "his" score, however, and threatens violence when it seems he's going to be cut out of the action. In the meantime, Nick grows increasingly ill at ease about the operation, as it violates his two most important dictums in thievery: always work alone and never pull a job in your own city. The part of Max in The Score was written specifically for Brando by screenwriter Salem, although the improvisational star and his director Oz reportedly clashed during filming(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Life</title>
    <desc lang="en">Comedians Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence team up for a story that wouldn't appear to have many immediate humorous possibilities -- two men serving life sentences in prison for a crime they did not commit. Life opens in Harlem in 1932, where Ray Gibson (Eddie Murphy) is a small-time con man in debt to Spanky, a gangster (Rick James). Ray spots would-be bank teller Claude Banks (Martin Lawrence) at a gambling spot and, figuring him for an easy mark, lifts his wallet -- only to discover Claude is broke. Ray and Claude's mutual need to raise some cash brings them together when Spanky offers them a job bringing back a load of moonshine from bootleggers in the deep south. However, things don't go well for Ray and Claude, and they're arrested by a sheriff in Mississippi who recently killed a man and needs someone on whom he can hang the charge. Since Ray and Claude are black, from out of town and have been caught red-handed with a load of illegal liquor, the sheriff figures they're easy pickings and frames them for the murder. Soon the two men are inmates in a Southern work camp, where they spend the next 55 years learning to get along with the other inmates, avoiding the wrath of the guards, seeing younger prisoners come and go and never losing hope that someday, somehow, their innocence will be proven and they'll be released. Life is the second screen pairing for Murphy and Lawrence, who also shared screen time in 1992's Boomerang, and was scripted by Robert Ramsey and Matthew Stone from an original idea by Murphy. The supporting cast includes Ned Beatty, Clarence Williams III, Bernie Mac, Nick Cassavetes and R. Lee Ermey(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Dead Woman Walking: The Karla Faye Tucker Story. This documentary, part of the American Justice series from A&amp;E, examines the Texas death penalty case of Karla Faye Walker. Narrated by American Justice host and producer Bill Kurtis, this episode goes inside the investigation of the two murders that Walker and her boyfriend Daniel Ryan Garrett committed. The trial of Walker is shown through exclusive footage. After the conviction, American Justice follows her through her daily life, showing her prison surroundings and talking with her about her crimes. Sentenced to death, while Walker was waiting to be executed, she became a born-again Christian. Her lawyers used this transformation as leverage to try to get her death sentence reduced to life in prison. Their attempts were unsuccessful and Walker was killed by lethal injection in February 1998. American Justice also shows interviews with lawyers and law enforcement professionals who knew Walker(n)</desc>

Mr Buxton has returned to live quietly in Cranford following the death of his wife, although Miss Matty is concerned about his relationship with his son as neither seem to be coping with their bereavement. The local busybody is also worried about Peggy Bell, who lives in an isolated cottage looking after her inattentive mother and domineering brother, so she hatches a plot to bring these young residents together. However, the surprise arrival of Lady Ludlow's son Lord Septimus leads to a chain of unexpected events concerning the looming railway, and a tragedy at Matty's own house forces her to re-evaluate her opinions on the subject.

    <desc lang="en">Conclusion of the two-part special. The women of Cranford are excited about the imminent visit of Lady Glenmire, until the Hon Mrs Jamieson announces that none of them is of high enough social standing to meet her - so Miss Matty leads the Amazons in snubbing both the newcomer and her hostess. But sociable Lady Glenmire is quick to offer an olive branch by hosting a memorable Halloween party, which results in the forging of new friendships. Mr Buxton is impressed by Edward Bell's ambitions, so takes him on as land agent, only for the new employee to make a disastrous decision that has dire consequences for both himself and his sister Peggy. Meanwhile, Matty is distressed when a surprising discovery about one of her close circle results in a serious falling out among the friends, and when tragedy strikes the town, she fears Cranford may never recover.

    <desc lang="en">Naturalist David Attenborough documents the universal tale that unites humanity with every other animal on the planet - the journey through life, and the goal to continue the bloodline through offspring. This edition focuses on the first hurdle any animal will face, surviving infancy. Cameras follow flightless barnacle goose chicks as they strive to find food, leaping 400ft down a cliff from the ledge where they hatched. Meanwhile, in New Zealand, young fur seals have stumbled across a safe haven in which they can learn how to avoid predators, while deep in the Gobi Desert, the long-eared jerboa learns to use its impeccable hearing to catch insect pray. Plus, albatross chicks make their first flight, as threatening tiger sharks wait patiently for them to slip up and land in the sea.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The importance of homes to animals, not only as a place to live but as a shelter from the elements and a refuge from enemies. A pack of African hunting dogs have made their home on a vast plain in Zambia, but it's far from safe as they must battle hyenas and protect their young. Hermit crabs on a tropical island settle down in empty snail shells - and when a new property washes ashore, they all form a queue, then move up the housing chain until all the shells are taken.

    <sub-title lang="en">The Journey.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">David Tennant narrates an insight into this most intriguing and comical of birds, beginning with three different species' journeys to reach their breeding grounds. Emperor penguins cross a treacherous frozen sea, and rockhoppers brave stormy seas before they come ashore and face a daunting assault up a 300ft cliff, where they are vulnerable to predators. Meanwhile, the tropical humboldts have to evade sea lions, dodge vampire bats and battle sea birds before they can lay their eggs in the desert. All the while, their every move is being secretly filmed by hidden spy technology, including robotic penguins with cameras for eyes.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In the penultimate episode of Ken Follett's epic all-star drama Caris and Mair disembark in England, but nobody notices the rats that scamper from the ship to the dock. Godwyn initially dismisses the grant, since it has no royal seal, but when Caris dares him to defy the King's order, he backs down. After witnessing so much pointless death and destruction on the French battlefields, Caris confides to Mother Cecilia (Miranda Richardson) that she no longer believes in God. Merthin (Tom Weston-Jones) returns from Italy, his family having perished in the Plague now sweeping across Europe. Reunited with Caris he urges her to elope with him, but she refuses. Despite her rejection, Merthin remains in Kingsbridge, and that night, plague-bearing rats finally cross the bridge into town. The Great Mortality sweeps through Kingsbridge, and Caris turns the convent into a makeshift hospital. When Petranilla (Cynthia Nixon) falls ill, Godwyn (Rupert Evans) is so terrified that he abandons his loyal mother, sneaking out of the priory taking most of the monks and treasure with him. Convinced she is dying, a scarred and vengeful Petranilla sends Roland (Peter Firth) a rose infected with her diseased blood. Writer: John Pielmeier (based on the novel by Ken Follett); Dir: Michael Caton-Jones; Exec Prods: Ridley Scott, Tony Scott, Rola Bauer, David W Zucker, Tim Halkin, John Weber, Jonas Bauer; Prod Cos: Tandem Communications &amp; Take 5 Prods in co-production with Galafilm and in association with Scott Free Films(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Grindhouse</title>
    <desc lang="en">Kill Bill director Quentin Tarantino and Sin City director Robert Rodriguez join forces to offer a cinematic tribute to the blood-soaked exploitation epics of yesteryear with this hyper-violent coupling of two full-length features punctuated by a collection of outrageous trailers. The first segment, directed by Rodriguez and entitled Planet Terror, details the violent struggle between a ravenous army of zombie-like humanoids who have taken control of the planet and the remaining survivors who refuse to go down without a fight. Freddy Rodriguez, Naveen Andrews, and Rose McGowan headline a cast that also includes Marley Shelton, Michael Biehn, Josh Brolin, Bruce Willis, and Tom Savini. In Death Proof -- director Tarantino's take on such peddle-to-the-metal shockers as White Line Fever -- Kurt Russell stars as an engine-revving psychopath who prefers to take out his beautiful victims at 200 mph. With a list of potential roadkill candidates that includes Rose McGowan, Jordan Ladd, Rosario Dawson, and Vanessa Ferlito, Death Proof takes viewers on an adrenaline-infused drive that's as sexy as it is shocking. Its tantalizing title borrowed from the term frequently used to describe the seedy, 1970s-era inner-city movie theaters that screened excessive, low-budget independent films containing copious amounts of violence and nudity as a means of offering counter-programming to the decidedly more restrained big-budget studio films, Grindhouse takes its love for these unabashedly sleazy efforts one step further by offering a jaw-dropping collection of fake exploitation trailers from such directors as Rob Zombie, Eli Roth, and Edgar Wright(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Gerard Butler stars in Marc Forster's violent, fact-based drama about a substance-addicted criminal who finds God and relocates to Sudan to offer his own idiosyncratic brand of Christian charity. The film initially portrays Sam Childers as being a far from nice man: a misogynistic biker whose life is steeped in crime, narcotics and violence, and who quickly returns to armed robbery almost as soon as he's released from jail. But while he was inside, his wife Lynn found Jesus, and, after Sam gets stabbed, she urges him to join her at church. Sam subsequently has his own Damascene moment and starts life afresh, founding his own (legitimate) construction company. Before long he has also built his own church. But it's only after a trip to Sudan, where he witnesses the devastation wrought by the marauding Lord's Resistance Army, that he truly becomes driven. Relocating to the African country, he sets up a faith-based centre to care for victims of the LRA's violence and rape. And also takes up arms to literally fight the good fight...

    <desc lang="en">McGee deals with his father's recent death by writing him a letter outlining the details of his latest investigation. The case involved tracking down a hactivist collective known as Krampus, who were thought to have been responsible for an incident in which the internet crashed all over Washington, DC. McGee and Abby brought in three known cyber-terrorists for questioning, and discover evidence that links the trio to an attempted breach of the Congress email server and archive. However, when this line of inquiry reaches a dead-end, the team picks up a new lead that suggests an isolated hacker from Wisconsin may be responsible. This `lone wolf' scenario does not seem plausible to McGee, though, as he recalls a lesson his late dad taught him. Crime drama, starring Sean Murray.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">John Torode and Gregg Wallace put five more keen cooks to the test in the first of two heats, and as usual they begin by serving up their Calling Card, a dish that showcases their talents. The judges' two favourites then sit it out while the others reinvent what they've just made, creating a new plate of food based on the main ingredient from the first round. After this cook-off, one of the amateurs is sent home, before the remaining four prepare dinner for a trio of former MasterChef champions, after which Friday's first two quarter-finalists will be decided.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">I Am Legend</title>
    <desc lang="en">Adapted from acclaimed author Richard Matheson's influential novelette of the same name, Constantine director Francis Lawrence's I Am Legend follows the last man on Earth as he struggles to survive while fending off the infected survivors of a devastating vampiric plague. A brilliant scientist who raced to discover a cure for the man-made virus as humanity came crumbling down all around him, Robert Neville (Will Smith) was inexplicably immune to the highly contagious superbug. Now the entire population of New York City -- and perhaps the world -- has been transformed into carnivorous bloodsuckers that fear the light and live solely to spread their contagion to any remaining living creature that crosses their path. It's been three years since civilization came to an end, and the loneliness has taken a devastating toll on Neville. By day he scours the city for food and supplies while sending out desperate radio messages in hopes that someone might respond, and by night he attempts to find a way to reverse the effects of the virus by experimenting with his own blood. But time is running out for Neville as the legions of infected watch his every move from the safety of the shadows, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. They, too, long to learn the secret that lurks in Neville's blood, though they will have to take caution while attempting to procure it because Neville will sooner die attempting to slay every last one of them than willingly giving up a single drop. Previously adapted for the screen in the 1964 Vincent Price frightener The Last Man on Earth and the 1971 Charlton Heston action film The Omega Man, Matheson's novelette also served as the inspiration for George A. Romero's groundbreaking zombie classic Night of the Living Dead(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">I Am Legend</title>
    <desc lang="en">Adapted from acclaimed author Richard Matheson's influential novelette of the same name, Constantine director Francis Lawrence's I Am Legend follows the last man on Earth as he struggles to survive while fending off the infected survivors of a devastating vampiric plague. A brilliant scientist who raced to discover a cure for the man-made virus as humanity came crumbling down all around him, Robert Neville (Will Smith) was inexplicably immune to the highly contagious superbug. Now the entire population of New York City -- and perhaps the world -- has been transformed into carnivorous bloodsuckers that fear the light and live solely to spread their contagion to any remaining living creature that crosses their path. It's been three years since civilization came to an end, and the loneliness has taken a devastating toll on Neville. By day he scours the city for food and supplies while sending out desperate radio messages in hopes that someone might respond, and by night he attempts to find a way to reverse the effects of the virus by experimenting with his own blood. But time is running out for Neville as the legions of infected watch his every move from the safety of the shadows, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. They, too, long to learn the secret that lurks in Neville's blood, though they will have to take caution while attempting to procure it because Neville will sooner die attempting to slay every last one of them than willingly giving up a single drop. Previously adapted for the screen in the 1964 Vincent Price frightener The Last Man on Earth and the 1971 Charlton Heston action film The Omega Man, Matheson's novelette also served as the inspiration for George A. Romero's groundbreaking zombie classic Night of the Living Dead(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas</title>
    <desc lang="en">He's mean, he's green, and he's doesn't like the Yuletide season one bit -- Jim Carrey stars in this live-action adaptation of the classic children's story by Dr. Seuss (aka Theodore Geisel). High atop Mt. Crumpet, the Grinch (Carrey) observes the residents of Whoville joyously preparing to celebrate Christmas. The Grinch was born in Whoville years ago, but was shunned due to his scary appearance, and his unrequited love for Martha May Whovier has turned him bitter; the good cheer of the Whos has been a thorn in his side ever since. Finally the Grinch decides he's had enough of all this happiness, and with the wary aid of his dog Max, the Grinch conspires to steal Christmas from Whoville, making off with their presents, holiday decorations, Christmas trees, and everything else used to enjoy the holiday. Molly Shannon, Christine Baranski, Jeffrey Tambor, and Clint Howard play several of the citizens of Whoville, while Anthony Hopkins narrates (taking over from the late Boris Karloff, who memorably read Dr. Seuss' story in Chuck Jones' 1966 animated adaptation of the story). Ron Howard directs(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">(1999) M Night Shyamalan's chiller about a boy who has the not-entirely-welcome ability to directly contact the dead. Bruce Willis stars as child psychologist Dr Malcolm Crowe, who is asked to help Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), who claims he can 'see dead people'. Crowe is sceptical at first, but - prompted partly by a past case he felt he badly let down - he's gradually convinced that the boy is telling the truth. Crowe believes that actively engaging with the ghostly presences could help both Sear and the spirits to find peace. Overcoming his terror, the lad finds that communicating with the deceased does, at first, seem to be beneficial. But then matters take on their own momentum, leading to one of the director's trademark plot twists... Also starring Toni Collette. M,W,S,(n)</desc>

Bruce Nolan is a television reporter working in Buffalo, NY, who has been growing increasingly dissatisfied with his existence, and after an especially bad day, he flies into a rage and curses God for making his life miserable. To Bruce's great surprise, the Supreme Being Himself appears, and tries to convince Bruce of the enormity of his task. Bruce, however, isn't buying it, so God gives him a chance to find out what he's up against; God bestows all of his powers on Bruce for a week, to see how he'd handle things. At first, Bruce has a great time bending the world around him to his will, much to the puzzlement of his girlfriend, Grace (Jennifer Aniston), but after six days God stops by to remind Bruce he hasn't done much to make the Earth a better place. Disappointed, God presents Bruce with an ultimatum -- he has one day to improve the world in a concrete way, or God will toss the planet back into the void. Bruce Almighty was directed by Tom Shadyac, who previously teamed with Jim Carrey for Liar, Liar and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective(n)</desc>

But to do so, he has to contend with his ex-wife's animosity and Kim's new step-father's wealth.

As they are being abducted, Bryan tells one of the baddies, via Kim's mobile phone: 'I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you'. He subsequently does his best to make good on his promise, using all the violent tricks of the trade his time at the CIA taught him(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Lift Off</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Lift Off. This landmark new series takes viewers back in time to see how the '80s created our modern world. The first episode of this six-part miniseries explores the revolution in personal entertainment brought on by Pac-Man, Sony Walkmans and Jane Fonda's ground-breaking workout video. Apple's Steve Wozniak helps explain how Bill Gates saw the future by selling IBM the rights to use MS-DOS software for a relatively small one-time fee, only to clean up when IBM competitors entered the market and all wanted the same software. The assassination of John Lennon heralded the end of one music era, while a bratty new kid on the block defined a new one - spelt 'MTV'. Revel in the joy of July 1981 in Britain as more than half a million people line the streets of London - and another 750 million tune-in around the globe - to see Prince Charles wed Lady Diana Spencer. And, hear from maverick businessman turned multimedia mogul Richard Branson on how he took Rock 'N Roll to new heights - literally - with the acquisition of his first 747. Sharing their first-hand stories are Darryl DMC McDaniels, Steven Tyler, Jane Fonda, Steve Wozniak, Richard Branson and Princess Diana's private secretary(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Documentary going behind the scenes of high-street bakery chain Greggs, founded in the 1930s and now trading from more than 1,670 retail outlets across the UK. Filmed over a year, the programme follows key staff members from store front to boardroom and secret tasting labs, as they prepare for big changes on the horizon. Greggs' plans to go upmarket are under way, with designer Phil introducing new interiors and the master bakers whipping up new delicacies. But retail development manager Alison is feeling the pressure. She has just two months to give 10 bakeries a makeover - will it all be worth it?.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Documentary going behind the scenes of the high-street bakery chain. The three months before Christmas are the busiest for Greggs, with Southampton shop manager Alan and head of sandwiches Paul getting into the Halloween spirit, while for the all-female branch at Gateshead it's a case of kit-off rather than bake-off as they bare all for a cheeky calendar shoot. But it isn't all fun and games as a Children in Need crisis looms when a gingerbread Pudsey Bear is found to contain dodgy E numbers, and in Stratford a suspected shoplifter tries to prove his innocence by stripping off inside the store.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The combination of romance and zombies comedy seems unfeasible... unless it falls into the hands of the brilliant Edgar Wright, co-creator with Simon Pegg (scriptwriter of Zombies Party) of the Spaced series, a milestone in recent British television. In this macabre story, Shaun (Simon Pegg) is down in the dumps, going through an unstoppable crisis in his life. About to turn 30, he passes the time in The Winchester bar, dislikes his job, argues with his mother every day, and the relationship with his girlfriend, Liz (Kate Ashfield), worsens by the hour. When she finally leaves him, Shaun decides, once and for all, to do something about his life. His first step is not visiting a psychologist, but confronting an invasion of living dead with just two weapons: a cricket bat and a shovel! Zombies Party is -at the same time- a parody and a tribute to zombie films(n)</desc>

Fifteen years ago, an elusive serial killer known as The Wolf claimed the lives of 15 young girls. Thanks to the work of Detectives Elliott Carbon (John Rhys-Davies) and Johnny Morgan ( Andrew Cymek), The Wolf was eventually captured, locked up, and placed in the care of Dr. Parker (William B. Davis). When the facility loses power and the lights go dark, however, The Wolf and the rest of the inmates seize the opportunity to reclaim their freedom. Now trapped in these winding corridors with a rampaging gang of maniacs, madmen, and murderers, Johnny and Dr. Parker must fight to survive the night, and ensure that no one escapes before order is restored(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Meskada</title>
    <desc lang="en">Class and economics muddy the investigation of a homicide in this thriller from director Josh Sternfeld. When a child is found murdered in the small town of Hilliard, police detective Noah Cordin (Nick Stahl) is assigned to investigate the case. The victim's mother, Allison Connor (Laura Benanti), is a wealthy and well-connected member of the County Board of Commissioners, so Cordin is under pressure to find the killer as soon as possible, but working with rookie officer Leslie Spencer (Rachel Nichols), he isn't finding many substantial clues. One of the few pieces of evidence suggests the culprit may have been from the nearby town of Caswell. Cordin was born and raised in Caswell and knows its history well -- while Hilliard is a prosperous suburban community, Caswell is a working-class town fallen on hard times, and its survival is dependent on a proposed factory coming into town. As Cordin spends more and more time in Caswell, he becomes a target for the resentment the locals feel toward their wealthier neighbors, and a tense situation becomes potentially explosive when word begins to circulate that Connor may use her influence to keep the new employer out of Caswell unless someone comes forward to identity who killed her son. Meskada (named for the county that contains both Hilliard and Caswell) also stars Norman Reedus, Kellan Lutz, Jonathan Tucker, and Grace Gummer(n)</desc>

The glimmer of a better life always just out of reach, Russell Baze (Christian Bale) dreams of starting a family with his girlfriend Lena (Zoe Saldana), and resolves to earn an honest living working in the same mill where his dying father did. Meanwhile, Russell's volatile younger brother Rodney (Casey Affleck) decides to serve his country by fighting in Iraq. Despite Russell's best intentions, however, his future starts to look grim when he is sent to prison following a deadly drunk-driving accident; at the same time, Rodney begins competing in illegal fights for local bar owner John Petty (Willem Dafoe), who owes a sizable debt to the very dangerous Harlan DeGroat (Woody Harrelson), a fight organizer/meth dealer who's way too into his own product. Later, after Russell is released from prison having missed his father's funeral, he is heartbroken to learn that Lena has become seriously involved with the local police chief, Wesley Barnes (Forest Whitaker). But heartache turns to anger when the desperate Rodney also gets mixed up with DeGroat, and winds up dead along with John Petty.

    <desc lang="en">The combination of romance and zombies comedy seems unfeasible... unless it falls into the hands of the brilliant Edgar Wright, co-creator with Simon Pegg (scriptwriter of Zombies Party) of the Spaced series, a milestone in recent British television. In this macabre story, Shaun (Simon Pegg) is down in the dumps, going through an unstoppable crisis in his life. About to turn 30, he passes the time in The Winchester bar, dislikes his job, argues with his mother every day, and the relationship with his girlfriend, Liz (Kate Ashfield), worsens by the hour. When she finally leaves him, Shaun decides, once and for all, to do something about his life. His first step is not visiting a psychologist, but confronting an invasion of living dead with just two weapons: a cricket bat and a shovel! Zombies Party is -at the same time- a parody and a tribute to zombie films(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Starship Troopers</title>
    <desc lang="en">Paul Verhoeven (Total Recall, Robocop) directed this science fiction action adventure, an adaptation of Robert A. Heinlein's novel. This early press release described the film's basic plot: "The heroes of the Starship Troopers story are Johnny Rico and Carmen Ibanez, high-school sweethearts who join the armed forces of the future. Separated in training, they are reunited on a crucial mission after Earth is attacked by an intelligent race of giant insects from across the galaxy. When Carmen is taken prisoner, Johnny saves her, and though the war is far from over, Johnny and Carmen will fight on together." The story focuses on a group of military grunts, trained as a fighting unit. Relaxation time includes the futuristic sport jumpball (a type of indoor football). After alien insects attack, the lives of all the Troopers are altered forever. As the war escalates, the notion of human extinction becomes a possibility. With 90% of the alien bugs computer-created, a variety of creatures are depicted-from the brain bug and the queen bug down to breeder bugs (who activate anti-aircraft plasma bugs), and armored tanker bugs. Fanged warrior bugs use their fangs and claws to dig holes, halve humans, rip off arms and legs, and slice, dice and shred their other human victims. The film employed hundreds of extras and used 400+ special fx sequences. Filmed in California (LA and Long Beach, where Cal State's pyramid gym was used for the jumpball game), New York, South Dakota, Wyoming (Casper, Hell's Half Acre), and Utah (an abandoned Wendover airstrip where the Enola Gay WWII bomber crew trained). At Mile Square Park (an abandoned airfield in Fountain Valley, California), an elaborate set was constructed to resemble a military boot camp of the future-complete with an array of pup tents, gull-winged spaceship, hurdle obstacle course, and training facility buildings. In one on-set accident, Dina Meyer had to reach in a hole and pull actor Michael Ironside out, but instead, she fell in the hole and was flown to a hospital. Licensing included toys from Galoob(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Fight Club</title>
    <desc lang="en">In this darkly comic drama, Edward Norton stars as a depressed young man (named in the credits only as "Narrator") who has become a small cog in the world of big business. He doesn't like his work and gets no sense of reward from it, attempting instead to drown his sorrows by putting together the "perfect" apartment. He can't sleep and feels alienated from the world at large; he's become so desperate to relate to others that he's taken to visiting support groups for patients with terminal diseases so that he'll have people to talk to. One day on a business flight, he discovers Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a charming iconoclast who sells soap. Tyler doesn't put much stock in the materialistic world, and he believes that one can learn a great deal through pain, misfortune, and chaos. Tyler cheerfully challenges his new friend to a fight. Our Narrator finds that bare-knuckle brawling makes him feel more alive than he has in years, and soon the two become friends and roommates, meeting informally to fight once a week. As more men join in, the "fight club" becomes an underground sensation, even though it's a closely guarded secret among the participants. (First rule: Don't talk about fight club. Second rule: Don't talk about fight club.) But as our Narrator and Tyler bond through violence, a strange situation becomes more complicated when Tyler becomes involved with Marla (Helena Bonham Carter), whom our Narrator became infatuated with when they were both crashing the support-group circuit. Based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club was directed by David Fincher, who previously directed Pitt in the thriller Seven(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Avengers: Age of Ultron</title>
    <desc lang="en">This sequel to the smash-hit comic-book epic The Avengers finds the iconic superhero team dealing with a threat of their own making: a sentient robot called Ultron (voice of James Spader), who was originally designed as part of a peacekeeping program. Since the events of the last film, Captain America (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) have been working to take down various cells of a secret society of villains known as HYDRA. Their zeal to make the world a better, safer place inspires Tony Stark, genius billionaire and alter ego of Iron Man, to create Ultron in order to respond to additional threats that the Avengers aren't able to handle. Ultron, unfortunately, takes this directive way too seriously -- he believes that world peace can only be achieved by exterminating humanity, and he'll stop at nothing to accomplish this goal. The battle between the Avengers and Ultron is further complicated by the appearance of superpowered siblings Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), who ally themselves with the homicidal android. Samuel L. Jackson and Cobie Smulders co-star as, respectively, S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives Nick Fury and Maria Hill. Joss Whedon, writer and director of the previous Avengers movie, returns in both capacities here(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Starship Troopers</title>
    <desc lang="en">Paul Verhoeven (Total Recall, Robocop) directed this science fiction action adventure, an adaptation of Robert A. Heinlein's novel. This early press release described the film's basic plot: "The heroes of the Starship Troopers story are Johnny Rico and Carmen Ibanez, high-school sweethearts who join the armed forces of the future. Separated in training, they are reunited on a crucial mission after Earth is attacked by an intelligent race of giant insects from across the galaxy. When Carmen is taken prisoner, Johnny saves her, and though the war is far from over, Johnny and Carmen will fight on together." The story focuses on a group of military grunts, trained as a fighting unit. Relaxation time includes the futuristic sport jumpball (a type of indoor football). After alien insects attack, the lives of all the Troopers are altered forever. As the war escalates, the notion of human extinction becomes a possibility. With 90% of the alien bugs computer-created, a variety of creatures are depicted-from the brain bug and the queen bug down to breeder bugs (who activate anti-aircraft plasma bugs), and armored tanker bugs. Fanged warrior bugs use their fangs and claws to dig holes, halve humans, rip off arms and legs, and slice, dice and shred their other human victims. The film employed hundreds of extras and used 400+ special fx sequences. Filmed in California (LA and Long Beach, where Cal State's pyramid gym was used for the jumpball game), New York, South Dakota, Wyoming (Casper, Hell's Half Acre), and Utah (an abandoned Wendover airstrip where the Enola Gay WWII bomber crew trained). At Mile Square Park (an abandoned airfield in Fountain Valley, California), an elaborate set was constructed to resemble a military boot camp of the future-complete with an array of pup tents, gull-winged spaceship, hurdle obstacle course, and training facility buildings. In one on-set accident, Dina Meyer had to reach in a hole and pull actor Michael Ironside out, but instead, she fell in the hole and was flown to a hospital. Licensing included toys from Galoob(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Fight Club</title>
    <desc lang="en">In this darkly comic drama, Edward Norton stars as a depressed young man (named in the credits only as "Narrator") who has become a small cog in the world of big business. He doesn't like his work and gets no sense of reward from it, attempting instead to drown his sorrows by putting together the "perfect" apartment. He can't sleep and feels alienated from the world at large; he's become so desperate to relate to others that he's taken to visiting support groups for patients with terminal diseases so that he'll have people to talk to. One day on a business flight, he discovers Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a charming iconoclast who sells soap. Tyler doesn't put much stock in the materialistic world, and he believes that one can learn a great deal through pain, misfortune, and chaos. Tyler cheerfully challenges his new friend to a fight. Our Narrator finds that bare-knuckle brawling makes him feel more alive than he has in years, and soon the two become friends and roommates, meeting informally to fight once a week. As more men join in, the "fight club" becomes an underground sensation, even though it's a closely guarded secret among the participants. (First rule: Don't talk about fight club. Second rule: Don't talk about fight club.) But as our Narrator and Tyler bond through violence, a strange situation becomes more complicated when Tyler becomes involved with Marla (Helena Bonham Carter), whom our Narrator became infatuated with when they were both crashing the support-group circuit. Based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club was directed by David Fincher, who previously directed Pitt in the thriller Seven(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Avengers: Age of Ultron</title>
    <desc lang="en">This sequel to the smash-hit comic-book epic The Avengers finds the iconic superhero team dealing with a threat of their own making: a sentient robot called Ultron (voice of James Spader), who was originally designed as part of a peacekeeping program. Since the events of the last film, Captain America (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) have been working to take down various cells of a secret society of villains known as HYDRA. Their zeal to make the world a better, safer place inspires Tony Stark, genius billionaire and alter ego of Iron Man, to create Ultron in order to respond to additional threats that the Avengers aren't able to handle. Ultron, unfortunately, takes this directive way too seriously -- he believes that world peace can only be achieved by exterminating humanity, and he'll stop at nothing to accomplish this goal. The battle between the Avengers and Ultron is further complicated by the appearance of superpowered siblings Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), who ally themselves with the homicidal android. Samuel L. Jackson and Cobie Smulders co-star as, respectively, S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives Nick Fury and Maria Hill. Joss Whedon, writer and director of the previous Avengers movie, returns in both capacities here(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Great White Hype</title>
    <desc lang="en">Boxing is more than just a sport -- it's also a business and a con game in this satirical comedy. Rev. Fred Sultan (Samuel L. Jackson) is a shrewd boxing promoter and manager whose meal ticket is heavyweight champion James "The Grim Reaper" Roper (Damon Wayans), a fighter whose skill and confidence significantly outstrips his intelligence. While the top-ranked contender for Roper's title is Marvin Shabazz (Michael Jace), Sultan isn't too keen on the idea of Shabazz fighting Roper -- it seems that both fighters are black, and Sultan's figures show that mixed race matches stir up a lot more media attention and pay-per-view customers. Eager to find a white challenger for Roper, Sultan digs up Terry Conklin (Peter Berg), who won a Golden Gloves fight against Roper many years ago but is now out of the game and fronting a rock band called Massive Head Wound. Thanks to a few bribes and a couple of fixed fights, Sultan is able to arrange for Conklin to be next in line to battle "The Grim Reaper." However, Conklin is taking his renewed career as a boxer quite seriously, while Roper, convinced that Conklin doesn't stand a chance, has let himself go and gained a lot of weight. Suddenly Sultan realizes that Roper might just lose the piece-of-cake fight he's so carefully arranged, while journalist Mitchell Kane (Jeff Goldblum) smells a rat in Conklin's sudden rise to ranking status. Jon Lovitz, Cheech Marin, and Corbin Bernsen highlight the supporting cast, while members of the well-regarded alternative rock band Local H appear as Massive Head Wound(n)</desc>

After this untimely breakup, Jane begins to develop a thesis that male behavior is directly related to that of wildlife, with similar patterns existing in both. She studies the tendency for animals to be noncommittal and compares men to bulls, dogs, and other creatures. To prove her theories, she enlists the help of her roommate Eddie (Hugh Jackman), a womanizer who falls into all of the patterns of her research. When applying her studies to Eddie, she gains exposure and suddenly becomes a sensation as a pseudonymous sex columnist. This is the second directorial effort from actor Tony Goldwyn, after his 1999 feature A Walk on the Moon(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back</title>
    <desc lang="en">The frequently recurring title characters, employed by writer and director Kevin Smith as supporting players in several of his films, are put to rest with this comedy that focuses on them exclusively. Jay (Jason Mews) and Silent Bob (Smith) are a pair of stoned New Jersey slackers who have long been used as the templates for a pair of popular comic book heroes, Bluntman and Chronic. When they learn that their alter egos are to be turned into a major motion picture without their consent or compensation, the pair sets off for Hollywood to sabotage the production. Along the way, they encounter an ape, a nun (Carrie Fisher), the cast of Scooby-Doo, a Charlie's Angels-style band of sexy women who use them as stool pigeons in a diamond heist, and an unhinged wildlife ranger (Will Ferrell). They also meet up with some regulars from the Smith canon, including Alyssa Jones (Joey Lauren Adams), Brian O'Halloran as Dante Hicks, Jason Lee as Banky Edwards, Alanis Morissette as God, and actors Ben Affleck and Matt Damon in dual roles as themselves and two other familiar characters.

    <title lang="en">Ponyo</title>
    <desc lang="en">Acclaimed anime master Hayao Miyazaki returns for his ninth animated feature with Ponyo, which deals with a friendship between a five-year-old boy and a goldfish princess who yearns to be human. The daughter of the king of the ocean, Ponyo is no ordinary goldfish -- she has all the magic of the sea at her disposal. But when five-year-old Sosuke befriends the spunky little fish near the seaside home he shares with his mother and father, a special connection sparks between the two children, and Ponyo becomes determined to become human. Transforming into a little girl, Ponyo shows up at Sosuke's doorstep, delighted to make herself at home with her new land-dwelling family. But having a magical fish princess walking around on dry land begins setting the mystical balance of the world off kilter, and even though the innocent love Ponyo feels for her dear friend is strong, it will take some help from the greatest powers in the ocean to make things right again(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Haute Tension and Hills Have Eyes director Alexandre Aja pays homage to the films that made him fall in love with the horror genre by helming this comedic remake of director Joe Dante's 1978 Jaws parody. Lake Victoria may look peaceful, but beneath the placid waters of this painterly lake lurks a deadly menace. A powerful underwater tremor has released scores of man-eating prehistoric fish into the waters, and now it's up to a group of unlikely heroes to band together and defeat the razor-toothed predators. With time running out and the aquatic carnivores taking over, one brave heroine (Elisabeth Shue) will risk everything to save the lake and prevent her family from becoming fish food. Richard Dreyfuss, Ving Rhames, Jerry O'Connell, and Adam Scott star in the Dimension Films production(n)</desc>

Martin Balsam stars as Martin Senescu, curator of a "chamber of horrors" wax museum. Upon learning that the museum is to be demolished, Martin takes his favorite wax statues -- those of Jack the Ripper, Henri "Bluebeard" Landru, and ax murderer Albert W. Hicks -- to his home, much to the dismay of his wife Emma (Maggie Mahoney). Not long afterward, two brutal murders take place -- and the evidence leads Martin to conclude that the culprits were his beloved wax figures. Though credited to Charles Beaumont, "The New Exhibit" was actually scripted by longtime Beaumont collaborator Jerry Sohl(n)</desc>
