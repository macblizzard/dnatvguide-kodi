    <title lang="en">The Conjuring</title>
    <desc lang="en">A demonic entity lays claim to family living in a secluded farmhouse, prompting them to seek the aid of two renowned paranormal researchers in this tale of possession inspired by actual events. The story gets underway as paranormal researchers Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) evaluate a mysterious doll discovered by a trio of young roommates in 1968. Believing their house to be haunted by the wayward spirit of a deceased young girl, they give the girl permission to inhabit the doll, and soon their lives become a waking nightmare. Informed by Ed and Lorraine that they have fallen victim to an inhuman spirit (aka a demon) seeking a human host, the roommates entrust the doll to the Warrens, who place it in their personal museum for safekeeping. Flash forward three years to Harrisville, RI, where the Perron family have just moved into their country dream home -- an 18th century farmhouse that offers plenty of space for parents Carolyn (Lili Taylor) and Roger (Ron Livingston), as well as their five daughters Andrea (Shanley Caswell), Nancy (Hayley McFarland), Christine (Joey King), Cindy (Mackenzie Foy), and April (Kyla Deaver). It seems like the ideal place to raise a family until a series of unsettling events leave the Perron family convinced they are not alone.

    <title lang="en">Music for Misfits: The Story of Indie</title>
    <sub-title lang="en">Into the Mainstream.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The 1990s saw the original independent labels struggle in the wake of acid house, allowing the major labels to move in with Britpop, spearheaded by Blur and Oasis. Bands with an old indie ethos switched to the majors, which though conservative in nature were commercially astute. By the mid-point of the decade, the spirit of the DIY boom had all but gone. However, a recent renaissance has seen the return of some independent labels, who seem to have learned from the mistakes of the past. Narrated by Mark Radcliffe. Last in the series.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Reporter Sophie Morgan travels to the Samoan Islands in the heart of the Pacific Ocean to investigate an epidemic of obesity in the region. Statistics reveal that American Samoa has the highest rates of obesity in the world - up to 93 per cent of people are overweight or obese, and one in three has diabetes.

Set in New York City, the film focuses on five different characters with radically different perspectives on life. Gene (Alan Arkin) manages a large insurance company and is a compulsive pessimist, constantly bursting the bubbles of his more cheery colleagues. Walker (John Turturro), who holds a similarly bleak view of the world, decides that he cannot stand another day in his dull life as a physics professor and thus promptly dumps his wife, Patricia (Amy Irving). Troy (Matthew McConaughey) is an up-and-coming lawyer whose career is derailed after a hit-and-run accident. And Beatrice (Clea DuVall) is a modest cleaning woman hoping for a miracle.

    <title lang="en">Trade</title>
    <desc lang="en">After his 13-year-old sister is abducted by sex traffickers, a determined Mexican teen travels from the barrios of Mexico City to a run-down stash house in New Jersey in a desperate attempt to rescue the frightened girl before she is swallowed whole by one of the criminal underworld's darkest secrets. Jorge's (Cesar Ramos) adolescent sister, Adriana (Paulina Gaitan), has been kidnapped and thrust into a lucrative underground trade in which young girls are bought and sold to the highest bidder. Now, as the terrified youngster is herded through a complex network of underground tunnels leading into the United States, her only ally is a Polish woman named Veronica (Alicja Bachleda), who has been tricked into the trade by the same nefarious gang. After circumventing immigration officers and eventually working his way across the border, the desperate Jorge comes into contact with a Texas lawman named Ray (Kevin Kline), whose own devastating personal loss to sex traffickers causes him to join the search for Adriana. In the dark days that follow, Jorge and Ray form a close bond as they witness the horrors of a secret Internet sex slave auction and discover just how far the depths of human depravity can plunge while attempting to maintain hope that brother and sister will one day be reunited. In the world of international sex trafficking, however, innocent victims disappear without a trace every day and few who fall prey to these reprehensible predators are ever seen again(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Crew</title>
    <desc lang="en">In this dark comedy, a group of retirees wants to save their homes -- but they're not typical senior citizens trying to make the most of their Social Security checks. Four aging former mobsters -- Joey "Bats" Pistella (Burt Reynolds), Bobby Bartellemeo (Richard Dreyfuss), Mike the Brick (Dan Hedaya), and Tony "The Mouth" Donato (Seymour Cassel) -- live in the same rundown Miami apartment complex, the Raj Mahal. New owners hope to clear out the current tenants and replace them with a younger, more lucrative clientele. But the veteran gangsters don't want to move, so to scrape up the extra rent money, they take a job executing the father of a Miami mob boss. They happen to know he's already dead, so all they have to do is make it look like they did the hit. Their problems start when loudmouthed ladies' man Tony tells too much to Ferris (Jennifer Tilly), a stripper, and soon she's talked him into murdering her mother (Lainie Kazan) in exchange for her silence. The Crew also features Carrie-Anne Moss as a detective and Jeremy Piven as a mob kingpin out to avenge his father's death(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Thirteen Conversations About One Thing</title>
    <desc lang="en">Following up on her acclaimed debut, Clockwatchers, Jill Sprecher spins this intricate ensemble film about life's big questions. Set in New York City, the film focuses on five different characters with radically different perspectives on life. Gene (Alan Arkin) manages a large insurance company and is a compulsive pessimist, constantly bursting the bubbles of his more cheery colleagues. Walker (John Turturro), who holds a similarly bleak view of the world, decides that he cannot stand another day in his dull life as a physics professor and thus promptly dumps his wife, Patricia (Amy Irving). Troy (Matthew McConaughey) is an up-and-coming lawyer whose career is derailed after a hit-and-run accident. And Beatrice (Clea DuVall) is a modest cleaning woman hoping for a miracle. This film was screened at the 2001 Toronto Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Trade</title>
    <desc lang="en">After his 13-year-old sister is abducted by sex traffickers, a determined Mexican teen travels from the barrios of Mexico City to a run-down stash house in New Jersey in a desperate attempt to rescue the frightened girl before she is swallowed whole by one of the criminal underworld's darkest secrets. Jorge's (Cesar Ramos) adolescent sister, Adriana (Paulina Gaitan), has been kidnapped and thrust into a lucrative underground trade in which young girls are bought and sold to the highest bidder. Now, as the terrified youngster is herded through a complex network of underground tunnels leading into the United States, her only ally is a Polish woman named Veronica (Alicja Bachleda), who has been tricked into the trade by the same nefarious gang. After circumventing immigration officers and eventually working his way across the border, the desperate Jorge comes into contact with a Texas lawman named Ray (Kevin Kline), whose own devastating personal loss to sex traffickers causes him to join the search for Adriana. In the dark days that follow, Jorge and Ray form a close bond as they witness the horrors of a secret Internet sex slave auction and discover just how far the depths of human depravity can plunge while attempting to maintain hope that brother and sister will one day be reunited. In the world of international sex trafficking, however, innocent victims disappear without a trace every day and few who fall prey to these reprehensible predators are ever seen again(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Crew</title>
    <desc lang="en">In this dark comedy, a group of retirees wants to save their homes -- but they're not typical senior citizens trying to make the most of their Social Security checks. Four aging former mobsters -- Joey "Bats" Pistella (Burt Reynolds), Bobby Bartellemeo (Richard Dreyfuss), Mike the Brick (Dan Hedaya), and Tony "The Mouth" Donato (Seymour Cassel) -- live in the same rundown Miami apartment complex, the Raj Mahal. New owners hope to clear out the current tenants and replace them with a younger, more lucrative clientele. But the veteran gangsters don't want to move, so to scrape up the extra rent money, they take a job executing the father of a Miami mob boss. They happen to know he's already dead, so all they have to do is make it look like they did the hit. Their problems start when loudmouthed ladies' man Tony tells too much to Ferris (Jennifer Tilly), a stripper, and soon she's talked him into murdering her mother (Lainie Kazan) in exchange for her silence. The Crew also features Carrie-Anne Moss as a detective and Jeremy Piven as a mob kingpin out to avenge his father's death(n)</desc>

Lee and Lucy have enjoyed a spot of culture at their local cinema, but the sparkle of a French movie is soon diminished when the romantic walk home finds them in an imposing underpass. She has her handbag stolen by a bunch of cocky youths from under his nose. Given the fact the layabout failed to protect her, or come up with an accurate description of their muggers, Lee feels the urge to prove his manliness, but will a spell at the local boxing ring be a help or a hindrance? Sally Bretton and Katy Wix also star.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Mike Myers stars as Austin Powers, by day a hipster fashion photographer in mid-1960s swinging London and by night a crime-fighting secret agent. Austin's wardrobe is most outrageous, his vocabulary is crowded by the cool slang of the day (Groovy, baby!), and he's irresistible to women, despite the fact that he can be charitably described as "stocky" and has teeth that strike fear into any practicing dentist. When his nemesis, the arch-enemy Dr. Evil (also played by Myers), has himself cryogenically frozen and sent into space, Powers also has himself put on ice so he can be thawed out when Dr. Evil returns. In 1997, Dr. Evil returns to Earth and is back to his old tricks, so Austin is thawed out and returned to active service - though he soon discovers his style doesn't play so well 30 years on!(n)</desc>

Set in the aftermath of a civil war in Medieval England, Queen Isabella defeats and imprisons her husband, making way for their young son, Edward III, to be crowned King. Meanwhile, in the town of Kingsbridge, an injured mysterious knight is helped to shelter by the teenage sons of Sir Gerald, Earl of Shiring Merthin and Ralph. As healers Mattie and Caris, along with Mother Cecilia and Prior Anthony, nurse him back to health, rumours spread that the King has been murdered and his killer has disappeared. The end of the war does not mean peace for the people of Kingsbridge though, as the arrival of the corrupt Queen's right-hand man, Sir Roland, leads to the punishment of supposed 'traitors' in the town. Caris and her aunt, Petranilla try to use their charms to secure the freedom of Caris' father Edmund, but Petranilla has her own motives and will go to any lengths to achieve her ambitions for her son, Godwyn(n)</desc>

The case involved tracking down a hactivist collective known as Krampus, who were thought to have been responsible for an incident in which the internet crashed all over Washington, DC. McGee and Abby brought in three known cyber-terrorists for questioning, and discover evidence that links the trio to an attempted breach of the Congress email server and archive. However, when this line of inquiry reaches a dead-end, the team picks up a new lead that suggests an isolated hacker from Wisconsin may be responsible. This `lone wolf' scenario does not seem plausible to McGee, though, as he recalls a lesson his late dad taught him. Crime drama, starring Sean Murray.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood assess the 11 remaining contestants' dessert-making skills, beginning with a signature trifle combining biscuit, cake, jelly or custard in distinct layers. The technical challenge involves creating floating islands of meringues on creme anglaise, and the contenders must prepare 24 petits fours for the showstopper. Plus, presenter Mel Giedroyc explores the origins of the trifle and discovers how it was transformed in the Georgian era from an elitist treat for the aristocracy to a dish that was accessible to the masses.(n)</desc>

Two of them are then eliminated and the three remaining hopefuls work a busy lunchtime service at London's Bistro 51, before heading back to the MasterChef kitchen to cook two final courses, hoping to win a place in Friday's quarter-final.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Slumdog Millionaire</title>
    <desc lang="en">(2008) Part of More4's Indian week, Danny Boyle's eight Oscar- and seven BAFTA-winning blockbuster opens as Jamal Malik (Dev Patel), a chaiwalah at a call centre, is on the verge of winning 20 million rupees on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? . But the host of the show, Prem Kumar (Anil Kapoor) is convinced he's cheating and hands him over to the police to beat the truth out of him. Jamal reveals that the right answer to each question has come from a significant part of his life, from when he and his brother Salim were orphaned after their mother was killed in religious violence. As he continues his story, Jamal reveals how he knows each answer; how he fell in love with Latika, an orphaned girl from whom he was later separated; and how his brother Salim took the path of violence as a gangster's gunman. But as Jamal is returned to the studio for the last question, Salim finally repays his brother's trust. As well as the outstanding Patel, Jamal is played in different stages of his life by Tanay Hemant Gharu and Ayush Mahesh Khedekar; Salim is played by Madhur Mittal, Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala and Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail; Latika is played by Frieda Pinto, Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar and Rubina Ali, all of whom turn in stunning performances.

    <title lang="en">Drumline</title>
    <desc lang="en">After decades of movies about college sports, the bands who take the field at halftime finally get their day in the sun in this musical comedy drama. Devon Miles (Nick Cannon) is a talented young percussionist from Harlem who wins a music scholarship to Atlanta A &amp; T, a prestigious African-American university. For years, Atlanta A &amp; T has won awards for their show-style marching band, who combine expert musicianship (incorporating funk, R&amp;B, and jazz rhythms into the traditional marching band repertoire) with choreography, dancing cheerleaders, and roof-raising showmanship. Dr. Aaron Lee (Orlando Jones), the school's band director, gives Devon a spot in the marching band's drumline, the heart and soul of a show-style band, but discovers Devon's previous musical education hardly meets his usual standard when he learns that his new drummer can't read music. Devon soon earns a reputation as a stubborn individualist within the band, not necessarily a good thing in an ensemble where a strictly unified performance is considers the ideal. Devon's cocksure attitude and streetwise style doesn't mesh very comfortably with Sean Taylor (Leonard Roberts), a disciplined senior who resents the presence of the upstart freshman in the drumline, and things become even less harmonious when Devon begins making a play for Laila (Zoe Saldana), a beautiful girl who is also being courted by Sean. Songwriter and record producer Dallas Austin, who has worked with Boyz II Men, TLC, and Pink, served as executive producer for Drumline, helped produce the film's musical score, and contributed his own experiences as a marching band member to the screenplay(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">(2008) Part of More4's Indian week, Danny Boyle's eight Oscar- and seven BAFTA-winning blockbuster opens as Jamal Malik (Dev Patel), a chaiwalah at a call centre, is on the verge of winning 20 million rupees on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? . But the host of the show, Prem Kumar (Anil Kapoor) is convinced he's cheating and hands him over to the police to beat the truth out of him. Jamal reveals that the right answer to each question has come from a significant part of his life, from when he and his brother Salim were orphaned after their mother was killed in religious violence. As he continues his story, Jamal reveals how he knows each answer; how he fell in love with Latika, an orphaned girl from whom he was later separated; and how his brother Salim took the path of violence as a gangster's gunman. But as Jamal is returned to the studio for the last question, Salim finally repays his brother's trust. As well as the outstanding Patel, Jamal is played in different stages of his life by Tanay Hemant Gharu and Ayush Mahesh Khedekar; Salim is played by Madhur Mittal, Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala and Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail; Latika is played by Frieda Pinto, Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar and Rubina Ali, all of whom turn in stunning performances.

    <title lang="en">Drumline</title>
    <desc lang="en">After decades of movies about college sports, the bands who take the field at halftime finally get their day in the sun in this musical comedy drama. Devon Miles (Nick Cannon) is a talented young percussionist from Harlem who wins a music scholarship to Atlanta A &amp; T, a prestigious African-American university. For years, Atlanta A &amp; T has won awards for their show-style marching band, who combine expert musicianship (incorporating funk, R&amp;B, and jazz rhythms into the traditional marching band repertoire) with choreography, dancing cheerleaders, and roof-raising showmanship. Dr. Aaron Lee (Orlando Jones), the school's band director, gives Devon a spot in the marching band's drumline, the heart and soul of a show-style band, but discovers Devon's previous musical education hardly meets his usual standard when he learns that his new drummer can't read music. Devon soon earns a reputation as a stubborn individualist within the band, not necessarily a good thing in an ensemble where a strictly unified performance is considers the ideal. Devon's cocksure attitude and streetwise style doesn't mesh very comfortably with Sean Taylor (Leonard Roberts), a disciplined senior who resents the presence of the upstart freshman in the drumline, and things become even less harmonious when Devon begins making a play for Laila (Zoe Saldana), a beautiful girl who is also being courted by Sean. Songwriter and record producer Dallas Austin, who has worked with Boyz II Men, TLC, and Pink, served as executive producer for Drumline, helped produce the film's musical score, and contributed his own experiences as a marching band member to the screenplay(n)</desc>

Bruce Willis stars as child psychologist Dr Malcolm Crowe, who is asked to help Cole Sear, who claims he can 'see dead people'. Crowe is sceptical at first, but he's gradually convinced that the boy is telling the truth. Crowe believes that actively engaging with the ghostly presences could help both Sear and the spirits to find peace. Overcoming his terror, the lad finds that communicating with the deceased does, at first, seem to be beneficial. But then matters take on their own momentum, leading to one of the director's trademark plot twists..(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Heartbreakers</title>
    <desc lang="en">After the little white lies of Romy and Michele's High School Reunion (1997), director David Mirkin focuses on scheming of a different sort in Heartbreakers. Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt play Max and Page Conners, a mother and daughter who share everything with each other: relationship advice, hair and makeup hints, and the money they win in costly divorce settlements with rich men. When the film opens, the Conners are putting the finishing touches on conning Dean (Ray Liotta), an auto-body shop owner. When the dust from that scam clears, Page announces she's ready to move away from her mother and set up shop on her own -- but in order to clear an outstanding debt, Max insists they bankrupt one more bachelor together. They settle upon phlegmatic Palm Springs widower William B. Tensy (Gene Hackman), a chain smoker with a heart of gold and a similarly bountiful bank account. Only two things stand in their way: Tensy's Teutonic caretaker Miss Madress (Nora Dunn) and beachfront bartender Jack (Jason Lee), a wry stargazer with whom Page becomes unexpectedly smitten. Heartbreakers is the third collaboration from writers Steven Mazur and Paul Guy, whose previous screwball comedy was 1997's international hit, Liar Liar(n)</desc>

The terrified citizens of Haven, LA, have been beset by swarms of locusts and watched as rivers turned to blood. As if that wasn't enough to put the fear of God into any Bible-reading Christian, ominous rumors of a local swamp cult have left many of the small-town citizens turning to prayer for fear that the end is finally nigh. Enter Katherine Winter (Hilary Swank), a skeptical myth-buster and renowned theology scholar with a special knack for spotting religious trickery. Though at first exceedingly confident that she will uncover a human component behind the otherworldly occurrences, Katherine quickly learns that just because one doesn't believe in the supernatural doesn't necessarily mean that it doesn't exist(n)</desc>

On the way to Paris with his high-school French club, Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) has a vivid premonition of the plane crashing and killing all its passengers. After Alex and some other passengers demand to be let off the flight, his premonition turns out to be true, and the jet explodes during takeoff. While the FBI is convinced that Alex was involved in some kind of foul play, the passengers who got off the flight are all dying in horrible ways, as if whoever determined that the passengers would perish is punishing those who cheated death. Final Destination marked the feature directorial debut of James Wong, a producer and director for the TV series The X Files(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In this teenage horror film, a young man avoids the hand of death, only to find that he can't get away from it so easily. On the way to Paris with his high-school French club, Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) has a vivid premonition of the plane crashing and killing all its passengers. After Alex and some other passengers demand to be let off the flight, his premonition turns out to be true, and the jet explodes during takeoff. While the FBI is convinced that Alex was involved in some kind of foul play, the passengers who got off the flight are all dying in horrible ways, as if whoever determined that the passengers would perish is punishing those who cheated death. Final Destination marked the feature directorial debut of James Wong, a producer and director for the TV series The X Files(n)</desc>

Built between 1754 and 1759 by the 5th Earl of Dumfries, and with a unique collection of Chippendale furniture, the house has been described as an 18th-century time capsule, as the principal rooms and their contents have remained unchanged for over 250 years. In June 2007, the Prince of Wales headed a consortium of charities and heritage bodies to purchase this unique house, its contents and adjoining land. This is the story of his efforts to keep this historical jewel intact and accessible to the public.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Kevin McCloud revisits a memorable restoration project in the remote Creuse region of central France. Back in 2003, when Denise Daniel and Doug Ibbs gave up everything in the UK to start a new life abroad, they couldn't have known what was ahead of them. Falling in love with a dilapidated manor house with just four crumbling walls and half a roof, they embarked on a mission to transform it - working day and night, doing everything themselves, year after year - until slowly but surely they created a magnificent edifice out of the ruins they bought off the internet. On the 70th anniversary of the destruction of the original 19th-century building by the German army, the house finally took its finished form.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Thirty-seven-year-old Robert arrives at St George's Hospital, London after colliding with a car on his motorbike. Scans show he has a bleed on the brain, a broken jaw, and two missing teeth, and he faces potentially life-changing injuries and extensive surgery. Meanwhile, 54-year-old Mary collapsed in the street on the way to work and hit her head. Doctors need to establish whether it is simple fainting, or whether something more sinister is to blame, with tests revealing she will need a pacemaker fitted. Plus, 27-year-old Jessica comes to A&amp;E with a wound that will not heal, after having a lumpectomy to remove breast cancer tissue two months ago.(n)</desc>

A likeable young man despite his depressive disposition, Zia (Patrick Fugit) puts blade to wrist only to find that the pain of life doesn't end with the coming of death. Now trapped in a bleak metaphysical landscape populated entirely by suicide victims blearily searching for the joys that eluded them in the physical realm, Zia soon learns that the love is one of the latest arrivals in the dreary land of the dead. As Zia sets out to locate his ill-fated former companion and experience the joys that eluded the couple in life, he is joined in his quest by a lovelorn Russian rocker named Eugene (Shea Wigham) and an accidental tourist named Mikal (Shannyn Sossamon), who's looking for a way out of the sorrowful stir(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Meskada</title>
    <desc lang="en">Class and economics muddy the investigation of a homicide in this thriller from director Josh Sternfeld. When a child is found murdered in the small town of Hilliard, police detective Noah Cordin (Nick Stahl) is assigned to investigate the case. The victim's mother, Allison Connor (Laura Benanti), is a wealthy and well-connected member of the County Board of Commissioners, so Cordin is under pressure to find the killer as soon as possible, but working with rookie officer Leslie Spencer (Rachel Nichols), he isn't finding many substantial clues. One of the few pieces of evidence suggests the culprit may have been from the nearby town of Caswell. Cordin was born and raised in Caswell and knows its history well -- while Hilliard is a prosperous suburban community, Caswell is a working-class town fallen on hard times, and its survival is dependent on a proposed factory coming into town. As Cordin spends more and more time in Caswell, he becomes a target for the resentment the locals feel toward their wealthier neighbors, and a tense situation becomes potentially explosive when word begins to circulate that Connor may use her influence to keep the new employer out of Caswell unless someone comes forward to identity who killed her son.

Fifteen years ago, an elusive serial killer known as The Wolf claimed the lives of 15 young girls. Thanks to the work of Detectives Elliott Carbon (John Rhys-Davies) and Johnny Morgan ( Andrew Cymek), The Wolf was eventually captured, locked up, and placed in the care of Dr. Parker (William B. Davis). When the facility loses power and the lights go dark, however, The Wolf and the rest of the inmates seize the opportunity to reclaim their freedom. Now trapped in these winding corridors with a rampaging gang of maniacs, madmen, and murderers, Johnny and Dr. Parker must fight to survive the night, and ensure that no one escapes before order is restored(n)</desc>

However, before he can do so, his boss Jimmy Price asks him to track down the missing daughter of another gangster, Eddie Temple, and as Temple's of an even nastier temperament than Price it's not a request he can easily refuse. And once he embarks on his task, complications begin to stack upon each other in much the manner of the confection that gives the film its title - though rather than some lovely sponge, cream and berries, this one consists of brutal henchmen, drug deals gone bad and violent bloodletting(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Paul Schrader's brilliant study of another alienated urban denizen skirting the borderline of madness stars Willem Dafoe as John Le Tour, a rich, upscale drug dealer for Manhattan professionals -- "White drugs for white people," as he puts it. John is a recovering addict and for him it's the perfect job, as he can relate completely with the self-absorbed eccentrics he services. But when his boss Ann (Susan Sarandon) tells John that she is planning to abandon the drug business for herbal cosmetics, John's life is thrown into disarray. With no future plans, he sees black clouds heading his way. Coincidentally, he runs into Marianne (Dana Delany), an old girlfriend and former addict who has returned to New York to be with her dying mother. John sees Marianne as his redemption and starts to pursue her, but she doesn't want to be reminded of her past. When the murder of an Upper West Side woman involved in a drug transaction has the police scouring the town for suspects, John thinks they are following him, and the strain upon his life and his hopes for the future become harder and harder to bear(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Canadian Bacon</title>
    <desc lang="en">In Michael Moore's political satire, the U.S. president (Alan Alda) decides to wage a cold war against Canada in an attempt to reverse his slipping popularity, and, as a result, he drives a small group of incensed Canadians to take matters into their own hands. Alda is the first president in years not to lead his country into war, which naturally means that his approval rating is dangerously low. The sure-fire way to boost his popularity is to start a war and demonstrate American superiority. Unfortunately, as his advisors point out, the U.S. has run out of enemies. That is, until Alda's National Security Advisor Stuart Smiley (Kevin Pollak) happens to catch a segment on the news about a brawl at a Canadian hockey game that began when local American sheriff Bud Boomer (John Candy) made a remark about Canadian beer. This incident gives Smiley the notion to make the public believe that Canada is their new enemy. Determined to demonstrate the mighty power of America to the Canadians, Boomer gets a group of equally angry fellow Americans together to cross the border and perform the most serious of all Canadian crimes -- littering. However, the invasion is foiled and Boomer's numerous blunders threaten to turn a fabricated war into a real one. Written, directed, and produced by Michael Moore, Canadian Bacon takes lighthearted jabs at the differences between the U.S. and Canada, while also satirizing America's obsession with its military strength. The film features John Candy in his last complete screen performance(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The time-honored "men in drag" concept gets a teen sex comedy makeover with this farce from director Wallace Wolodarsky. Dave (Barry Watson), Adam (Michael Rosenbaum), and Doofer (Harland Williams) are a trio of broke playboy misogynists who are accused of embezzlement by their frat brothers and kicked out. The friends quickly find themselves with only one option if they wish to remain on campus rent-free and nab the real culprits: the sorority known as Delta Omicron Gamma (D.O.G.), an institution widely known for its members' deficiency of physical beauty. After undergoing radical transformations thanks to wigs, makeup, and some serious depilatory efforts, the boys are soon passing themselves off as Daisy, Adena, and Roberta. It's not long before their past mistreatment of women has come back to haunt them, while Dave falls in love with Leah (Melissa Sagemiller), the head of the sorority, forcing him to consider when and where to confess the truth. In the meantime, the boys draw closer to learning the identity of the real thieves. Sorority Boys (2002) co-stars Heather Matarazzo(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Sorority Boys</title>
    <desc lang="en">The time-honored "men in drag" concept gets a teen sex comedy makeover with this farce from director Wallace Wolodarsky. Dave (Barry Watson), Adam (Michael Rosenbaum), and Doofer (Harland Williams) are a trio of broke playboy misogynists who are accused of embezzlement by their frat brothers and kicked out. The friends quickly find themselves with only one option if they wish to remain on campus rent-free and nab the real culprits: the sorority known as Delta Omicron Gamma (D.O.G.), an institution widely known for its members' deficiency of physical beauty. After undergoing radical transformations thanks to wigs, makeup, and some serious depilatory efforts, the boys are soon passing themselves off as Daisy, Adena, and Roberta. It's not long before their past mistreatment of women has come back to haunt them, while Dave falls in love with Leah (Melissa Sagemiller), the head of the sorority, forcing him to consider when and where to confess the truth. In the meantime, the boys draw closer to learning the identity of the real thieves. Sorority Boys (2002) co-stars Heather Matarazzo(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Caveman's Valentine</title>
    <desc lang="en">A man struggles back from madness to avenge the death of someone he knew in an intelligent thriller based on the acclaimed novel by George Dawes Green. Romulus Ledbetter (Samuel L. Jackson) once had a career as an acclaimed concert pianist, a position at the Juilliard School of Music, and a loving wife and children. But Ledbetter's life has been devastated by paranoid schizophrenia; now homeless, Ledbetter wanders the streets of New York City as he rails against Cornelius Gould Stuyvesant, a man whom he believes controls all the evil in the world while following his movements from a perch atop the Chrysler Building. Most nights, Ledbetter takes shelter in a cave in Central Park, earning him the nickname "the Caveman." One morning, Ledbetter discovers a frozen corpse caught in the branches of a tree near his cave; the body is that of Scotty (Sean MacMahaon), a homeless drug addict who was close friends with his pal Matthew (Rodney Eastman). Ledbetter is determined to get justice for Scotty, and he's also eager to prove himself to his daughter Lulu (Aunjanue Ellis), now a New York City police officer. While Ledbetter is at first convinced that his nemesis Stuyvesant is responsible for Scotty's death, in time he focuses on another suspect: David Leppenraub (Colm Feore), a famous photographer known for his controversial erotic images of young men, who occasionally hired Scotty as a model. As Ledbetter attempts to investigate Leppenraub's possible role in the murder, he soon gains an unexpected ally -- Moira (Ann Magnuson), a noted sculptor and Leppenraub's sister. The Caveman's Valentine marked the major-studio debut for director Kasi Lemmons, who made an impressive debut in 1997 with the independent drama Eve's Bayou(n)</desc>
