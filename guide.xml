    <desc lang="en">Directed by Walter Salles Jr., this remake of Hideo Nakata's supernatural psychological drama Honogurai Mizuno Soko Kara revolves around the plight of a single mother (Jennifer Connelly) whose messy divorce and subsequent battle for the custody of her five-year-old daughter is taking a heavy toll on her emotional well-being. Ultimately, the mother and daughter are able to relocate to an apartment, which, despite its excessively dilapidated interior, seems to be an adequate location for beginning a new life. Before long, however, what appears to be the spirit of a young girl begins to haunt them. No stranger to mental illness, the wary young woman brushes the visions aside as part of the inherent stress of making the transition from housewife to working, single mom. As time goes by and the apparent haunting does not subside, the apartment's new residents are forced to examine the history of its former tenants. Dark Water also features performances from John C. Reilly, Tim Roth, and Dougray Scott(n)</desc>

This time the story line returns to the Haddonfield, IL, family home of serial killer Michael Myers (Brad Loree), now the site of a contest where six college students are dared to spend the night, as their experience is broadcast live on the Internet. Their personalities and motivations are varying: Sara (Bianca Kajlich) is a shy psychology major; Jen (Katee Sackhoff) hopes to launch a broadcasting career; Rudy (Sean Patrick Thomas) is a culinary arts student; Bill (Thomas Ian Nicholas) is a womanizing law student; Jim (Luke Kirby) is a rebellious musician; and Donna (Daisy McCrackin) is a brainy skeptic. Believing that the night is nothing more than a stunt that will provide them with scholarship money, the ill-advised participants are soon shuffling off their mortal coils thanks to Michael's typically ghoulish but creative methods of homicide. In the meantime, Michael's sister, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), is a suicidal mute, incarcerated and hospitalized for the murder of an innocent man she wrongly believed was her brother three years earlier, but a confrontation between the combative siblings is brewing.

Stranded in the harsh terrain of Mongolia's Gobi Desert (a departure from the original, in which the plane crashed in the Sahara), Frank and his navigator face an equal challenge in maintaining order among the survivors. The group of oilmen had planned on an uneventful trip to shut off a group of rigs falling below their productivity expectations -- not fending for their very lives. Before long, some men are revealed as cowards, while others exhibit a surprising show of strength, all the while hoping that the wreckage of the original plane can be salvaged before a Lord of the Flies situation occurs. Miranda Otto is featured in a supporting role, as well as Giovanni Ribisi and Tyrese Gibson(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In a special edition of the detective drama that features only two members of the team, Gerry Standing and Steve McAndrew travel to Glasgow, where a new Ucos section is being set up. While there, they agree to assist the investigation into the 1993 unsolved murder of James Soutar, the wealthy owner of a string of betting shops. Cathy Sinclair, one of the beneficiaries of the bookie's will at his death, had a care-home upbringing in common with Soutar, but she claims to have no idea who he was or why she was left £15,000. McAndrew has a personal stake in the case - the original investigating officer was corrupt cop Frank McNair, who had an affair with his wife, and their paths soon cross. The London-based officers' questions begin to unsettle someone and a campaign of victimisation against them begins, but it's a revelation from McAndrew's girlfriend Charley that reawakens a long-dormant scandal and clears the path to a solution. Dennis Waterman and Denis Lawson star.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Horizon: Dippy and the Whale.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Over the past two years, the staff of the Natural History Museum has undertaken a super-sized challenge - to take down its famous cast of a dinosaur skeleton in the entrance hall and replace it with an equally impressive skeleton of a blue whale - the largest animal to have lived. This documentary follows the teams of conservators and engineers as they take apart the diplodocus - known to staff and visitors as Dippy - bone by bone, ready for a countrywide tour and then get the whale ready to go on display - all without closing the museum to the public. Narrated by David Attenborough.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Urban Jungles.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The documentary focuses on small creatures in an urban setting. In Rio de Janeiro, marmosets use power-lines as they would tree branches to scour the streets for food, and one animal becomes separated from its group and is forced to the ground, where it confronts the dangers of the city alone. Almost 11,000 miles away in the neon metropolis of Tokyo, a rhinoceros beetle begins an extraordinary journey to find sanctuary on a rare patch of greenery, along the way facing predatory bats, eight-eyed jumping spiders, praying mantises and a sharp-eyed crow. Including Hidden Kingdoms Revealed, showing how the film was made. Narrated by Stephen Fry. Last in the series.(n)</desc>

She investigates how the focus has shifted from viewing them as brutal barbarians to pioneering traders, able to integrate into multiple cultures.

    <desc lang="en">Clare Balding uncovers the hidden history of women's football. A hundred years ago, the women's game dominated the headlines and attracted crowds of up to 60,000. The star players everyone wanted to see were teenage striker Lily Parr and her teammate Alice Woods, and the most popular team in England was Dick, Kerr's Ladies. Clare reveals how women's football teams grew out of munitions factories during the First World War where women had replaced men sent into battle. It also uncovers an untold chapter in the fight for equality waged at a time when women ruled the pitch.(n)</desc>

His work was considered to be ahead of its time - so much so that it was all but ignored for 300 years. El Greco developed a highly individualistic style that eventually proved enormously influential, paving the way for the Baroque and providing the inspiration for 20th-century expressionism.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Scent of a Woman</title>
    <desc lang="en">Driven by an extravagant, tour-de-force performance by Al Pacino, Scent of a Woman is the story of Frank Slade (Pacino), a blind, retired army colonel who hires Charlie Simms (Chris O'Donnell), a poor college student on the verge of expulsion, to take care of him over Thanksgiving weekend. At the beginning of the weekend, Frank takes Charlie to New York, where he reveals to the student that he intends to visit his family, have a few terrific meals, sleep with a beautiful woman and, finally, commit suicide. The film follows the mis-matched pair over the course of the weekend, as they learn about life through their series of adventures. Though the story is a little contrived and predictable, it pulls all the right strings, thanks to O'Donnell's sympathetic supporting role and Pacino's powerful lead performance, for which he won his first Academy Award. Scent of a Woman is based on the 1975 Italian film Profumo Di Donna(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Any Given Sunday</title>
    <desc lang="en">Oliver Stone takes on professional football, a sport whose grace and delicacy are a good match for his filmmaking style. Tony D'Amato (Al Pacino), the head coach of the Miami Sharks, won back-to-back championships four years ago. But new team owner Christina Pagniacci (Cameron Diaz) has little enthusiasm for the finer points of the game and is concerned only with the bottom line. The longtime strongman of Tony's team has been "Cap" Rooney (Dennis Quaid), a 39-year-old quarterback, but Christina balks at renewing his contract. When Cap is injured during a game, third-string rookie quarterback Willie Beaman (Jamie Foxx) goes on in his place and becomes a major star. But Beaman is mostly interested in fame and money, and he has little regard for Tony and his teammates. Any Given Sunday also stars James Woods as the team's doctor, LL Cool J as a star running back, Jim Brown as a former football great turned Sharks' defensive coordinator, Ann-Margret as Christina's alcoholic mother, Bill Bellamy as a wide receiver, Elizabeth Berkley as Tony's favorite prostitute, and Charlton Heston as the football commissioner(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">It's Christmas time in L.A., and there's an employee party in progress on the 30th floor of the Nakatomi Corporation building. The revelry comes to a violent end when the partygoers are taken hostage by a group of terrorists headed by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), who plan to steal the 600 million dollars locked in Nakatomi's high-tech safe. In truth, Gruber and his henchmen are only pretending to be politically motivated to throw the authorities off track; also in truth, Gruber has no intention of allowing anyone to get out of the building alive. Meanwhile, New York cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) has come to L.A. to visit his estranged wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), who happens to be one of the hostages. Disregarding the orders of the authorities surrounding the building, McClane, who fears nothing (except heights), takes on the villains, armed with one handgun and plenty of chutzpah. Until Die Hard came along, Bruce Willis was merely that wisecracking guy on Moonlighting. After the film's profits started rolling in, Willis found himself one of the highest-paid and most sought-after leading men in Hollywood(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Scent of a Woman</title>
    <desc lang="en">Driven by an extravagant, tour-de-force performance by Al Pacino, Scent of a Woman is the story of Frank Slade (Pacino), a blind, retired army colonel who hires Charlie Simms (Chris O'Donnell), a poor college student on the verge of expulsion, to take care of him over Thanksgiving weekend. At the beginning of the weekend, Frank takes Charlie to New York, where he reveals to the student that he intends to visit his family, have a few terrific meals, sleep with a beautiful woman and, finally, commit suicide. The film follows the mis-matched pair over the course of the weekend, as they learn about life through their series of adventures. Though the story is a little contrived and predictable, it pulls all the right strings, thanks to O'Donnell's sympathetic supporting role and Pacino's powerful lead performance, for which he won his first Academy Award. Scent of a Woman is based on the 1975 Italian film Profumo Di Donna(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Any Given Sunday</title>
    <desc lang="en">Oliver Stone takes on professional football, a sport whose grace and delicacy are a good match for his filmmaking style. Tony D'Amato (Al Pacino), the head coach of the Miami Sharks, won back-to-back championships four years ago. But new team owner Christina Pagniacci (Cameron Diaz) has little enthusiasm for the finer points of the game and is concerned only with the bottom line. The longtime strongman of Tony's team has been "Cap" Rooney (Dennis Quaid), a 39-year-old quarterback, but Christina balks at renewing his contract. When Cap is injured during a game, third-string rookie quarterback Willie Beaman (Jamie Foxx) goes on in his place and becomes a major star. But Beaman is mostly interested in fame and money, and he has little regard for Tony and his teammates. Any Given Sunday also stars James Woods as the team's doctor, LL Cool J as a star running back, Jim Brown as a former football great turned Sharks' defensive coordinator, Ann-Margret as Christina's alcoholic mother, Bill Bellamy as a wide receiver, Elizabeth Berkley as Tony's favorite prostitute, and Charlton Heston as the football commissioner(n)</desc>

La Costa del Sol se convirtió en un refugio para muchos criminales británicos en los años '90 gracias a un acuerdo de extradición muy ambígua e informal entre España y Reino Unido. Así estos fugitivos pudieran esconderse de la justicia entre los vacacionistas que acuden cada año a la región. Uno de ellos, David Baxendale, era violento y adicto al alcohol y las drogas. Ya había apuñalado a dos personas en Inglaterra y cumplió condena en prisión por ambos delitos. En la Costa del Sol, Baxendale, después de haber bebido demasiado, apuñaló a un hombre 14 veces. A pesar de una condena por asesinato, sus crímenes continuaban. Finalmente mientras cumplía libertad condicional en Inglaterra, acompañó a una mujer a su departamento, entro en un ataque de cólera y de una puñalada al cuello, le cortó la arteria carótida(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May immerse themselves in nostalgia and try to prove that hot hatches from their younger days are better than today's equivalents. Jeremy grabs the keys to a Volkswagen Golf GTI, Richard takes the wheel of a Vauxhall Nova SRi and James May opts for the Ford Fiesta XR2i, and the trio set off on a road trip that includes a hill climb and a visit to a supermarket. However, their adventure concludes at an army training ground in Wales, where they and their steeds must face the heavily armed Top Gear Police Department.

    <title lang="en">Top Gear</title>
    <desc lang="en">Richard Hammond gets behind the wheel of the mid-engined Alfa Romeo 4C on the shores of Lake Como in Italy - but his enjoyment of the lightweight vehicle is disturbed by the arrival of Jeremy Clarkson, who demands a race against his quad bike. Jeremy also visits Belgium, putting the McLaren P1 hypercar to the test in Bruges and around the Spa-Francorchamps Formula One circuit - and its combined power output of more than 900bhp generated from electricity and turbocharged petrol V8 power is likely to cause astonishment. Meanwhile, James May spends time at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan to learn about the army's vehicle redeployment efforts, and Thor star Tom Hiddleston tries to coax the best time he can muster from the Reasonably Priced Car.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">David Attenborough examines how the arrival of winter sparks a ruthless battle for survival in the polar regions, with temperatures plummeting to -70C, winds reaching 120mph and day-long darkness. As a blizzard rages, a polar bear treks into the Arctic mountains to give birth, while the entire world population of spectacled eider braves the weather in a giant ice hole. Wolves and bison engage in battle, but alliances are also made, and beneath the snow, voles try to dodge the attacks of great grey owls and weasels.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The effect of the rainy season on wildlife in Asia, with floods forcing animals to flee from Kaziranga National Park in north-east India in search of the safety of the hills. In Cambodia, the Mekong river swells so much that water is forced back up one of its tributaries to fill the vast Tonle Sap lake - one of the most productive freshwater fisheries on Earth. Fresh grass draws nomads and their vast herds of livestock back to their homelands, but they are stalked by hungry wolves and hyenas, which move in at night for the kill. Colin Salmon narrates.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The effect of the rainy season on wildlife in Asia, with floods forcing animals to flee from Kaziranga National Park in north-east India in search of the safety of the hills. In Cambodia, the Mekong river swells so much that water is forced back up one of its tributaries to fill the vast Tonle Sap lake - one of the most productive freshwater fisheries on Earth. Fresh grass draws nomads and their vast herds of livestock back to their homelands, but they are stalked by hungry wolves and hyenas, which move in at night for the kill. Colin Salmon narrates.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Varsity Blues</title>
    <desc lang="en">Dawson's Creek hunk James Van Der Beek breaks onto the big screen in this high school drama about American football. He's joined by Jon Voight as Coach Kilmer, a veteran who just wants his successful team to keep winning prizes. That's placed in jeopardy when the team's star captain is injured and the little-known quarterback John Moxon , a player with his own approach to the game, steps into his shoes(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Gerard Butler stars in Marc Forster's violent, fact-based drama about a substance-addicted criminal who finds God and relocates to Sudan to offer his own idiosyncratic brand of Christian charity. The film initially portrays Sam Childers as being a far from nice man: a misogynistic biker whose life is steeped in crime, narcotics and violence, and who quickly returns to armed robbery almost as soon as he's released from jail. But while he was inside, his wife Lynn found Jesus, and, after Sam gets stabbed, she urges him to join her at church. Sam subsequently has his own Damascene moment and starts life afresh, founding his own (legitimate) construction company. Before long he has also built his own church. But it's only after a trip to Sudan, where he witnesses the devastation wrought by the marauding Lord's Resistance Army, that he truly becomes driven. Relocating to the African country, he sets up a faith-based centre to care for victims of the LRA's violence and rape. And also takes up arms to literally fight the good fight... Also starring Michael Shannon(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Way We Was. After their TV goes on the blink, the Simpson family is faced with the grim prospect of having to actually talk to each other, and Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) decides to make the best of it by telling Lisa (voice of Yeardley Smith) and Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright) the story of how she and Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) fell in love. It's 1974, and Homer Simpson is a skinny guy with a full head of hair who has no idea of what he wants to do with his future. Marge Bouvier has ended up in detention for the first time after burning a bra on school property in the midst of a brief infatuation with the women's movement. There she meets Homer, who has been kept after school yet again for smoking on school grounds. For Homer, it's love at first sight, and he's determined to find some way to get Marge's attention; pretending to be studying French, Homer gets Marge to tutor him, then asks her to the big dance. Marge says yes, but she's furious when she learns Homer isn't really taking French and that he kept her up late the night before a major forensics tournament. Marge decides instead to accept an invitation from debate club president Arnie Ziff (voice of Jon Lovitz) to go to the prom. Homer, however, never hears about this, figuring that if she never formally broke off their date, she'll still go with him, no matter how angry she is, and he finds himself going to the prom stag and watching Marge enjoy her big night with Artie. The Way We Was first aired on January 31, 1991(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Last Exit to Springfield. It's time for the workers at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant to negotiate a new contract with management, but their union representative has gone missing, so a handful of employees take it upon themselves to present their demands to owner C. Montgomery Burns (voice of Harry Shearer). One of those employees is Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta), who regrettably agrees to remove dental insurance from the employee benefit plan in the new contract in exchange for some free beer. Homer's decision comes back to haunt him when he finds out that his daughter Lisa (voice of Yeardley Smith) needs braces; Homer then persuades his fellow employees to vote down Burns' contract, and Homer is named the new union representative in the plant. Burns vows not to give in to the employee's demands, and finally Homer and his fellows go out on strike. In the meantime, Lisa still needs her braces, and the family is forced to settle on the cheapest they can find, which are even more conspicuous and unsightly than the average pair. "Last Exit to Springfield" was first aired on March 11, 1993(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">After six weeks of heats, 60 hopefuls have been whittled down to the most promising six. Now it's the first of the semi-finals, in which they face a big catering challenge - in Albert Square of all places. The busy EastEnders cast and crew have strictly one hour for lunch and their schedule is tight, so the two teams - serving 60 main courses and 60 desserts each from specially constructed tents - cannot be late. After that challenge it's back to the studio to come up with their own refined dish, before Gregg Wallace and John Torode send one of the hopefuls home.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">After six weeks of heats, 60 hopefuls have been whittled down to the most promising six. Now it's the first of the semi-finals, in which they face a big catering challenge - in Albert Square of all places. The busy EastEnders cast and crew have strictly one hour for lunch and their schedule is tight, so the two teams - serving 60 main courses and 60 desserts each from specially constructed tents - cannot be late. After that challenge it's back to the studio to come up with their own refined dish, before Gregg Wallace and John Torode send one of the hopefuls home.(n)</desc>

When Brody (Epps) and Guch (Wood Harris) received package containing 10 kilos of grade-A cocaine, they assumed their financial woes were a thing of the past. The package was intended for their Brody and Guch's next-door neighbors, but the whacked-out courier (Donald Faison) delivered it to the wrong address. Recognizing the possibility for profit, the scheming duo plans to sell the cocaine to Brody's drug-dealing cousin (Omari Hardwick). Meanwhile Jesus (Cisco Reyes) and his girlfriend Chita (Yasmin Deliz), the intended recipients of the cocaine, set out to procure the package before notorious drug lord Bodego Diablo (Emilio Rivera) realizes it's gone missing. But Bodega is no slouch; he already knows the shipment was botched, and he's determined to get his drugs back no matter what the cost. Later, as Brody and Guch prepare to seal the deal that will set them up for life, the guns are drawn and the chaos begins(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Speed Racer</title>
    <desc lang="en">The Matrix masterminds Andy and Larry Wachowski usher anime icon Tatsuo Yoshida's classic 1960s-era hit into the new millennium with this family-friendly story of a young racecar driver who takes on the mysterious Racer X in a custom-made, gadget-loaded speed machine named the Mach 5. Speed Racer (Emile Hirsch) is the kind of driver that every wheelman wishes he could be: a born winner whose unbeatable combination of aggression, instinct, and fearlessness always finds him crossing the checkered flag with a comfortable lead. In Speed Racer's mind, the only driver who could present him with any real challenge is his late brother -- the legendary Rex Racer. Rex died in a heated cross-country rally known as The Crucible many years ago, and now his younger sibling is driven to fulfill the legacy that Rex left behind. To this day, Speed Racer is fiercely loyal to family. It was Speed Racer's father, Pops Racer (John Goodman), who designed the unbeatable Mach 5, and even a lucrative offer from racing giants Royalton Industries isn't enough to get the young ace to break his family ties. Upon turning down Royalton's (Roger Allam) astronomical offer, Speed Racer makes the shocking discovery that the outcomes of the biggest races are being predetermined by a handful of powerful moguls who pad their profits by manipulating the drivers. Realizing that his career would be ruined if word of the fix gets out, Royalton vows that the Mach 5 will never make it to another finish line. Now, the only way for Speed Racer to save the family business and beat Royalton at his own game will be to win the very same race that claimed his brother's life so many years ago. In order to accomplish that formidable feat, however, Speed Racer will not only have to rely on his family and the aid of his longtime girlfriend, Trixie (Christina Ricci), but form a tenuous alliance with his longtime rival -- the mysterious Racer X (Matthew Fox) -- as well(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Speed Racer</title>
    <desc lang="en">The Matrix masterminds Andy and Larry Wachowski usher anime icon Tatsuo Yoshida's classic 1960s-era hit into the new millennium with this family-friendly story of a young racecar driver who takes on the mysterious Racer X in a custom-made, gadget-loaded speed machine named the Mach 5. Speed Racer (Emile Hirsch) is the kind of driver that every wheelman wishes he could be: a born winner whose unbeatable combination of aggression, instinct, and fearlessness always finds him crossing the checkered flag with a comfortable lead. In Speed Racer's mind, the only driver who could present him with any real challenge is his late brother -- the legendary Rex Racer. Rex died in a heated cross-country rally known as The Crucible many years ago, and now his younger sibling is driven to fulfill the legacy that Rex left behind. To this day, Speed Racer is fiercely loyal to family. It was Speed Racer's father, Pops Racer (John Goodman), who designed the unbeatable Mach 5, and even a lucrative offer from racing giants Royalton Industries isn't enough to get the young ace to break his family ties. Upon turning down Royalton's (Roger Allam) astronomical offer, Speed Racer makes the shocking discovery that the outcomes of the biggest races are being predetermined by a handful of powerful moguls who pad their profits by manipulating the drivers. Realizing that his career would be ruined if word of the fix gets out, Royalton vows that the Mach 5 will never make it to another finish line. Now, the only way for Speed Racer to save the family business and beat Royalton at his own game will be to win the very same race that claimed his brother's life so many years ago. In order to accomplish that formidable feat, however, Speed Racer will not only have to rely on his family and the aid of his longtime girlfriend, Trixie (Christina Ricci), but form a tenuous alliance with his longtime rival -- the mysterious Racer X (Matthew Fox) -- as well(n)</desc>

But he's also suffered setbacks in his personal life, from being arrested with a loaded gun at an airport to being accused by his co-star in the TV show Martin of sexual harassment. In this outstanding film of his stand-up routine, he confronts his demons and those who demonise him, as well as veering off to his favourite subject: women, and how hard they are to live with. And 'rundletat' is short for 'run and tell that'(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Six Feet Under creator and American Beauty screenwriter Alan Ball makes his feature directorial debut with this screen adaptation of author Alicia Erian's controversial novel Towelhead. Jasira (Summer Bishil) is a 13-year-old Arab-American who's contending with the pains of adolescence when her life takes a sudden and unexpected turn. Sent to live with her stern Lebanese father, Rifat (Peter Macdissi), by her self-absorbed mother (Maria Bello), Jasira finds herself struggling to adjust to life in the suburbs while contending with racism and hypocrisy at every turn. Rifat lives in a modest, suburban Houston home next to racist reservist Mr. Vuoso (Aaron Eckhart) and meddling expectant mother Melina (Toni Collette). Adjusting to life in the suburbs isn't easy for young Jasira, though she tries her hardest to adapt to the unfamiliar environment by striking up casual conversations with her curious new neighbors. In the process, Jasira finds herself increasingly attracted to hormone-driven African-American teen Thomas (Eugene Jones). When Rifat finds out that his daughter's new boyfriend is black, he vehemently condemns the relationship. As America launches its initial invasion of Iraq, Jasira finds herself caught up in a potentially explosive situation that is only compounded by her raging hormones and the snooping of her pregnant, busybody neighbor(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Happening</title>
    <desc lang="en">Lady in the Water director M. Night Shyamalan puts PG-13 suspense on pause to tell this grim apocalyptic tale about a family fleeing a natural disaster that poses a grave threat to the whole of humanity. Philadelphia high-school science teacher Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) is discussing the disappearance of the bees with his students when the staff is summoned to the theater and briefed about a mysterious event that is currently unfolding in New York City. According to reports, citizens in the vicinity of Central Park have suddenly and inexplicably begun seizing up just before killing themselves by whatever means are at their disposal. As the phenomena begins to spread and talk of terrorism fills the airwaves, Elliot, his wife, Alma (Zooey Deschanel), their friend Julian (John Leguizamo), and his daughter, Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez), board a train bound for the presumed safety of the country. When the train screeches to a halt before arriving at its final destination, however, the frightened passengers are forced to fend for themselves as each consecutive news report paints an increasingly grim picture of the situation in more urbanized areas. Theories abound on what could be causing the unexplainable rash of suicides, but the only thing that everyone seems to agree on is that it's some kind of airborne contagion that is carried in the wind. It would appear that humankind's reign on planet Earth has come to an end, but perhaps if this small band of survivors can find a safe place to lie low until this all blows over, all hope for survival of the species might not be lost just yet(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Director John Woo brings Hong Kong-style martial arts action to this comic book-flavored sequel that eschews the complicated plot and political maneuverings of its predecessor in favor of pure, adrenaline-charged thrills. Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt, an operative for the top-secret government agency IMF (Impossible Missions Force). Fellow agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) has gone rogue, stealing a sample of a deadly synthetic virus named Chimera that could rapidly wipe out the world's population. Ambrose's plan is to sell Chimera to the highest bidder in exchange for shares of stock in the winner's company. Summoned by the new IMF chief (Anthony Hopkins in an uncredited cameo role), Ethan is assigned to recruit the help of Ambrose's former lover Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton), a gorgeous woman who left Ambrose broken-hearted and who may be able to quickly regain his confidence. Once he meets and spends a night with Nyah, however, Ethan is smitten, and now must both capture Ambrose and keep Nyah alive as she infiltrates a nest of vipers. Sophisticated disguises, gun battles, and high-speed chases are the order of the day, very much in the James Bond mold. Mission: Impossible 2 is based on a story by Star Trek: The Next Generation writers Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga, with a script polish by Robert Towne(n)</desc>

The handsome jocks of Alpha Beta, led by Stan (Ted McGinley), run Adams College, which means that when they burn down their house after a stunt involving grain alcohol and an open flame, they kick a bunch of socially inept freshman out of their dorm and into the gymnasium. But sleeping on cots is only the beginning of their worries, as the so-called nerds soon become the target of pranks by Alpha Beta, assisted by Betty (Julie Montgomery) and the gorgeous gals of Pi Delta Pi. Instead of taking the abuse sitting down, the displaced freshman, led by Gilbert (Anthony Edwards) and Lewis (Robert Carradine), buy a ramshackle house, affiliate themselves with the only national chapter who will take them (the all-black Lambda Lambda Lambda), and use their superior intellect to launch a counterstrike. The bespectacled but loveable geeks set up surveillance cameras in the Pi bathroom and put liquid heat in the athletes' jock straps, then draft a sister sorority of misfits (Omega Mu) to strengthen their resources. The frats quickly become bitter rivals, and the goal is to win the annual fraternity decathlon, which involves such feats as a burping contest and a go-cart race, with bragging rights (and perhaps peace of mind) at stake. Look for John Goodman and future thirtysomething cast member Timothy Busfield in small roles, and expect a torrent of nasal laughter(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Documentary examining the famous Second World War evacuation of Allied soldiers - codenamed Operation Dynamo - from the beaches of Dunkirk, France, between May 26 and June 4, 1940. Recently released Ministry of Defence files reveal that, far from being absent as many historians have believed, the RAF was suffering massive losses supporting the evacuation. Operating at high altitude and deep inside France, RAF planes were halting the bulk of Luftwaffe bombers before they could reach the beaches. The files also reveal that the famous Spitfire took flight for the first time during the mission, and the agile fighter was a spectacular success.(n)</desc>

Jack (George Clooney) is lucky to be alive after his Swedish assignment went sour, and he knows that it's only a matter of time before his luck runs out. Not eager to tempt fate again, Jack arrives in a small Italian town and takes a job assembling a weapon for the mysterious Mathilde (Thekla Reuten). During this uncharacteristically peaceful interlude, Jack befriends kindly clergyman Father Benedetto (Paolo Bonacelli), and connects with pretty local Clara (Violante Placido).

    <title lang="en">The Hills Have Eyes</title>
    <desc lang="en">Horror auteur Wes Craven followed his threadbare but horrifically compelling cult classic Last House on the Left with this wonderfully demented morality fable about a bloody war of attrition between two extremely different families. The story opens on the journey of the Carters, a mildly dysfunctional extended family led by patriarch "Big Bob" Carter (Russ Grieve), as they travel across the California desert in search of an inherited silver mine. When a broken axle leaves them stranded in the middle of a former nuclear testing site, their attempts to find help lead them unwittingly into the territory of a savage family of cave-dwelling cannibals, the apparent progeny of the bearlike Jupiter (James Whitworth) and an abducted prostitute. Jupiter's eldest son Pluto (professional movie weirdo Michael Berryman) leads the first brutal attack on the defenseless Carters who, through necessity, are driven to equally extreme measures in order to survive. Though the film is not overtly bloody, the scenes depicting this confrontation are rendered with an unflinching directness, and the violations visited on the Carters are so brutal as to make the survivors' regression into savagery all the more convincing. No one is spared from the nightmare: Jupiter's boys have even kidnapped the youngest member of the Carter family -- a mere infant -- to serve as fodder for their next barbecue, and the baby becomes the main point of contention between the rival clans. Craven nevertheless refuses to take the easy way out by depicting his "monsters" as soullessly evil; parallels between either family's "values" are clearly drawn as the differences between the two clans begin to blur(n)</desc>

Craven nevertheless refuses to take the easy way out by depicting his "monsters" as soullessly evil; parallels between either family's "values" are clearly drawn as the differences between the two clans begin to blur(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Halloween</title>
    <desc lang="en">The Devil's Rejects director Rob Zombie resurrects one of the most notorious slashers in screen history with this re-imagining of the 1978 John Carpenter classic that spawned numerous sequels and countless imitators. As a child, young Michael Myers (Daeg Faerch) committed one of the most unspeakable crimes imaginable. Subsequently locked in an asylum and placed under the care of Dr. Loomis (Malcolm McDowell), the hollow-eyed boy grew into an emotionless man determined to escape back to his hometown of Haddonfield and complete the murderous mission that he began so many years back. These days, the long-abandoned Myers house sits decrepit and overgrown on a peaceful suburban street, its boarded windows and rotting wood a silent testament to the slaughter that has haunted Haddonfield for decades. Now Michael Myers (Tyler Mane) is back, and as the children of this typical Midwestern town fill the sidewalks for a fun-filled night of tricks and treats, Haddonfield is about to find out that there is no escape from pure evil. Brad Dourif, William Forsythe, Udo Kier, Dee Wallace, Sheri Moon Zombie, Danny Trejo, and Adrienne Barbeau co-star(n)</desc>

As Nick makes believe he isn't homeless in between beers, he strikes up a friendship with a kid from the neighborhood (Christopher Jordan Wallace), tries to reconnect with a girl he loved in high school (Laura Dern), and bonds with his neighbor Samantha (Rebecca Hall), who is pregnant and struggling to get by while her husband is away on business.

The first is about a killer car; the second's a zombie flick. In the opener, Kurt Russell plays a stuntman wreaking havoc with his wheels of death.

    <title lang="en">On Her Majesty's Secret Service</title>
    <desc lang="en">Supposedly, when Sean Connery refused to star in another James Bond movie, producers Harry Saltzman and Albert Broccoli vowed to show up the insolent Connery by literally "creating" a new Bond from the ground up. That's why professional model and TV commercial-spokesman George Lazenby is cast as 007 in the 1969 filmization of Ian Fleming's 1963 Bond novel On Her Majesty's Secret Service. As a result, the film is one of the few in the series that could boast more than a passing resemblance to the Fleming original. This time around, Bond quits the secret service when he is told to end his obsessive search for master criminal Blofeld (Telly Savalas). While trailing his quarry in Portugal, Bond falls in love with Tracy Draco (Diana Rigg), daughter of a notorious gangster (Gabriele Ferzetti). The elder Draco agrees to help Bond find Blofeld, with the implicit understanding that Bond will marry Tracy. Bond's mission takes him to a Swiss mountain retreat, wherein Blofeld is executing his master plan of destroying the world's agricultural economy. When all is said and done, Bond does marry Tracy, but the honeymoon ends in sudden tragedy(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">All the King's Men</title>
    <desc lang="en">The legacy of a populist Southern politician whose lofty ambitions for the future leave him open to corruption and scandal is detailed as author Robert Penn Warren's thinly veiled portrait of Depression-era Louisiana governor Huey Long comes to the screen -- again -- this time courtesy of director and screenwriter Steven Zaillian. Willie Stark (Sean Penn) is a man of the people, and for the people; at least that's what he tells the people. Propelled into a race for governor by opposing forces looking to split the "hick vote," Stark is convinced by a handler -- as well as by young journalist Jack Burden (Jude Law) -- to not kowtow to the powers that be. His rhetoric grows fiery, and he makes his way into office on a not-so-solid foundation of social-service promises. When idealism gives way to the harsh realities of the time, however, the fast-talking politico is quick to discover just how far one can fall when ambition and power lead to a betrayal of one's original motivations. Kate Winslet, Patricia Clarkson, James Gandolfini, Mark Ruffalo, and Anthony Hopkins round out an all-star cast in this second version of Warren's Pulitzer Prize-winning 1947 novel; the first won a parade of Oscars after its release in 1949(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Drama based on Richard Yates's acclaimed novel, reuniting the Titanic stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. April and Frank Wheeler are a young, thriving couple living with their two children in a Connecticut suburb in the mid-1950s. Their self-assured exterior masks a creeping frustration at their inability to feel fulfilled in their relationships or careers. Frank is mired in a well-paying but boring office job, and April is a housewife still mourning the demise of her hoped-for acting career. Determined to identify themselves as superior to the mediocre sprawl of suburbanites who surround them, they decide to move to France where they will be better able to develop their true artistic sensibilities, free of the consumerist demands of capitalist America. But as their relationship deteriorates into an endless cycle of squabbling, jealousy and recriminations, their trip and their dreams of self-fulfilment are thrown into jeopardy. Dir: Sam Mendes(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Town &amp; Country</title>
    <desc lang="en">This long-delayed romantic comedy from director Peter Chelsom stars Warren Beatty as a wealthy New York architect, Porter Stoddard. The revelation that his best friend Griffin (Garry Shandling) is cheating on his wife Mona (Goldie Hawn) leads to a mid-life crisis of sorts for Porter, jeopardizing his marriage to Ellie (Diane Keaton). When Mona leaves Griffin for her family's antebellum home in Mississippi, Porter accompanies her to lend his professional assistance in designing some home improvements and ends up entangled in a romantic assignation with his best friend's estranged wife. He then embarks on a series of other illicit, comical affairs. Among Porter's conquests are a cellist, Alex (Nastassja Kinski), the beautiful Eugenie (Andie MacDowell), and a Halloween reveler named Auburn (Jenna Elfman). He also runs afoul of Eugenie's overprotective father (Charlton Heston), who's armed with a shotgun and disturbingly unable to view his daughter as an adult. Town &amp; Country (2001) is based on a script co-written by Buck Henry(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Pure Luck</title>
    <desc lang="en">This wacky buddy comedy was the fifth in a series of Hollywood remakes of films by French director Francis Veber, none of which were box office successes. Sheila Kelley is Valerie Highsmith, an heiress who, despite her family's wealth, suffers from horribly bad luck. On a vacation to Mexico, she takes a fall, causing amnesia, then is mugged and kidnapped for ransom. When her father (Sam Wanamaker) becomes frustrated with the failed attempts of a detective, Ray Campanella (Danny Glover) to find his daughter, he teams a very reluctant Ray with Eugene Proctor (Martin Short), an accountant whose bumbling bad luck is even worse than Valerie's. The theory is that perhaps two such incredibly unlucky people will act like magnets, with Eugene leading Ray to Valerie's location. Although Ray finds Eugene irritating, the unlikely partners eventually begin making surprising progress in the case, despite Eugene's never-ending screw-ups and pratfalls(n)</desc>

Rev. Stephen Kumalo (James Earl Jones) is a minister from a poverty-stricken farming community who travels to Johannesburg for the first time in search of his son Absalom (Eric Miyeni), who moved to the city some time back and has gone missing. Kumalo regards the big city as a den of iniquity, and his low expectations are not betrayed; he is robbed and beaten shortly after he arrives, and when he visits his brother John (Charles S. Dutton), he discovers that Absalom has become a petty thief with a pregnant girlfriend, his sister Gertrude (Dambisa Kente) is a prostitute, and John has renounced his faith in God and advocates the violent overthrow of South Africa's white leadership. James Jarvis (Richard Harris) -- a wealthy white landowner from the same part of the country as Kumalo -- has also arrived in Johannesburg, also with sad personal business to attend to; his son, a well-liked activist for the rights of the city's black majority population, was killed during a robbery(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">British director Stephen Norrington helmed this David S. Goyer adaptation of the Marvel Comics character created in 1973 by scripter Marv Wolfman and artist Gene Colan. In the Tomb of Dracula comic book origin, just before Blade's mother gave birth to Blade, she was bitten by a vampire, which made Blade immune to vampires. Now a vampire hunter, Blade, joined by vampire detective Hannibal King and Dracula-descendent Frank Drake, stalks vampires. In the 1990s (in Marvel's Nightstalkers), Blade teamed with Drake and King in an agency created to fight a variety of supernatural beings. The Marvel origin is retold in this 1998 Norrington film, with Blade's mother dying as he is born. Thirty-some years later, Blade now exists somewhere between the two worlds, not human but not fully vampire. He has become a relentless and superhuman vampire hunter, out to avenge the death of his mother and protect the rest of humankind from the evil vampire race. In this pursuit, Blade storms a notorious vampire nightclub and in a virtual bloodbath manages to wipe out most of the blood-lusting denizens. But the burnt corpse of vampire Quinn (Donal Logue) is reanimated at the hospital morgue and bites hematologist Karen Jenson (N'Bushe Wright). Blade magically appears at the hospital just in time to whisk Karen to his hideaway, a machine-shop run by his mentor Abraham Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), who once rescued Blade and who now produces a antidote to keep Blade from turning into a full-fledged vampire and who builds custom weapons for Blade to use against his evil foes. Meanwhile, Blade's vampire arch-nemesis Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) uses computers to translate the Book of Erebus, with the ultimate aim of bringing down the old-guard vampire council, headed by Dragonetti (Udo Kier), and triggering the Blood Tide -- an event in which everyone in the world becomes a vampire(n)</desc>

In this pursuit, Blade storms a notorious vampire nightclub and in a virtual bloodbath manages to wipe out most of the blood-lusting denizens. But the burnt corpse of vampire Quinn (Donal Logue) is reanimated at the hospital morgue and bites hematologist Karen Jenson (N'Bushe Wright). Blade magically appears at the hospital just in time to whisk Karen to his hideaway, a machine-shop run by his mentor Abraham Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), who once rescued Blade and who now produces a antidote to keep Blade from turning into a full-fledged vampire and who builds custom weapons for Blade to use against his evil foes. Meanwhile, Blade's vampire arch-nemesis Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) uses computers to translate the Book of Erebus, with the ultimate aim of bringing down the old-guard vampire council, headed by Dragonetti (Udo Kier), and triggering the Blood Tide -- an event in which everyone in the world becomes a vampire(n)</desc>
