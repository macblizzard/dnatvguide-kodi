    <title lang="en">Malcolm X</title>
    <desc lang="en">Writer-director Spike Lee's epic portrayal of the life and times of the slain civil rights leader Malcolm X begins with the cross-cut imagery of the police beating of black motorist Rodney King juxtaposed with an American flag burning into the shape of the letter X. When the film's narrative begins moments later, it jumps back to World War II-era Boston, where Malcolm Little (Denzel Washington) is making his living as a hustler. The son of a Baptist preacher who was murdered by the Ku Klux Klan, Little was raised by foster parents after his mother was deemed clinically insane; as an adult, he turned to a life of crime, which leads to his imprisonment on burglary charges. In jail, Little receives epiphany in the form of an introduction to Islam; he is especially taken with the lessons of Elijah Mohammed, who comes to him in a vision. Adopting the name 'Malcolm X' as a rejection of the 'Little' surname (given his family by white slave owners), he meets the real Elijah Mohammed (Al Freeman, Jr.) upon exiting prison, and begins work as a spokesman for the Nation of Islam. Marriage to a Muslim nurse named Betty Shabazz (Angela Bassett) follows, after which X spearheads a well-attended march on a Harlem hospital housing a Muslim recovering from an episode of police brutality. The march's success helps elevate X to the position of Islam's national spokesperson. There is dissension in the ranks, however, and soon X is targeted for assassination by other Nation leaders; even Elijah Mohammed fears Malcolm's growing influence.

    <title lang="en">Big Daddy</title>
    <desc lang="en">Prospective parents everywhere, meet the world's least likely paternal role model: Adam Sandler! In Big Daddy, Sandler plays 30-year-old bachelor Sonny Koufax, a carefree slob who has never much taken to adult responsibilities; he works one day a week as a tollbooth collector, and spends the remainder of his time living off of a $200,000 reward he collected from an auto accident. All told, the life suits him just fine. However, as his old buddies start getting married and drifting away, Sonny realizes that if he doesn't do something soon, he could end up all alone for the rest of his life. When his most recent girlfriend, Vanessa (Kristy Swanson), indicates that she needs some time off because she's sick of being with a man who can't act like a grown-up, he decides that it's time to take drastic action to win her back. Conveniently enough, a little boy named Julian (Cole Sprouse and Dylan Sprouse) turns up on his doorstep, claiming that he's the biological son of Sonny's roommate and friend from law school, Kevin (Jon Stewart). The kid tells Sonny that he's from Buffalo, New York; Kevin has never been to Buffalo, New York, but no matter - Sonny foresees, in Julian, an opportunity to convince Vanessa that he can face adult responsibilities. He thus takes charge of the little boy over a long Columbus Day weekend, pretending to be Kevin. However, the plan doesn't work as expected, and the authorities hone in on a discovery of Sonny's real identity. Meanwhile, Sonny finds himself genuinely drawn to the tyke. Also supporting Sandler in Big Daddy are Joey Lauren Adams, Josh Mostel and Rob Schneider(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Boobs in Arms. World War II was just heating up, but the U.S. hadn't yet entered the fighting when the Three Stooges made this comic short. It opens with the boys selling greeting cards on the street, none too successfully. One surly guy in particular is a victim of the Stooges' harassment. To get away from his wrath, the boys dash into an apartment building, where they find a weepy young woman who thinks her husband doesn't love her anymore. To help her out, the Stooges offer to try to make her husband jealous. The woman's spouse turns out to be the very same man they harassed a few minutes earlier. To get away from him -- again -- the guys get in what they think is a bread line, but it's really a recruitment line for the Army. In a flash the Stooges are in uniform -- only to discover that their sergeant is the very same angry husband. They manage to make it through basic training and are sleeping through bomb blasts when they're woken up and sent on a mission. The sergeant has been captured and they're supposed to bomb enemy headquarters with laughing gas. Naturally, the gas shell explodes on them and they're captured. At the enemy headquarters, they manage to knock everyone unconscious while laughing uncontrollably. The place is being shelled by the American troops, and the Stooges, still laughing, ride one of the shells as it soars out of the building(n)</desc>

Princess Giselle (Amy Adams) lives in the blissful cartoon world of Andalasia, where magical beings frolic freely and musical interludes punctuate every interaction. Though Princess Giselle is currently engaged to be married to the handsome Prince Edward (James Marsden), her fate takes a turn for the worse when the villainous Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon) banishes her to the unforgiving metropolis of New York City. As the cruelty of the big city soon begins to wear down the fairy-tale exterior of the once-carefree princess, the frightened Giselle soon finds herself falling for a friendly but flawed divorce lawyer (Patrick Dempsey) whose kind compassion helps her to survive in this strange and dangerous new world(n)</desc>

USA Today journalist Ike Graham uses her as an example for a female-bashing piece, only for Carpenter to angrily reply that she only jilted three men, and that's just one of 15 inaccuracies in his piece. Stung by the rebuke, Graham travels to Carpenter's small home town to get the story directly from her. But when the pair meet, it's apparent wedding bells might soon be ringing again...

    <title lang="en">Proof of Life</title>
    <desc lang="en">A woman whose marriage is in trouble finds herself falling for a new man as her husband's life hangs in the balance in this thriller. Peter Bowman (David Morse) and his wife Alice (Meg Ryan) have relocated to a small Latin American nation called Tecala; Peter works for an American engineering and construction firm, and his latest assignment has him building a dam that is intended to bring power to the developing nation. The ELT is a radical Marxist faction gearing up for political revolution in Tecala that has turned to kidnapping as a way to raise capital, and Peter is chosen as its next target. When Peter is ambushed on his way to work, his firm brings in Terry Thorn (Russell Crowe), a former Australian intelligence operative who now works as a private "kidnapping and ransom" negotiator. Alice is told Terry is her best hope for bringing Peter back safe and sound, but when Terry's employers run into a tight squeeze financially, they cancel their K&amp;R insurance (which is considered a standard benefit for American employees assigned to South America), leaving Alice to rehire Terry on her own, especially since she can't possibly pay the $3 million ransom demanded by the kidnappers. As Terry and his partner Dino (David Caruso) map out a rescue plan, Alice and Terry find themselves increasingly attracted to each other. Alice's marriage to Peter was going through a rough patch when he was kidnapped, and while she's deeply concerned for his safety, she must reconcile her fears for Peter's life with her new feelings for Terry. Proof of Life is based on Adventures in the Ransom Trade , an article by journalist William Prochnau that was published in Vanity Fair, as well as on the case of real-life kidnapping victim Tom Hargrove(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">American Sniper</title>
    <desc lang="en">Biopic of Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper), the most-celebrated sniper in American military history. In the aftermath of 9/11, Kyle decides to serve his country by becoming a Navy SEAL. But with each tour of duty, he grows more detached from his wife and children. As the story opens, we meet carefree brothers Chris and Jeff (Keir O'Donnell) as they work the Texas rodeo circuit. They're cowboys through and through, and despite being notably older than the usual enlistee, Chris pays a visit to his local recruitment office and decides to become a Navy SEAL. Later, at the firing range, he draws on his hunting lessons with his stern father to become an expert marksman. A booze-fueled barroom chat with pretty brunette Taya (Sienna Miller) soon leads to wedding bells, and following the terrorist attacks of 9/11, Kyle is deployed to Iraq for his first tour of duty. There, his reputation as a sniper who never misses makes him a legend among his fellow troops, and earns him the moniker "The Devil of Ramadi" from his enemies. With a substantial bounty on his head, Kyle makes it his personal mission to take out a sadistic Iraqi soldier known as "The Butcher," as well as an elusive enemy marksman with a skill to rival his own. The closer he gets to achieving his goals during repeat tours of duty, however, the more fellow soldiers he sees die, and the further he drifts from Taya and their two children back home. It all leads up to a tense rooftop gunfight in a raging sandstorm -- one that convinces the sniper once and for all to make his family his top priority. Unfortunately, all is not well as Kyle struggles to make the transition back to civilian life, but he discovers that helping his fellow veterans is an effective way to do good and make peace with his wartime experiences(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Closed Circuit</title>
    <desc lang="en">Boy A director John Crowley teams with Dirty Pretty Things screenwriter Steven Knight for this topical thriller starring Eric Bana and Rebecca Hall star as two former lovers who encounter danger when they are both assigned to the same defense team in a high-profile terrorism trial. It was a typical morning in London when a powerful bomb exploded in the heart of the city. After the smoke cleared, sole surviving terrorist cell member Farroukh Erdogan (Denis Moschitto) was quickly taken into custody. As preparations for his trial begin, however, the government's plan to use classified evidence to prosecute the suspect leads the Attorney General (Jim Broadbent) to appoint Special Advocate Claudia Simmons-Howe (Hall) to the case. Claudia's unique position as a government-approved defense lawyer ensures that she can review the top-secret evidence, and advocate for full disclosure during the inevitable "closed" session portion of the trial. Once Claudia has reviewed the evidence, however, any communication with the defense team and the defendant himself is strictly forbidden. Later, When Erdogan's lawyer dies just before the trial begins, Claudia's driven ex-lover, attorney Martin Rose (Bana), takes his place. Realizing that their previous affair could jeopardize their involvement with the case, Claudia and Martin vow to keep the relationship a well-guarded secret. In time, however, Martin's exhaustive investigation reveals evidence of a shocking conspiracy that threatens to consume them both. Ciarán Hinds and Julia Stiles also star(n)</desc>

While these writers stand on the shoulders of giants such as Agatha Christie, Ruth Rendell and PD James, their dark imaginings are more likely to have been nurtured at newsroom crime desks, in mortuaries, piecing bones of murder victims back together, and in the bedrooms of modern marriages.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">DIY SOS highlights the plight of nation's 250,000 young carers, who look after their parents on a daily basis. Blackpool Carers Trust, which is supported by funding from Children in Need, provides limited out-of-school respite and training activities for some of these carers - but its current centre is bursting at the seams. It has now inherited a run-down property, which is bigger but will require the renovation of a neglected building and a huge overgrown garden - and that's where Nick and the team come in, with help from designer Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen.(n)</desc>

This is demonstrated by the emperor tamarin males conned into childcare in Peru and the South African vervet monkeys that have a sophisticated alarm system to protect them from predators. But living together often has its problems, like the Barbary macaques in Gibraltar who have their babies stolen by others out to impress their boss, the matriarchal ring-tailed lemur societies where females battle one another with their children in tow, and the hamadryas baboons of Ethiopia where the males rule with an iron fist.(n)</desc>

Back in Britain, George meets a man turning a wrecked private jet into a crash pad and a Gypsy tattoo artist with big plans for an old railway carriage. George also challenges his pal, craftsman Will Hardie, to create a woodland retreat for less than the price of a family holiday.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Prehistoric Ice Man. South Park caps its second season with an episode titled "Prehistoric Ice Man." When Kenny, Kyle, Stan, and Eric stumble across a man frozen in a block of ice, mad scientist Mephisto assures them that the man dates back to 1996. As the boys fight for credit over the discovery, the now unfrozen man is put on display in Mephisto's lab. Dance band Ace of Base and crocodile hunter Steve Irwin are just a pair of the pop culture figures satirized in this typically irreverent episode of South Park. "Prehistoric Ice Man" originally aired January 20, 1999, on Comedy Central(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Mean Girls</title>
    <desc lang="en">Tina Fey from Saturday Night Live wrote and appears in this comedy about the alternately funny and terrifying pecking order among teenage girls. Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan) is a 15-year-old girl who has spent most of her life in Africa, where she was home-schooled by her zoologist parents. When her family relocates to the United States, Cady finds herself attending a high school in suburban Illinois, where she gets a crash course in the various sub-strata of the student body: the jocks, the cheerleaders, the stoners, the "cool" kids, and so on. Much to her surprise, Cady finds herself embraced by a clique of rich and popular girls known to outsiders as "the Plastics," led by Regina George (Rachel McAdams), Gretchen Weiners (Lacey Chabert), and Karen Smith (Amanda Seyfried). While Cady is grateful for her new friends, it doesn't take long for her to realize how manipulative they can be, and she soon discovers she's violated an unwritten law when she goes out on a date with Aaron (Jonathan Bennett), who is charming, good looking...and Regina's former boyfriend. It isn't long before Regina and her pals are on the warpath, and Cady must face a level of vengeful behavior for which years in the jungle never prepared her. Joining Tina Fey in the supporting cast are fellow SNL players Amy Poehler, Ana Gasteyer, and Tim Meadows. The screenplay for Mean Girls was based in part on Queen Bees and Wannabes: Helping Your Daughter Survive Cliques, Gossip, Boyfriends and Other Realities of Adolescence, a book by professional youth counselor Rosalind Wiseman(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">A Very Brady Sequel</title>
    <desc lang="en">Like its lively predecessor, The Brady Bunch Movie (1995), this mild comic send-up takes its characters and situations from the popular family sitcom of the 1970s, The Brady Bunch. Set in the '90s, it is filled with in-joke references to American pop culture. However, one need not be familiar with the original series in order to enjoy this film. Bad guy Trevor Thomas (Tim Matheson) is posing as supermom Carol Brady's long-dead first husband Roy Martin. He claims to have been amnesiac and made unrecognizable by plastic surgery after suffering disfiguring injuries, but in truth, he is on the hunt for a very valuable artifact, an ancient Chinese horse carving which Roy sent to his family from the field. Because of the family's sheer niceness, they could never imagine such deception, and husband Mike Brady (Gary Cole) welcomes him into their midst. This causes Roy no end of frustration, as not only must he live with this incredibly sweet and cheerful family while he searches for the carving, but he must endure having his ill-tempered sarcastic jibes go completely unrecognized. When Carol (Shelley Long) is kidnapped, the whole family goes a-hunting(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">McGee deals with his father's recent death by writing him a letter outlining the details of his latest investigation. The case involved tracking down a hactivist collective known as Krampus, who were thought to have been responsible for an incident in which the internet crashed all over Washington, DC. McGee and Abby brought in three known cyber-terrorists for questioning, and discover evidence that links the trio to an attempted breach of the Congress email server and archive. However, when this line of inquiry reaches a dead-end, the team picks up a new lead that suggests an isolated hacker from Wisconsin may be responsible. This `lone wolf' scenario does not seem plausible to McGee, though, as he recalls a lesson his late dad taught him. Crime drama, starring Sean Murray.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This daily show-biz gossip and "expose" series was a spinoff of the popular interactive website TMZ, an acronym for the "Thirty Mile Zone" surrounding Hollywood. Created in 2005, TMZ had gained national prominence by breaking the story of Mel Gibson's anti-Semitic tirade after his arrest for drunken driving. By the time the TV version of TMZ premiered the week of September 10, 2007, the operation had once again scooped its scandal-rag competition with its coverage of O.J. Simpson's profanity-laden "invasion" of the home of a collectibles dealer who was allegedly selling Simpson memorabilia without permission. In fact, TMZ on TV had a wealth of celebrity-meltdown yarns to choose from during its shakedown week, ranging from the substance-abuse problems of Lindsay Lohan to the ill-fated "comeback" concert of Britney Spears. Harvey Levin, managing editor for both versions of TMZ, appeared on-camera as a correspondent, along with Sean Borg, Michael Hundgen, Katie Darryl and Teresa Strasser. TMZ on TV was seen primarily on local Fox or Fox-owned affiliates throughout the U.S(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This daily show-biz gossip and "expose" series was a spinoff of the popular interactive website TMZ, an acronym for the "Thirty Mile Zone" surrounding Hollywood. Created in 2005, TMZ had gained national prominence by breaking the story of Mel Gibson's anti-Semitic tirade after his arrest for drunken driving. By the time the TV version of TMZ premiered the week of September 10, 2007, the operation had once again scooped its scandal-rag competition with its coverage of O.J. Simpson's profanity-laden "invasion" of the home of a collectibles dealer who was allegedly selling Simpson memorabilia without permission. In fact, TMZ on TV had a wealth of celebrity-meltdown yarns to choose from during its shakedown week, ranging from the substance-abuse problems of Lindsay Lohan to the ill-fated "comeback" concert of Britney Spears. Harvey Levin, managing editor for both versions of TMZ, appeared on-camera as a correspondent, along with Sean Borg, Michael Hundgen, Katie Darryl and Teresa Strasser.

When a crazed sniper guns down five seemingly random people on a crowded Pittsburgh riverfront, Det. Emerson (David Oyelowo) quickly amasses enough evidence at the scene to implicate an unstable ex-military sniper named James Barr (Joseph Sikora). Upon being questioned by Emerson and DA Alex Rodin (Richard Jenkins), however, Barr demands to speak with Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise). A former military investigator who fell off the grid following his service, Reacher soon shows up on the scene and begins gathering clues with the aid of talented defense attorney Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike), the daughter of the DA. Meanwhile, when Reacher is assaulted in a local bar, he correctly surmises that someone is determined to impede his investigation. His theory plays out when he becomes the prime suspect in the murder of a young woman shortly thereafter. Now, with the police closing in from one side and a gang of ruthless killers gaining ground on the other, Reacher must use his formidable detective skills in order to catch the gunman and uncover his true motives(n)</desc>

Bartender Moe Szyslak (voice of Hank Azaria) has never had much luck with the ladies, but after four years without a date, his pal Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) takes him out to a local disco in hopes of meeting eligible women. The night at the club is bust, but afterwards Moe passes a flower cart owned by Renee (voice of Helen Hunt); they strike up a conversation and she's taken with his "insecure, sweaty charm." Moe and Renee start dating, and he doesn't hesitate to spend big when they go out, but once his credit card is maxed out, Moe is afraid Renee will lose interest in him. Needing some quick cash, Moe hatches a crackpot scheme in which Homer will "steal" his car while he and Renee are out for the evening, and the insurance settlement will allow him to keep wining and dining his sweetheart. However, rather than park the car on a railroad track as planned, Homer stops at a drive-in showing Hail To The Chimp, and by the end of the evening he's been arrested for Grand Theft Auto. At first, Moe promises to vouch for Homer, but afraid Renee will think less of him, he lets his best friend rot in jail rather than tell the truth. "Dumbbell Indemnity was first aired on March 1, 1998(n)</desc>

In a rare burst of self-improvement, Homer joins a gym, and discovers Teutonic action hero Rainier Wolfcastle (voice of Harry Shearer) works out there on a regular basis. Wolfcastle becomes Homer's training partner, and Homer follows his lead in wolfing down Powersauce bars, energy snacks made from applesauce. Homer actually loses a few pounds and gains some impressive arm muscles after a few month at the gym, and he's approached by Brad (voice of Brendan Frasier) and Neil (voice of Steven Weber), two marketing men with Powersauce's corporate headquarters. Brad and Neil persuade Homer to climb the Murderhorn, Springfield's tallest mountain, as a publicity stunt to promote Powersauce, and Homer agrees, despite the panicky objections of Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) and Grandpa (also voiced by Dan Castellaneta). To insure Homer's safety, Brad and Neil arrange for a pair of sherpas to tag along and do the hard work, but when Homer sends them home to prove he can scale the summit on his own, everyone is convinced he's done for.

    <sub-title lang="en">Homer to the Max</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Homer to the Max. Television devotee Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) is settling in for an exciting evening of new mid-season replacement shows when he watches the premiere of an action drama called Police Cops and is pleased to discover the suave and fearless lead detective is named Homer Simpson. The coincidence gives Homer a boost in self-esteem until he sees the second episode, in which the Homer Simpson character has been reworked into a half-bright bumbling oaf. Homer appeals to the producers of Police Cops , who refuse to reconsider the character's new direction, so Homer changes his name to Max Power. Homer adopts a new personality to go along with the new name, and energetic and ambitious Max Power makes friends with Trent Steel (voice of Hank Azaria), a member of Springfield's moneyed elite. Homer and his wife Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) enjoy traveling in new, posh circles and meeting the town's most important people, but when his new pals want him to take part in a protest to protect a forest scheduled to be clear cut, Homer isn't so sure he feels like being arrested for his new friends' principles. Featuring a voice cameo from actor and environmental activist Ed Begley Jr. (who recites the classic line "It's a go-cart powered by my own sense of self-satisfaction"), "Homer To The Max" first aired on February 7, 1999(n)</desc>

Given his short and undistinguished career in academia, Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) is surprised when he's invited to a ritzy social function at Springfield University, though Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) correctly guesses that he's been lured to a fund-raising event. Reunited with his pals Benjamin (voice of Harry Shearer), Doug (voice of Hank Azaria) and Gary (also voiced by Castellaneta), Homer decides they should play a prank on the Dean, which predictably backfires as Homer ends up with a bucket of Super Glue stuck to his head. Homer isn't able remove the bucket until he and his family attend a tent revival meeting led by traveling preacher Brother Faith (voice of Don Cheadle). Brother Faith claims he can channel his spiritual power through Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright), and the boy is able to remove the bucket; certain he has the gift of healing, Bart sets up his own revival, but realizes he has no special powers when his attempt to cure Milhouse (voice of Pamela Hayden) of his near-sightedness causes his friend to be hit by a car. Homer, however, still believes Bart can heal the sick, and when Springfield U's star kicker hurts his leg during the big game, he volunteers his son to mend the injury; as it happens, more than Springfield's pride is on the line when Bart learns local Mafiosi Fat Tony (voice of Joe Mantegna) has a lot of money riding on the game.

Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) takes his kids Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright) and Lisa (voice of Yeardley Smith) to an animation festival, where he sees a demonstration of Animotion, a new process that can turn human movement into character animation on screen. Certain this is the wave of the future, Homer invests the all the family's savings in Animotion, Inc., without Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) knowing about it. Animotion quickly goes belly-up, leaving the Simpsons penniless, and Homer begins submitting to medical experiments to earn extra money. The doctors using Homer as a guinea pig make the startling discovery that he has several crayons lodged in his brain, which he shoved up his nose as a boy; removing the wax markers causes Homer's unimpressive IQ to rise to genius level. While Lisa is delighted to have another intellectual in the household at last, Homer's friends and co-workers aren't especially happy with the newer, brighter man, and it puts his job as safety monitor at Springfield's nuclear power plant in serious jeopardy. "Homr" was first aired on January 7, 2001(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Legend of Bagger Vance</title>
    <desc lang="en">Robert Redford directed this adaptation of a novel by Steven Pressfield that uses golf as a metaphor for one man's spiritual and philosophical journeys. Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon) was a gifted amateur golfer from Savannah, GA, until traumatic experiences during World War I shattered his confidence and sent him into a spiral of alcoholism. In 1931, Adele Invergordon (Charlize Theron), a beautiful heiress who once loved Junuh, inherits a spectacular but financially ailing golf course after the suicide of her father. To attract customers, she proposed a high-stakes match between the two most famous golfers of the day, Bobby Jones (Joel Gretsch) and Walter Hagen (Bruce McGill). Local businessmen sponsoring the match insist that a local golfer be added to the card, and Junuh is drafted for the position, but it soon becomes obvious that his game is just a shadow of its former glory. When things seem hopeless, a mysterious gentleman named Bagger Vance (Will Smith) volunteers to serve as Junuh's caddy and coach, using a mixture of ancient wisdom and past-life knowledge to help Junah "remember" the swing he's lost. Jack Lemmon narrates the story, and J. Michael Moncrief plays Lemmon's character as a boy(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Stargate saga continues as an elite military unit races back to Earth following the mysterious disappearance of two key team members, only to find themselves in an alternate reality where the Stargate has never been invented. Somewhere in deep space, the SG-1 team is in serious trouble. Two team members have vanished without a trace, and now the SG-1 unit's only hope for survival is to get back to Earth as quickly as possible. Upon touching down the team is relieved to be home, but deeply disturbed to learn that the reality they just returned to isn't the same one they departed from. In this reality, the Stargate has never been discovered and neither the government nor the military has never even heard of the SG-1 unit. But who altered the Earth's timeline, and why? Upon discovering that a malevolent alien known as Ba'al has been meddling with the planet's timeline in an attempt to conquer Earth, the team must race against time to defeat the most powerful adversary that they have ever faced(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Coraline</title>
    <desc lang="en">(2009) Director Henry Selick (The Nightmare Before Christmas; James and the Giant Peach) delivers a deliciously dark stop-motion animated adventure, based on Neil Gaiman's much-praised book. Coraline Jones (voiced by Dakota Fanning) and her parents move into the Pink Palaces Apartments in Oregon, where they find themselves surrounded by eccentric neighbours, including a pair of ageing burlesque performers (Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French). It should be an exciting time, but Coraline's parents (Teri Hatcher and John Hodgman) are too busy working to spend any time with her, so she is deeply bored. That is until she discovers a mysterious door that only appears after dark. Bold and inquisitive, the youngster investigates. She discovers a brightly coloured alternative universe, where her 'Other Mother' (also Hatcher) has plenty of time to play with her and her neighbours' quirks are charmingly exaggerated. But all is not as it seems: everyone in the new world has buttons for eyes - and the operation to install them involves knitting needles. And that revelation is just the first of her shocking discoveries about the true nature of her apparent idyll... So, there's good reason for the film's PG certificate, although children who can cope with Hansel and Gretel shouldn't find anything too disturbing here. Selick's film won great critical acclaim, scooped festival prizes around the world, picked up an Oscar nomination and won the 2009 Bafta Children's Award(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Coraline</title>
    <desc lang="en">(2009) Director Henry Selick (The Nightmare Before Christmas; James and the Giant Peach) delivers a deliciously dark stop-motion animated adventure, based on Neil Gaiman's much-praised book. Coraline Jones (voiced by Dakota Fanning) and her parents move into the Pink Palaces Apartments in Oregon, where they find themselves surrounded by eccentric neighbours, including a pair of ageing burlesque performers (Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French). It should be an exciting time, but Coraline's parents (Teri Hatcher and John Hodgman) are too busy working to spend any time with her, so she is deeply bored. That is until she discovers a mysterious door that only appears after dark. Bold and inquisitive, the youngster investigates. She discovers a brightly coloured alternative universe, where her 'Other Mother' (also Hatcher) has plenty of time to play with her and her neighbours' quirks are charmingly exaggerated. But all is not as it seems: everyone in the new world has buttons for eyes - and the operation to install them involves knitting needles. And that revelation is just the first of her shocking discoveries about the true nature of her apparent idyll... So, there's good reason for the film's PG certificate, although children who can cope with Hansel and Gretel shouldn't find anything too disturbing here. Selick's film won great critical acclaim, scooped festival prizes around the world, picked up an Oscar nomination and won the 2009 Bafta Children's Award(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Swimfan</title>
    <desc lang="en">A moment of temptation leads to a high body count and untold regrets for a high-school swimming star in this thriller starring Bring It On's Jesse Bradford and Traffic's Erika Christensen. Despite a shady past involving drugs and the juvenile justice system, Ben Cronin (Bradford) seems to have it all: a loving mother, a devoted girlfriend (Shiri Appleby), and a shot at a college scholarship in California. But the same week that athletic scouts will be deciding his future, Ben finds himself embroiled in a flirtation with Madison Bell (Christensen), a bewitching transfer student who seduces him into supposedly strings-free sex during an impromptu swim lesson after hours in the school pool. When Ben takes Madison at her word and goes about his business as if nothing had happened, she insinuates herself into his life with sinister glee. Showing up at Ben's house, befriending his girlfriend, and sending him naked pictures -- none of her strategies wins his heart. So Madison turns to other, more devious forms of courtship. Soon, Ben finds himself kicked off the swim team for supposed steroid use, suspected of murdering a rival (Clayne Crawford), and rejected by his girlfriend for his sexual indiscretions. Eventually, though, he receives help in uncovering the genesis of Madison's uncanny fixation from an unexpected source. Originally titled "Swimfan85" (after Madison's Internet screen name), the retitled Swimfan hit the top spot at the back-to-school box office when it was released September 6, 2002. Dan Hedaya co-stars as Ben's stern but loving mentor, Coach Simkins. Actor-turned-director John Polson previously helmed Siam Sunset(n)</desc>

Josh (Josh Kornbluth) is an overstuffed aspiring writer who is trying to finish his first novel, but in the meantime he supports himself by working as an office temp. Josh has grown accustomed to the Byzantine world of temporary labor, particularly the bossy secretaries and chilly co-workers, but Josh manages to impress his latest employers enough that they offer to make him a permanent, full-time employee. While a fellow temp who worked for the same company warns Josh that taking the job would be a mistake, Josh takes the plunge anyway, and soon discovers that his fellow employees now embrace him as one of their own. He also discovers that Bob Shelby (Warren Keith), his new boss, is more than a little crazy, and when Bob gives Josh an assignment to mail a series of important letters, John finds that he's suddenly incapable of doing this seemingly simple task. Instead, Josh spends his days working on his book (on company time and on a company computer), with his fellow office drones offering emphatic encouragement. Josh Kornbluth adapted Haiku Tunnel (with the help of John Bellucci and Jacob Kornbluth) from a semi-improvised one-man show Kornbluth created with David Ford; the Kornbluth brothers also directed the film(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The title character in this made-for-cable comedy is a youthful slacker (Nick Stabile) who has long been a source of disappointment and embarrassment for his famous jolly-old-elf father. Anxious to prove his worth, Nick (as our hero is known) decides to clamber down a few chimneys just prior to Christmas Eve. Alas, his efforts coincide with a string of burglaries, and Nick is promptly arrested by cops Daryl Bedford (Judd Nelson) and Norm Potter (George Wallace). As Nick frets away the hours before Christmas under house arrest, Bedford grows attached to Nick's court-appointed attorney, Susan Flynn (Lauren Holly) -- and inevitably, the real burglar strikes again. Santa Jr. was first telecast over the Hallmark Channel on November 30, 2002(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">An embittered family man finds his childhood love of Christmas rekindled thanks to a generous gift from a mysterious stranger in this holiday drama for the entire family. Three decades after a childhood tragedy that destroyed his love of Christmas, cynical Michael Walker still loathes the sound of carols, and the sight of Old St. Nick. Try as his spirited wife (Connie Britton) and family might, they still can't get Michael into the holiday spirit. Meanwhile, as the snow begins to fall, misfortune strikes Michael's family, prompting the concerned father to reflect on his troubled past. Just when Michael's future looks to be teetering on the brink of disaster, however, a benevolent stranger (Willie Nelson) bestows his family a lavish new home under the one condition that they join in their new neighborhood's Christmas festivities. In the process, the man who forgot how to feel joy rediscovers that wide-eyed child who ran down the stairs every Christmas morning eager to see what Santa had left him under the tree. Kris Kristoferson and Lyle Lovett co-star(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">A Hard Day's Night (Pilot)</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">A Hard Day's Night (Pilot). It's a grueling and eventful first 48 hours for the new crop of surgical interns at Seattle Grace Hospital in the debut episode of Grey's Anatomy. Among the newcomers are Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), still struggling to emerge from the shadow of her celebrated surgeon mother Ellis Grey (Kate Burton); fiercely competitive Stanford grad Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), who will in time become Meredith's best friend; former fashion model Isobel "Izzie" Stevens (Katherine Heigl), a bit put off that she's no longer the sole center of attention; amiable, naïve George O'Malley (T.R. Knight); and Alex Karev (Justin Chambers), who wastes no time proving himself to be a pompous jerk. After a pep talk from chief surgeon Richard Webber (James Pickens Jr.), the interns are placed in the not-so-tender care of supervising doctor Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson), also known as "The Nazi" for reasons that become instantly obvious. During their two-day shakedown cruise, the rookies come face to face with the harsh realities of hospital life, with Meredith tending to a girl suffering from seizures, George enduring his first appendectomy, and Cristina finds that it's no picnic workiing under veteran surgeon Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington). But the biggest shock of all is reserved for Ellis, when she discovers that her handsome "one-night stand" from the previous evening happens to be her new boss, Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey)! Peter Horton received an Emmy nomination for his direction of this inaugural episode(n)</desc>

Among the casualties is a biker named Viper (Callum Blue), who has spokes protruding from his abdomen--not that this prevents him from hitting on Meredith (Ellen Pompeo), who has enough trouble on her hands fending off Derek (Patrick Dempsey). On a more somber note, anothere of the victims is an unidentified, brain-dead woman, whose organs may end up being harvested for a gay cancer patient (Keith David. It is up to Izzie (Katherine Heigl) to decide whether or not to remove the comatose woman's liver...and, more problematically, to determine how long to wait before doing so(n)</desc>

Domesticated from the time he was just a hatchling, Blu traded a life in the clouds for a contented existence in Moose Lake with his doting owner, Linda (Leslie Mann). They live under the impression that Blu is the last of his kind, but upon receiving word that a female macaw named Jewel (Anne Hathaway) has been discovered in Rio de Janeiro, Linda and Blu set their sights on South America on a mission to replenish the species. Shortly after their arrival in the Brazilian capitol, however, the two rare birds fall victim to a gang of greedy animal smugglers intent on making a mint by selling Blu and Jewel to the highest bidder. But the headstrong Jewel isn't about to be locked in a cage and put on display, so when the opportunity arises she stages a daring escape with the help of some wisecracking local birds, and takes her new friend Blu along for the ride. With the bumbling birdnappers fast closing in, Blu realizes that his only hope for making a clean getaway and reuniting with Linda is to finally summon the courage he needs to take flight. Rio also features the voices of Tracy Morgan, Jamie Foxx, George Lopez, and will.i.am(n)</desc>

For Collee it's all about getting her heroic boyfriend's guitar back to his family since he saved her life on the battlefield.

    <title lang="en">High Tension</title>
    <desc lang="en">French filmmaker Alexandre Aja writes and directs the slasher film Haute Tension, given the English title Switchblade Romance. Best friends Marie (Cécile De France) and Alex (Maïwenn Le Besco) go out to the countryside to visit Alex's parents. However, a homicidal delivery man (played by Philippe Nahon from Gaspar Noé's brutal movies) ends up at their house and starts killing everyone. Alex and Marie fight for their lives with help from several means of weaponry. Switchblade Romance was shown at the 2003 Toronto Film Festival as part of the Midnight program. The film was aquired by US distributor Lions Gate Films in 2004 and quickly put into turnaround as an NC-17 release, though plans for that were scrapped due to a lack of theater support of the controversial rating. Retitled High Tension, the R-rated version is missing one minute of grisly gore and features a redubbed audio track by star Cécile De France(n)</desc>

Shortly after earning his degree, Paul Dynan (Kevin Zegers) realizes the certificate in his hand is barely worth the paper it's printed on. Subsequently drowning in a sea of debt due to his student loans and his mother's medical bills, the disillusioned graduate hits a breaking point as the bank prepares to foreclose on his family home, and devises a plan to earn some quick cash while giving the rich a lesson in humility. His plan: abduct three privileged socialites with the help of two young deviants, and make their fathers (Ray Liotta, Victor Garber), and Stephen McHattie) fork over $3 million for their safe return. Unfortunately for Paul, the bitter infighting between his three affluent targets is about to blow the plan sky high, and offer a painful lesson in the perils of crime(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Three loosely interrelated stories of dysfunctional relationships are played for edgy laughs in this dark comedy drama from writer and director Don Roos. An unexpected assignation between stepsiblings Mamie and Charley results in Mamie becoming pregnant, with the child being put up for adoption shortly after birth. Twenty years later, Mamie (Lisa Kudrow) is approached by Nicky (Jesse Bradford), an aspiring filmmaker with an abrasive personality who claims to know where her long-lost son is living. However, there's a catch -- Nicky wants to shoot the reunion for the student film he's working on, and won't tell her about her child unless she agrees, though her lover, Javier (Bobby Cannavale), attempts to work out a compromise. Meanwhile, Charley (Steve Coogan), now out of the closet, has a longstanding relationship with Gil (David Sutcliffe), and the couple are involved in a legal battle over whether or not Gil's donated sperm produced a baby who has been adopted by a lesbian couple they know (Laura Dern and Sarah Clarke). And finally, Jude (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is a bohemian malcontent who becomes involved with Otis (Jason Ritter), a sexually ambiguous rock musician. Otis has a difficult relationship with his father, Frank (Tom Arnold), but when Jude meets Frank, she likes him fine -- in fact, she soon falls in love with him and leaves Otis for his dad. Happy Endings had its world premiere at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival(n)</desc>

Alex Stillman (Bret Harrison) is a Yale senior with a knack for Texas Hold 'Em. But while Alex dreams of the day he'll be able to dominate the tables out in Las Vegas, he hasn't mastered the art of the cards just yet. Alex's luck begins to change, however, after a chance encounter with legendary poker player Tommy Vinson (Burt Reynolds). Tommy gave up gambling 20 years ago in hopes that he could save his family. He recognizes the potential in Alex, and he's beginning to regain his confidence after two decades of maintaining a low profile. Alex agrees to become Tommy's protégé, and together the pair wins every tournament they enter. But Alex's attraction to beautiful Las Vegas call girl Michelle (Shannon Elizabeth) has caused his attention shift away from the tables, and that distraction has opened up a deep chasm between the emerging talent and the undisputed master. Later, after Alex and Tommy call off their partnership, they find themselves on opposite sides of the table at the prestigious World Poker Tour. Who will take the top prize? Will it be the old pro who promised he would never gamble again or the newcomer who learned all of his tricks from the true master of the trade?(n)</desc>

En route to their new jobs, the men come across the handiwork of a lynch mob. Later, they find hospitality at the home of Blind Dick (Harry Dean Stanton), who graciously provides them with food and shelter. The cowboys are unaware that Blind Dick and his men recently robbed a stagecoach and murdered the driver. A sheriff (Bradon Carroll) and his posse surround the cabin and hang the thieves. Though innocent, the terrified cowboys flee. Otis is killed, but Wes and Vern escape -- with the posse in pursuit. When they stop to rest at the ranch of Evan (George Mitchell), Wes considers taking Evan's daughter hostage. Trying to steal Evan's horse, Vern is killed by the rancher, who in turn is shot by Wes. Once a law-abiding citizen, Wes has been transformed by unjust vigilantism into a killer. Fascinated by frontier era journals that he discovered in an L.A. library, Nicholson used the documents as inspiration in writing the script(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">As World War I rages in Europe and Allied forces in France, Italy, and England find their resolve quickly diminishing due to the overwhelming force of the German juggernaut, a handful of brave American soldiers volunteer to join their French counterparts in learning to fly and fighting for freedom from above as the true story of the legendary Lafayette Escadrille comes to the screen in a breathtaking war adventure from Academy Award-winning director Tony Bill and famed producer Dean Devlin. They have come from all over the United States, ready and willing to put their lives on the line despite their country's initial pledge to not get involved with the all-consuming war that rages throughout Europe. Few could have foreseen the challenges faced by the world's first fighter pilots, however, and upon arriving at their aerodrome in France, the aspiring aviators are assigned to a new squadron under the command of war-ravaged Captain Thenault (Jean Reno) and battle-weary American pilot Reed Cassidy -- the sole survivor of his devastated former air brigade. With little encouragement from their fellow aviators and nothing to drive but their unifying goal of taking to the skies and offering up their lives in the name of freedom, the determined airmen of the Lafayette Escadrille set out to make history by embarking on the adventure of a lifetime. James Franco, Martin Henderson, and David Ellison star in a script penned by Phil Sears, Blake T. Evans, and David S. Ward(n)</desc>

In no time Adam is climbing the corporate ladder straight to the top. No one suspects a thing, and Wyatt is gaining a distinct advantage over the competition.

    <desc lang="en">Featuring sly tributes to horror fantasies of the past and infused with gallows humor, Sam Raimi's final entry in the Evil Dead trilogy features the largest budget and most lavish special effects. Once again the story centers on the attempts of Ash, a modern Yankee to escape the dark, mystical confines of medieval England where he found himself after suffering a car accident. This and his subsequent adventures are explained in the film's prologue. According to his friend Wiseman, Ash cannot return home until he can retrieve the Necronomicon, a book that contains the spell necessary to raise the dead or vanquish existing zombies. The book is located in a magical graveyard. Ash is heading there when the demonic entities who bedeviled him in the previous installments pursue him to a malevolent windmill. There a mirror shatters and Ash finds himself surrounded by a legion of tiny clones of himself. One of the ornery dopplegangers crawls into his mouth and transforms into his wicked twin. A battle begins and the Good Ash triumphs. Eventually, he makes it to the graveyard. In order to get the book, Ash must correctly recite a memorized spell. Unfortunately, he has forgotten a few key words and in saying it causes a legion of corpses to rise from the graves. This hellish army is led by his own dead double and that is when all the gooey, gory fun really begins(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Killer Joe</title>
    <desc lang="en">A desperate Texas drug dealer plots to settle a sizable debt by killing his mother and collecting the insurance money, but gets into an even bigger mess after hiring a twisted police detective who moonlights as a killer-for-hire to get the job done. Chris (Emile Hirsch) is in serious trouble. He's just incurred a major debt to Digger Soames (Marc Macaulay), and when you're late paying Digger, you can wind up dead. His back against the wall, Chris comes to his father Ansel (Thomas Haden Church) with a sinister proposition: they'll hire a killer to get rid of Chris' mother (and Ansel's ex-wife), then collect the insurance money that will go to Chris' teenage sister Dottie (Juno Temple), a seraphic sleepwalker who seems to exist in a world all her own. Bringing Chris' temperamental stepmother Sharla (Gina Gershon) in on the hustle, the young deadbeat and his dimwitted father enlist the services of Joe Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a local police detective whose authority and detailed knowledge of police procedures make him the perfect hired killer. But Joe doesn't come cheap, and when his fee proves bigger than expected, Chris and Ansel agree to let him have Dottie as a "retainer" until the insurance check clears. Just when it starts to look as if everything is going according to plan, however, an unexpected complication plunges the entire situation into total chaos. A lurid black comedy that goes to some very dark places, Killer Joe is the second collaboration between acclaimed director William Friedkin and playwright/screenwriter Tracy Letts, who previously worked together on the 2006 psychological thriller Bug(n)</desc>

Graduating senior Nick Powell (Justin Chatwin) has plans to attend a prestigious writing workshop in London, despite the protests of his widowed mother (Marcia Gay Harden). In the days before his departure, he gets into a cafeteria brawl with a delinquent classmate, Annie Newton (Margarita Levieva), while defending his friend from her extortion attempts. Annie and her crew track Nick down on the night he's planning to leave, mistakenly thinking he ratted her out to the police regarding a smash-and-grab burglary committed the night before. When the subsequent beating goes too far, the assailants dump the body in the woods in a panicked attempt to dispose of it. Only, Nick isn't dead -- he's walking invisible among his classmates, friends, and family, desperately trying to alert them that he's still alive. Robbed of the traditional forms of communication, Nick must figure out supernatural methods of manipulating his environment -- and he soon realizes the very girl who attacked him may be the only one who has the power to save him(n)</desc>

After their first heist, a bizarrely-executed robbery of a local bookstore, the trio goes on the lam, taking up residence in a border hotel where Anthony falls in love with a maid played by Lumi Cavazos. When the three buddies decide that they need to return to the real world, they hook up with a master con-man (James Caan) who sends them on a daring -- if ill-concieved -- mission(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">First Sunday</title>
    <desc lang="en">Gospel-minded playwright David E. Talbert produces, writes, and directs this urban crime comedy concerning a pair of criminals who take a group of church parishioners hostage while attempting to rob the holy house, only to find their captives slowly convincing them to repent and give up their lawless lifestyles. Durell (Ice Cube) and LeeJohn (Tracy Morgan) are two best friends with a special knack for petty crime. Upset at discovering that his ex-girlfriend is planning to move out of state with the couple's young son, Durell knows that the only way to keep his fractured family in close proximity to one another is to raise the 17,000 dollars needed to pay off her growing debt. In order to get the money before his ex decides to make the big move, the desperate Durell enlists the aid of his scheming best buddy to rob their neighborhood church. But someone has beaten Durell and LeeJohn to the punch, and if they ever hope to get their hands on that quick cash, this bumbling pair will first have to spend an entire night in the presence of not just the almighty lord, but some of his most fervent followers as well. Katt Williams, Keith David, Regina Hall, and Chi Mcbride co-star(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Deep End of the Ocean</title>
    <desc lang="en">A drama that touches on the issues of the rights of adoptive vs. biological parents, and what is ultimately best for the child, The Deep End Of The Ocean stars Michelle Pfeiffer and Treat Williams as Beth and Pat Cappadora, working parents with three children. When Beth visits Chicago with the kids, she asks the oldest son to watch the youngest, three-year-old Ben, while she checks in to a hotel. When she returns a few minutes later, Ben has disappeared, nowhere to be found. Despite the best efforts of police detective Candy Bliss (Whoopi Goldberg), no trace of the boy can be discovered, and the loss has a profound effect on the family, especially Beth. Nine years later, a boy knocks on the Cappadoras' door, asking if they'd like him to mow their lawn. While Beth can hardly believe her first instinct, she soon discovers it's true -- the boy cutting the grass is actually Ben, who has been living with another family since his disappearance. While Ben is returned to the Cappadoras, the reunion isn't as blissful as everyone imagined at first; the family discovers Ben is in many ways a stranger to them, and Ben misses his adopted father, running away to be with him. Stephen Schiff based his screenplay on the 1996 novel by Jacquelyn Mitchard(n)</desc>

On arrival in the metropolis, he's befriended by Fender (Robin Williams), who acts as his guide to the town and its mores. Rodney quickly finds that even a society of robots isn't interested in the perfection he's offering, especially when the need for perpetual upgrades results in a constant flow of profits. But, with Fender's help and the love of Cappy (Halle Berry), he decides to confront the Big Weld and attempt to change society. M,W,R,S,HD(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Millions</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Danny Boyle revisits a theme from his Shallow Grave and Trainspotting days -- greed -- but focuses on a much younger protagonist with this comedy drama. Millions opens with recent widower Ronnie (James Nesbitt) moving his two precocious pre-pubescent sons to the suburbs. Missing his mother and the comforts of his old neighborhood, the young Damian (Alex Etel) builds a cardboard-box fort on the outskirts of the suburb, where one day his placid introvert existence is literally crushed by a giant gym bag full of thousands of pounds' worth of cash. Less concerned with the origin of the money than with how to spend it, Damian and his older brother, Anthony (Lewis McGibbon), decide to keep it a secret from their father, which becomes an increasingly tricky proposition as the days pass. His conscience getting in the way of his spending, Damian debates the ethics of his ill-gotten gains with a handful of imaginary saints, and begins to try to spend his cash a little more altruistically. But his charitable deeds inadvertently attract the attention of a mysterious, threatening man who's desperate to get his hands on the money. Marking a distinct change of pace for Boyle after the horror film 28 Days Later, Millions world-premiered at the 2004 Toronto Film Festival(n)</desc>

Out of earshot of Jenny's harridan guardian Mrs. Gann (Nancy Kulp), Old Ben confesses that he is a fugitive from a distant planet, an assertion that seems to be verified when he miraculously heals Jenny's leg. The arrival of two mysterious strangers leads to an even more startling revelation -- albeit one with happy results. Keep an eye on that photograph in the final scene.

    <title lang="en">Push</title>
    <desc lang="en">Lucky Number Slevin director Paul McGuigan takes the helm for this action thriller concerning a group of telekinetic American ex-patriots who band together in an attempt to take down the clandestine government agency that's genetically transforming normal citizens into powerful psychic warriors. The Division is a shadowy government operation devoted to making humankind the ultimate weapon. Those who accept this transformation have the power to move objects with the mind, see the future before it happens, create new realities, and dispense of their enemies without so much as a single touch; those who are unwilling to participate are immediately terminated. Nick Gant (Chris Evans) is a "mover," a second-generation telekinetic who went into hiding after the Division killed his father more than a decade earlier. He lives a life of anonymity in Hong Kong, a densely populated place where fugitive psychics such as himself are safe as long as they can keep their unique gift secret. Suddenly into Nick's life comes 13-year-old "watcher" Cassie Holmes (Dakota Fanning), a clairvoyant who needs his help in tracking down escaped "pusher" Kira, who may hold the key to bringing down the Division once and for all. A "pusher" is the most powerful kind of psychic due to his or her ability to influence the actions of others by planting thoughts in their minds. Now, as Nick emerges from hiding in order to help Cassie find Kira, the Division's human bloodhounds are hot on their trail. In order to elude the authorities, they'll need to disappear into the seedy underbelly of the city while relying on a team of rogue psychics to help cover their tracks. But Division Agent Henry Carver (Djimon Hounsou) is a powerful pusher who has made it his mission to stop them at all costs, regardless of the collateral damages that may occur in the process(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Little Girl Lost</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Little Girl Lost. Though it is often assumed that Twilight Zone was rife with special-effects trickery, in point of fact the series used such effects sparingly -- though always effectively, as with this classic episode. Awakened by the cries of their daughter Bettina, Chris and Ruth Miller (Robert Sampson and Sarah Marshall) enter the girl's bedroom, only to find that she has apparently disappeared. Still, they can hear her Bettina's cries for help, and in desperation, they call in their physicist friend Bill (Charles Aidman) for advice. Assessing the evidence at hand, Bill comes to the unsettling conclusion that Bettina has somehow fallen through an invisible hole into the Fourth Dimension -- and as time runs out, it is Bill who puts his own life on the line to rescue the girl. So vital to the proceedings was the musical score by Bernard Herrmann that, for the first and only time in Twilight Zone history, Herrmann was billed above the name of the director. Scripted by Richard Matheson from his own short story, "Little Girl Lost" was first telecast on March 16, 1962(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">G.I. Joe: Retaliation</title>
    <desc lang="en">The Joes reteam to prevent Cobra from achieving total world domination in this sequel that picks up shortly after the events of G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra. The Nanomite threat has been neutralized, and the U.S. government has imprisoned Cobra Commander and Destro in an inescapable subterranean prison. When the leader of Pakistan is assassinated, the U.S. president (Jonathan Pryce) calls on the Joes to secure Pakistan's nuclear warheads before they fall into enemy hands. In the wake of successfully completing their mission, however, the Joes are decimated in a devastating surprise attack. When the smoke clears, Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson), Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki), and Flint (D.J. Cotrona) are the sole survivors. They're convinced that something is amiss in the White House, and as Lady Jaye theorizes that an imposter is pretending to be the commander in chief, bad guys Storm Shadow (Lee Byung-hun) and Firefly (Ray Stevenson) team up to break Cobra Commander (Luke Bracey) out of prison. Later, as Storm Shadow retreats into the mountains to recover from burns incurred in the extraction, Snake Eyes (Ray Park) and Jinx (Elodie Yung) manage to capture the elusive white ninja, in the process discovering a shocking secret about his past and learning that Zartan (Arnold Vosloo), posing as the president, has called an international summit to discuss nuclear disarmament in order to bring the leaders of the world to their knees before the diabolical Cobra Commander. Now, as Cobra holds the entire globe hostage with a revolutionary new weapon placed on satellites orbiting the planet, it's up to the Joes and a trustworthy old friend to save the day(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back</title>
    <desc lang="en">Sequel to 'Star Wars' in which Luke Skywalker undergoes Jedi training from Yoda, while romance blossoms between Han Solo and Leia. Much darker and more complex than the original film, 'Empire' emphasises character revelations - including a surprise about Luke's parentage - without stinting on the action and visual effects, which won a special Oscar.
