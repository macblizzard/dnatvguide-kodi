    <desc lang="en">One of the most celebrated horror films of the late '70s is given a new look in this remake, produced by blockbuster filmmaker Michael Bay. George and Kathy Lutz (Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George) are a young couple who are looking for a new home, and think they've found a dream house in Amityville, Long Island -- a large and beautiful home available at a bargain price. George thinks that there must be a catch, and learns that the house has a dark history -- a year before, a man living in the house murdered his family in their sleep, claiming he was commanded to commit the crime by demons. Shrugging off stories that the house is haunted, George and Kathy move in with their three kids, only to discover that something evil lurks within the house, and even Father McNamara (Philip Baker Hall), an expert on possession, is powerless to clear the dark spirits from the home. The Amityville Horror was based on the same book by Jay Anson that provided the basis for the 1979 film, which in turn documented an actual incident(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Detectives investigate a shooting at the Eureka Gardens apartment complex in Jacksonville, Florida, where three gunmen have fired more than 50 rounds at a group of 10 people, including a baby. Despite numerous witnesses, nobody will talk to the police for fear of retribution, leaving the detectives to knock on doors in the hope that somebody breaks. This tension is mirrored in the courtroom at the trial of Lenard Anderson, who is accused of shooting another black man in a strip club.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Dallas Campbell, Professor Danielle George and Dr Hugh Hunt mark the 80th anniversary of Britain's very first TV broadcast by trying to recreate the landmark event. The inaugural programme came live from Alexandria Palace on November 2, 1936, but there are no surviving recordings of the show. In response, the presenter trio set out to recreate every aspect of this first broadcast, from the variety acts featured right down to the camera equipment used, using authentic technology and filming techniques. Plus, pioneering TV engineer John Logie Baird's assistant - now aged 104 - is on hand to lend some technical assistance, and Dallas meets a one of the performers who appeared on the first programme to find out what it is like to be part of TV history.(n)</desc>

Completed in 1890, the Forth Rail Bridge now carries around 200 trains every day. The last of the great Victorian engineering triumphs, it has grown to symbolise Scotland as much as Edinburgh Castle, bagpipes or kilts. But, as Rob learns, this incredible engineering achievement was born from the tragedy of the 1879 Tay Bridge disaster, and 73 deaths were connected with its construction and immediate aftermath.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May embark on a race from London's Wembley Stadium to Milan's San Siro, the home of Italian football giants AC and Inter. A price restriction leads Jeremy to grab the keys to a Shelby Mustang GT500, which costs the equivalent of £35,000 in America and packs a supercharged punch of more than 650bhp. James and Richard pin their hopes on the pan-European rail network in a bid to secure the prize of tickets to a top-flight football match, with nothing but a long journey home awaiting the losers. On the test track, Jeremy puts Toyota's GT86 coupe through its paces, and its promise of entertaining rear-wheel-drive handling should put a smile on his face. Plus, singer-songwriter Amy Macdonald gets to grips with the Reasonably Priced Car.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Clare Balding travels to South Africa to join a veterinary team trying to help a rhino called Thandi who was attacked by poachers for her horn. For the first time, a plastic surgeon will attempt a skin graft on the animal to heal the wound. She also visits the rainforest of Borneo to follow the story of an orangutan who needs cataracts removing from her eyes so that she can be released back into the wild. Elsewhere, vet Steve Leonard takes a trip to Chicago's Lincoln Park Zoo, where the latest technology is being used to help chimpanzees with heart disease. He also visits the South African city of Pretoria, where a Cape fur seal requires a CT scan to identify the root cause of her illness, and a giraffe urgently needs to be anaesthetised to treat a leg injury.(n)</desc>

Creatures travel thousands of miles to visit, from tiger sharks, great whales and seabirds to the largest green-turtle gathering on Earth and rarely seen alien-like creatures, such as the tentacled nautilus. The reef is also affected by weather systems travelling from across the Pacific, including cyclones that bring destruction and chaos to the coral and the creatures that live on it.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">An itinerant ex-military investigator is tasked with solving a shooting spree that isn't quite as cut-and-dry as it first seems as author Lee Child's 2005 novel One Shot comes to the big screen courtesy of writer/director Christopher McQuarrie. When a crazed sniper guns down five seemingly random people on a crowded Pittsburgh riverfront, Det. Emerson (David Oyelowo) quickly amasses enough evidence at the scene to implicate an unstable ex-military sniper named James Barr (Joseph Sikora). Upon being questioned by Emerson and DA Alex Rodin (Richard Jenkins), however, Barr demands to speak with Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise). A former military investigator who fell off the grid following his service, Reacher soon shows up on the scene and begins gathering clues with the aid of talented defense attorney Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike), the daughter of the DA. Meanwhile, when Reacher is assaulted in a local bar, he correctly surmises that someone is determined to impede his investigation. His theory plays out when he becomes the prime suspect in the murder of a young woman shortly thereafter. Now, with the police closing in from one side and a gang of ruthless killers gaining ground on the other, Reacher must use his formidable detective skills in order to catch the gunman and uncover his true motives(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Evil Dead</title>
    <desc lang="en">A trip into the woods turns into a terrifying battle against the forces of evil in this remake of Sam Raimi's ferocious 1981 horror classic. Mia (Jane Levy) is a heroin addict whose most recent overdose was nearly her last. Recognizing that she won't survive another, Mia's longtime friends Olivia (Jessica Lucas) and Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci) take the troubled girl to her family's old cabin in the woods to quit cold turkey. It isn't their first attempt, but this time they're hoping that with Mia's brother David (Shiloh Fernandez) around, she'll have the support she needs to weather the coming storm. The moment David arrives at the cabin with his girlfriend Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore), strange things start to happen; Mia complains about a foul smell that none of her friends can sense, and upon descending into the fruit cellar David and Eric discover what appears to be the scene of a dark ritual. Scattered amongst the animal corpses and mysterious artifacts is an old book that's been sealed shut with heavy-duty plastic and barbed wire. Intrigued, Eric manages to cut the book free and makes a disturbing discovery -- the book has been bound in human flesh, and it comes with an incantation that will unleash a powerful force of evil. Ignoring the warnings not to speak or even hear the incantation, Eric reads the words aloud, sealing his own dark fate, as well as those of his closest friends. One by one they will be possessed until no soul has been left unclaimed. The lucky ones will die first, their souls condemned to suffer as their bodies are twisted into an obscene aberration of flesh. Will the last person standing have the courage to send these sadistic demons back to hell, even if it means killing their friends and loved ones in the worst way imaginable, or will the forces unleashed by this unholy book prove too powerful for any one mortal to defeat?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A vengeful father comes to the aid of a mother, her teenage daughter, and a defenseless young couple on the one night of the year that all crime, including murder, is legal in this self-contained sequel from co-producer Jason Blum and original Purge writer/director James DeMonaco. As the countdown to the Purge starts ticking, struggling waitress Eva (Carmen Ejogo) risks her safety by staying late at work to ask her boss for a raise. Later, as she returns home to her elderly father (John Beasley) and daughter Cali (Zoë Soul), bickering couple Shane (Zach Gilford) and Liz (Kiele Sanchez) attempt to make their way out of the city following a frightening run-in with a gang of masked, machete-wielding thugs. While these five people are eager to seek sanctuary from the impending wave of violence about to flood the streets, a lone stranger (Frank Grillo) intent on seeking vengeance for the wrongful death of his son plans to draw blood from the man responsible. Armed to the teeth as he cruises the city in a modified muscle car, he gets sidetracked from his mission when he sees Eva and Cali fighting for their lives against a small army of black-clad soldiers. Against his better judgment, he rescues the pair, only realizing later that Shane and Liz also jumped into his backseat in order to escape a gang that disabled their car and were hunting them through the streets. When the stranger's car is similarly damaged beyond the point of repair, this unlikely group must stick together in order to survive the night. But little do they realize that their nightmare has only just begun(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Good Guy</title>
    <desc lang="en">After executive producing the acclaimed documentary Manda Bala and the J.M. Coetzee adaptation Disgrace, Julio DePietro makes his feature debut as a writer-director with The Good Guy, a drama about ambitious young Wall Streeters fighting each other -- and sometimes their own decent nature -- to get ahead in the world. Our narrator, Tommy (Scott Porter of TV's Friday Night Lights), is young, clever, charming, and attractive. He's got a smart, pretty girlfriend, Beth (Alexis Bledel of Gilmore Girls), an urban conservationist. He's also very good at his investment broker job, impressing his ruthless, cynical boss, Cash (erstwhile "Brat Pack" member Andrew McCarthy). When a key member of Tommy's sales team suddenly leaves for a competitor, Tommy needs to fill his spot quickly, and takes a chance on the bumbling Daniel (Bryan Greenberg, Bride Wars), a former Marine and computer geek who seems a bit naïve about high finance and a bit nervous around women. Tommy takes Daniel under his wing, showing him how to dress, where to socialize, and how to charm attractive women. Their relationship is threatened when Daniel begins spending more time with Beth, joining her book club, and becoming her confidant. Tommy begins to question his decision to share his wisdom with Daniel, while Daniel is forced to decide what success really means to him, and where his loyalties lie. The Good Guy also stars Anna Chlumsky (In the Loop) and Aaron Yoo (Disturbia). The film had its world premiere at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival(n)</desc>

The school is about to close for lack of funds, and Vivian wants to flee Philadelphia with eight of her charges and get to a farm in Washington State where the children can grow up in the fresh air and away from the urban environment. Joe is enlisted to drive the bus, which continually breaks down en route, permitting Joe plenty of time to interact with the kids -- taking them fishing, teaching them strip poker, and convincing a Vietnamese girl not to sell her body. The prim and proper Vivian holds up her nose at the vulgar and sloppy Joe, so it is inevitable that at journey's end the two will find true romance(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Sleepers</title>
    <desc lang="en">Barry Levinson directed this crime drama based on a controversial bestseller. Jason Patrick stars as Lorenzo, a New York reporter more commonly called "Shakes," a nickname courtesy of his three childhood pals from Hell's Kitchen -- Michael (Brad Pitt), John (Ron Eldard), and Tommy (Billy Crudup). As kids, all four were sent to reform school after accidentally killing someone during a cruel prank.

    <title lang="en">Sleepers</title>
    <desc lang="en">Barry Levinson directed this crime drama based on a controversial bestseller. Jason Patrick stars as Lorenzo, a New York reporter more commonly called "Shakes," a nickname courtesy of his three childhood pals from Hell's Kitchen -- Michael (Brad Pitt), John (Ron Eldard), and Tommy (Billy Crudup). As kids, all four were sent to reform school after accidentally killing someone during a cruel prank. There, the boys were raped and beaten by several guards, including Sean Nokes (Kevin Bacon), a fact that they've kept secret into adulthood. Michael is now a rising star in the district attorney's office, while John and Tommy are founders of the Irish gang the Westies.

    <title lang="en">Dave Chappelle's Block Party</title>
    <desc lang="en">In September 2004, comedian Dave Chappelle took a break from his immensely successful Comedy Central show to stage a free, unpublicized, all-star hip-hop concert in the Clinton Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn, NY. Inviting fans over the Internet, on the street, and even in his family's hometown of Yellow Springs, OH, Chappelle asked filmmaker Michel Gondry to document the event from its inception on through to the performances themselves. The result is Dave Chappelle's Block Party, a concert film that provides not only a sampling of the music on display that September, but also an intimate look at the comedian himself. Gondry's cameras tag along with Chappelle as he visits Ohio, recruits a university marching band to play at the show, and surveys the opinions of Clinton Hill on the show that's about to take place. Along the way, we're introduced to some the comedian's favorite acts, in rehearsals and on-stage: Dead Prez, Jill Scott, Mos Def, the Roots, Erykah Badu, Kanye West, and the surprise reuniting of the Fugees(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Grand Visions is a short season of films driven by the vision and boldness of strong directors; passion projects made on a grand and uncompromising scale. The season kicks off with director Baz Luhrmann's western/ war adventure/ romance hybrid that's set in the Australian outback and stars Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman. It is 1939 and Lady Sarah Ashley has travelled halfway round the world to persuade her husband to sell his cattle station and return back home to Blighty. It's soon obvious that she hasn't anticipated the primitive realities of life in northern Australia, nor has her upbringing prepared her for an encounter with the likes of the rough and ready drover who is instructed to chaperone her from Darwin to the ranch. But the pair are fated to become much more closely acquainted than either could have imagined. The plot also encompasses the lot of the region's Aboriginal people, via the plight of local lad Nullah, and the first Japanese attacks on the northern territories. Edited for language(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Michael is still reeling from Chrissie's rejection, and goes all out when faced with a heart-breaking case involving a father and son - jeopardising his career in the process. Gemma makes a mistake that almost costs a patient's life, forcing her to question her future at Holby. Elliot remains in hiding after last week's operation ended badly - so Jac, unable to tolerate his self-pity, tries to force her colleague back into theatre - and Mary-Claire grows increasingly tired of Edward's snide remarks.(n)</desc>

A makeover and grand relaunch party seemed to mark a turning point in its fortunes, and Alex now finds out if Andy and Bonny have managed to keep up the good work.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Felicia's Journey</title>
    <desc lang="en">Directed by Atom Egoyan, Felicia's Journey is a low-key psychological thriller about the relationship between a lovesick young woman and an older man with an ugly secret. Felicia (Elaine Cassidy) has lived all of her life in a small village in rural Ireland. She has fallen in love with a boy named Johnny (Peter McDonald), so when Johnny unexpectedly travels to England in search of a job, Felicia wants to follow him -- especially since she's pregnant, a fact that she's keeping secret from her family, as well as Johnny. However, Johnny's family refuses to give her his address, so she leaves for Birmingham with only a sketchy idea of his whereabouts. Shortly after arriving, Felicia encounters Joseph Ambrose Hilditch (Bob Hoskins), the meticulous manager of a catering concern. She needs a place to stay and he recommends a good bed-and-breakfast. They soon become friendly, but Hilditch is more than just a mildly eccentric middle-aged man with a taste for French cuisine: he's had a long history of using and abusing homeless women, and Felicia looks like she's doomed to be the next victim. Based on a novel by William Trevor, Felicia's Journey was shown in competition at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival(n)</desc>

An unnamed catastrophe has turned the Earth into a wasteland, and as packs of feral cannibals wander the countryside, a dwindling number of survivors struggle to stay alive. Rick (Dominic Monaghan), Adam (Shawn Ashmore), Henson (Cory Hardrict), and Shannon (Shannyn Sossamon) have been journeying together for months and are the last living members of a much larger group.

The travelers take shelter in a house, but are soon surrounded by cannibals; they quickly realize just how strong a warrior Mary can be, while also discovering the terrible truth that led her to wander alone.

    <title lang="en">Darkness Falls</title>
    <desc lang="en">Children have a very good reason to be afraid of the dark in this flashy horror story. Matilda Dixon was a genially eccentric woman who, in the 1850s, lived in a New England town known as Darkness Falls. Matilda was well known to the local children for her habit of paying them for teeth they'd lost, but when two youngsters mysteriously disappeared, Matilda was lynched by an angry mob wrongly convinced that she had murdered the kids. In the year 2002, former Darkness Falls resident Kyle Walsh (Chaney Kley) lives in Las Vegas and is still desperately afraid of the dark since a childhood run-in with the ghost of Matilda Dixon left him severely traumatized. While police and psychiatrists scoffed at Kyle's stories about Matilda's spirit, his childhood friend Caitlin (Emma Caulfield) is alarmed when her nine-year-old brother Michael (Lee Cormie) begins having nightmares very much like those which disturbed Kyle's rest for years. Like Kyle, Michael has little luck convincing most grown-ups that the white-robed specters he sees in the dark are real, so Caitlin asks Kyle to return to Darkness Falls to help get to the bottom of his story. Darkness Falls marked the directorial debut of filmmaker Jonathan Liebesman(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Darkness Falls</title>
    <desc lang="en">Children have a very good reason to be afraid of the dark in this flashy horror story. Matilda Dixon was a genially eccentric woman who, in the 1850s, lived in a New England town known as Darkness Falls. Matilda was well known to the local children for her habit of paying them for teeth they'd lost, but when two youngsters mysteriously disappeared, Matilda was lynched by an angry mob wrongly convinced that she had murdered the kids. In the year 2002, former Darkness Falls resident Kyle Walsh (Chaney Kley) lives in Las Vegas and is still desperately afraid of the dark since a childhood run-in with the ghost of Matilda Dixon left him severely traumatized. While police and psychiatrists scoffed at Kyle's stories about Matilda's spirit, his childhood friend Caitlin (Emma Caulfield) is alarmed when her nine-year-old brother Michael (Lee Cormie) begins having nightmares very much like those which disturbed Kyle's rest for years. Like Kyle, Michael has little luck convincing most grown-ups that the white-robed specters he sees in the dark are real, so Caitlin asks Kyle to return to Darkness Falls to help get to the bottom of his story. Darkness Falls marked the directorial debut of filmmaker Jonathan Liebesman(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The con is off. After eight years of grifting, Mickey is ready for retirement but has one final target in his sights - crooked businessman Madani Wasem, who could give him and the others a £10million payday in a stock-market scam. Even better, Wasem's broker turns out to be none other than old team member Stacie Monroe, who proves to be a useful insider. But their prey is a dangerous man, and when an order goes out to kill Mickey once the deal is done, it looks like the hustler's retirement is going to be rather permanent. Adrian Lester heads the regular cast in their final outing, with a guest appearance by Jaime Murray.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">No</title>
    <desc lang="en">Gael García Bernal stars in Chilean director Pablo Larraín's third drama to probe the dark realities of life in his country under the brutal Pinochet regime. The Oscar-nominated No is as fascinating as the previous two works, though rather less immediately shocking and violent. It's 1988 and, after 15 years of his oppressive dictatorship, there's to be a referendum over whether Augusto Pinochet should stay in power for another eight years. Young advertising executive René Saavedra has agreed to produce the nightly 15-minute TV ads for the 'No' campaign. However, to the dismay of the anti-Pinochet lobby, he doesn't intend to air daily reminders of the brutality and atrocities Chile has had to endure. Instead, he aims to employ colourful, upbeat images and bright messages of a hopeful future to persuade the country to vote no. But, given the comfortable lives now lived by Chile's middle classes and the general air of cynicism around the referendum (which many see as a foregone conclusion), will it work? And what are Saavedra's real motives: democracy for his nation, or a chance to win back his estranged wife? Also starring Alfredo Castro as Saavedra's boss, who's running the ad campaign for the 'Yes' vote. In Spanish with English subtitles(n)</desc>

However, a bogus neighborhood Santa Claus (Rickey Smiley) decides to help Craig and Day-Day share the wealth by robbing their apartment, and when he rips off their stereo, he also makes off with their rent money, which was hidden in the speaker cabinets. Desperate to make rent and have some money for Christmas presents, Craig and Day-Day land jobs at a local strip mall, where their fathers, Mr. Jones (John Witherspoon) and Uncle Elroy (Don "D.C." Curry), have gone into business together running a barbecue joint. Craig and Day-Day are installed as security guards, and while Craig tries to make time with Donna (K.D. Aubert), a saleswoman at the Pimp N' Ho's Boutique, and keep things orderly at Holy Moly's Doughnut Shop, Day-Day attempts to transform himself into a master of crime-fighting, which causes a lot more problems than it solves. Friday After Next is the first feature film from director Marcus Raboy, who previously directed music videos for Sting, Li'l Kim, Staind, and Friday After Next star Ice Cube(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The gang from Friday and Next Friday are back in this urban comedy, in which Craig (Ice Cube) and Day-Day (Mike Epps) have finally moved out of their respective parents' homes and gotten an apartment together. However, a bogus neighborhood Santa Claus (Rickey Smiley) decides to help Craig and Day-Day share the wealth by robbing their apartment, and when he rips off their stereo, he also makes off with their rent money, which was hidden in the speaker cabinets. Desperate to make rent and have some money for Christmas presents, Craig and Day-Day land jobs at a local strip mall, where their fathers, Mr. Jones (John Witherspoon) and Uncle Elroy (Don "D.C." Curry), have gone into business together running a barbecue joint. Craig and Day-Day are installed as security guards, and while Craig tries to make time with Donna (K.D. Aubert), a saleswoman at the Pimp N' Ho's Boutique, and keep things orderly at Holy Moly's Doughnut Shop, Day-Day attempts to transform himself into a master of crime-fighting, which causes a lot more problems than it solves. Friday After Next is the first feature film from director Marcus Raboy, who previously directed music videos for Sting, Li'l Kim, Staind, and Friday After Next star Ice Cube(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A woman discovers that when it comes to love, sometimes opposites really do attract in this romantic comedy-drama. Kenya (Sanaa Lathan) is a successful African-American lawyer in her mid-thirties whose personal life is not going as well as her career. While she's attractive and intelligent, Kenya has rather high standards and isn't willing to settle for a man who isn't everything she wants. While attending a party, Kenya is introduced to Brian (Simon Baker), a landscape architect who handles the gardening at her host's mansion. Brian is immediately and obviously attracted to Kenya, through she doesn't feel the same way at all. However, she likes his work and hires him to refurbish her garden; before long, he asks her out on a date, and against her better judgment she accepts. While Kenya and Brian have little in common, in time they hit it off, and a romance begins to blossom between them. However, Brian happens to be white, which ruffles some feathers among Kenya's friends and family, who try to find her a more suitable, African-American suitor.

Ordering Fletcher back into the spaceship, Craig stays behind, looking forward to a long and fruitful reign over the little people. . .a reign that comes to an abrupt end in a most ironic fashion.

Despite his constant gas-bagging about his alleged past acts of heroism, no one believes Frisby's tall tales -- no one, that is, except a team of space aliens, who accept Frisby's lies at face value. On the verge of being whisked off to another planet as a zoo specimen, Frisby stumbles upon a method of overpowering his extraterrestial captors (a method, incidentally, that would be expanded upon in the 1997 sci-fi movie spoof Mars Attacks!) Scripted by Rod Serling from a story by Frederic Louis Fox (in which Frisby became an outer-space TV personality), the fitfully funny Twilight Zone installment "Hocus-Pocus and Frisby" first aired April 13, 1962(n)</desc>

Lake Victoria may look peaceful, but beneath the placid waters of this painterly lake lurks a deadly menace. A powerful underwater tremor has released scores of man-eating prehistoric fish into the waters, and now it's up to a group of unlikely heroes to band together and defeat the razor-toothed predators. With time running out and the aquatic carnivores taking over, one brave heroine (Elisabeth Shue) will risk everything to save the lake and prevent her family from becoming fish food. Richard Dreyfuss, Ving Rhames, Jerry O'Connell, and Adam Scott star in the Dimension Films production(n)</desc>
