Ultimately, the mother and daughter are able to relocate to an apartment, which, despite its excessively dilapidated interior, seems to be an adequate location for beginning a new life. Before long, however, what appears to be the spirit of a young girl begins to haunt them. No stranger to mental illness, the wary young woman brushes the visions aside as part of the inherent stress of making the transition from housewife to working, single mom. As time goes by and the apparent haunting does not subside, the apartment's new residents are forced to examine the history of its former tenants. Dark Water also features performances from John C. Reilly, Tim Roth, and Dougray Scott(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Amityville Horror</title>
    <desc lang="en">One of the most celebrated horror films of the late '70s is given a new look in this remake, produced by blockbuster filmmaker Michael Bay. George and Kathy Lutz (Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George) are a young couple who are looking for a new home, and think they've found a dream house in Amityville, Long Island -- a large and beautiful home available at a bargain price.

    <title lang="en">The Perfect Storm</title>
    <desc lang="en">In October 1991, a dying tropical hurricane from Bermuda collided with a cold front from the Great Lakes, resulting in a "perfect storm" of previously unknown destructive impact that resulted in 100-foot waves; tragically, the crew of a fishing boat was lost in the midst of the fearsome storm. Based on the best-selling book by Sebastian Junger, The Perfect Storm tells the story of the ship's brave and hard-working crew. Billy Tyne, captain of the Andrea Gail, hasn't had much luck finding catch on his most recent trips to sea, and with money short, he and his crew -- Bob Shatford, Dale Murphy, and David Sullivan set out again when they hear that the fish are running. Billy's hunch proves correct, but when the ship's refrigeration system goes haywire, they have to return to shore as quickly as possible before the fish spoil, sending them into the middle of the worst storm in history(n)</desc>

Jolie is Lara Croft, a proper British aristocrat groomed at schools for the children of the elite. Croft leads a double life, however, as an acquirer of lost antiquities through questionable means, highly trained in combat skills with the help of a robotic opponent called Simon. Despite her exciting profession and a life of wealth and breeding, Lara pines for her father, Lord Croft (Jon Voight), whose passing left her orphaned. On the eve of a celestial event that will also mark the anniversary of Lord Croft's death, Lara comes up against an ancient organization called the Illuminati, represented by the sinister Powell (Iain Glen), who's in pursuit of an ancient relic with power over time and even death itself. With the aid of her high-tech support team, Lara travels to some exotic locales in search of the artifact, including a foray into a decrepit Asian temple guarded by lethal stone apes and other creatures that spring to life.

The actor has only one photo of his ancestor, which shows him aged roughly 17 and wearing a military uniform. By zooming in on the picture, Martin's brother was able to identify their grandfather's badge, which suggests he was in the Royal Marines. Now, by meeting with a military historian, Martin tries to fill in the rest of the story, and in the process learns more about Edwin's role in defending Birmingham against German air assaults during the Second World War.(n)</desc>

He heads to the Arctic for a trip along the Alaska Railroad, but as he arrives in the port of Seward, it's not a great start as there are no trains running, so he ends up hitching a ride with a track inspector's car. He continues his journey on a freight train heading for Anchorage, Alaska's biggest city, and finally heads north on the Aurora passenger train to the town of Healy. Along the way he checks out the tiny village of Eklutna, which has great importance for the indigenous inhabitants, and goes for an intrepid fishing trip on a thawing frozen lake.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">American Pie</title>
    <desc lang="en">It's said that most American men think about sex once every two or three minutes, but this statistic would seriously underestimate the horniness of Jim (Jason Biggs), a high school senior in suburban Michigan. Jim is thoroughly obsessed with sex, a fact of which his parents become aware when they discover him performing the sin of Onan with a gym sock while watching scrambled pay-per-view porn. Jim's buddies Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), and Oz (Chris Klein) are no less anxious to relieve themselves of their virginity, so they all make a pledge: they will go to bed with a woman in the three weeks before senior prom or die trying. Kevin appears to have the advantage, since he already has a girlfriend, Vicky (Tara Reid), but before he ventures into the Final Frontier, Kevin is urged to consult "The Bible," a hand-written how-to manual possessing erotic wisdom passed down through the ages. Oz is a good-looking jock who is actually a nice guy -- which is part of the problem, since he has his heart set on a nice girl, Heather (Mena Suvari), who does not seem the type to leap into bed within 21 days. Finch has no immediate prospects, though Jessica (Natasha Lyonne) is in a position to know if those rumors about him are true. And Jim is a truly hopeless case -- after his attempted seduction of beautiful Czech exchange student Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) turns out to be a disaster, he ends up going to the prom with Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), an annoyingly chatty band geek who does, however, have a fascinating story about a flute. American Pie was the directorial debut of Paul Weitz, who, along with his brother Chris Weitz (who served as producer), previously wrote several screenplays, including Antz and Madeline (where they presumably worked all their wholesome ideas out of their system)(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">It's said that most American men think about sex once every two or three minutes, but this statistic would seriously underestimate the horniness of Jim (Jason Biggs), a high school senior in suburban Michigan. Jim is thoroughly obsessed with sex, a fact of which his parents become aware when they discover him performing the sin of Onan with a gym sock while watching scrambled pay-per-view porn. Jim's buddies Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), and Oz (Chris Klein) are no less anxious to relieve themselves of their virginity, so they all make a pledge: they will go to bed with a woman in the three weeks before senior prom or die trying. Kevin appears to have the advantage, since he already has a girlfriend, Vicky (Tara Reid), but before he ventures into the Final Frontier, Kevin is urged to consult "The Bible," a hand-written how-to manual possessing erotic wisdom passed down through the ages. Oz is a good-looking jock who is actually a nice guy -- which is part of the problem, since he has his heart set on a nice girl, Heather (Mena Suvari), who does not seem the type to leap into bed within 21 days. Finch has no immediate prospects, though Jessica (Natasha Lyonne) is in a position to know if those rumors about him are true. And Jim is a truly hopeless case -- after his attempted seduction of beautiful Czech exchange student Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) turns out to be a disaster, he ends up going to the prom with Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), an annoyingly chatty band geek who does, however, have a fascinating story about a flute. American Pie was the directorial debut of Paul Weitz, who, along with his brother Chris Weitz (who served as producer), previously wrote several screenplays, including Antz and Madeline (where they presumably worked all their wholesome ideas out of their system)(n)</desc>

Eventually the boys and girls are able to overcome their hysterical need to avoid each other. "Proper Condim Use" first aired August 1, 2001, on Comedy Central(n)</desc>

However, Britain still had a powerful navy and some of the finest fighter planes ever built and had also made two powerful technological breakthroughs - radar and the cracking of the German Enigma codes - that would give it a vital edge in the Battle of Britain. Prime minister Winston Churchill then began the fightback, with commando raids and help for the resistance in occupied Europe.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Hosted--or rather, refereed--by boxing expert Max Kellerman, this lively cable-TV discussion show featured four sports columnists, each from a different part of the USA, discussing recent pro-athletic developments in a sort of electronic summit meeting. Kellerman determined how much time each of the columnists would be permitted to express his or her opinions--and he was harsh indeed, frequently limiting the discourse to ten seconds or less. At the end of the show, Kellerman would award points for the most cogent opinions and arguments, and also subtract points from contributors whom he determined had not effectively expressed themselves. The inagural episode of ESPN's Around the Horn was seen on September 30, 2002(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Around the Horn</title>
    <desc lang="en">Hosted--or rather, refereed--by boxing expert Max Kellerman, this lively cable-TV discussion show featured four sports columnists, each from a different part of the USA, discussing recent pro-athletic developments in a sort of electronic summit meeting. Kellerman determined how much time each of the columnists would be permitted to express his or her opinions--and he was harsh indeed, frequently limiting the discourse to ten seconds or less. At the end of the show, Kellerman would award points for the most cogent opinions and arguments, and also subtract points from contributors whom he determined had not effectively expressed themselves. The inagural episode of ESPN's Around the Horn was seen on September 30, 2002(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Sucker Punch</title>
    <desc lang="en">The story of Alice in Wonderland receives a hyper-violent makeover in Watchmen and 300 director Zack Snyder's fantastical tale of a young psychiatric patient who escapes into a vivid world of fantasy after being committed to a mental hospital by her abusive stepfather. Set in the 1950s, Sucker Punch takes viewers on an incredible journey into the mind of Babydoll (Emily Browning), who finds herself at the mercy of her malevolent stepfather after her mother passes away. With no remaining family and no friends to turn to, her stepfather has her committed to a bleak mental hospital, where she is scheduled to receive a lobotomy in five days. As the procedure draws near, Babydoll creates a phantasmagorical alternate reality in which she must seek out five items in order to secure her freedom. Should she fail, her mind isn't the only thing she stands to lose. Abbie Cornish, Vanessa Hudgens, Carla Gugino, and Jon Hamm co-star in a film co-written by Snyder and Steve Shibuya(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Hollywood Ending</title>
    <desc lang="en">A down-on-his luck auteur gets one more chance at the big time -- provided his neuroses don't swallow him whole -- in Woody Allen's 33rd feature release, Hollywood Ending. Allen plays Val Waxman, a one-time cinematic genius who's resorted to taking advertisement work to pay the bills for himself and his airhead live-in girlfriend, Lori (Debra Messing). Val finds his luck is about to change, however, when he receives the script for The City Never Sleeps, a period noir set against the backdrop of 1940s New York City. It seems his ex-wife, Ellie (Tea Leoni), now an executive at Galaxy Pictures, has been pulling for him to direct the picture, claiming he's the only man who can do justice to the script. She even manages to convince her boyfriend, Hal (Treat Williams), Galaxy's high-powered studio head, to take a chance on Val's "unique vision." Just when the cameras are ready to roll, however, Val finds that unique vision in jeopardy -- literally -- as he's struck with a psychosomatic case of blindness. When physicians and psychiatrists fail to cure him, Val contrives a scheme to forge ahead with the picture, for fear of blowing his one last chance at greatness. Hollywood Ending co-stars George Hamilton and Mark Rydell(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">P.S. I Love You</title>
    <desc lang="en">A grieving widow finds her husband's warmth radiating from the afterlife when she discovers that he left her a series of tasks to be revealed in ten monthly messages and designed to help her overcome her sorrow while gradually making the transition into a new life. Holly Kennedy (Hilary Swank) is a New York real estate broker whose good-humored husband, Irishman Gerry (Gerard Butler), always stood by her side. Suddenly, and seemingly out of nowhere, Gerry succumbs to a brain tumor and Holly is left to face an uncertain future. No one in the world knows Holly better than Gerry, not even her mother (Kathy Bates) or her best friends, Sharon (Gina Gershon) and Denise (Lisa Kudrow). But while Holly remains unsure if she can go on without the love of her life to help guide her, Gerry has planned ahead. On Holly's 30th birthday, she receives a cake and a special tape recording from Gerry that implores her to get out and celebrate instead of staying in and mourning. Later, as the months wear on, a series of additional messages arrive from Gerry -- always delivered in the most remarkable and surprising of ways. With each new message comes a new adventure, and each letter signs off in the same familiar way: "P.S. I love you." Despite the fact that Holly's mother and friends think these humorous, posthumous messages are keeping Holly bound to the past, the truth is that they are lovingly guiding her into the future while proving that sometimes death isn't just the end, but a new beginning as well. Director Richard LaGravenese teams with screenwriter Steve Rogers to adapt author Cecelia Ahern's best-selling novel(n)</desc>

The house is very dull, except for a large, ornate wardrobe discovered by young Lucy during a game of hide-and-seek. Venturing inside of it in the hopes of finding a hiding place, Lucy is transported to a snowy alternate universe: a magical world called Narnia. The land is populated by talking animals and ruled over by the benevolent lion god Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson), but sadly, the world is also in a state of perpetual winter. The white witch Jadis (Tilda Swinton), lustful for power and governed by narcissism, has cursed Narnia with a tyrannical decree that it will always be winter but never Christmas. Now, the children must fight alongside Aslan for the salvation of Narnia, but one of them, seduced by the charisma of the white witch, may choose to fight on the wrong side(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Two men who have made a career out of spinning remarkable stories find themselves bringing them to life in this inventive fantasy inspired by the creators of some of the world's best-loved fairy tales. Will Grimm (Matt Damon) and his brother Jake Grimm (Heath Ledger) earn their living by traveling from village to village and vanquishing strange supernatural beasts that have been menacing the populace. Or at least that's what their clients think has been happening; as it happens, Will and Jake are confidence men who cleverly stage the ghostly attacks and then take payment for making the creatures they fabricated go away. One day, the brothers arrive in a town and offer to help its people drive away evil spirits, unaware that the community is bordered by a genuine enchanted forest, and that young girls in the village have been disappearing at a frightful rate. The Grimm Brothers must now learn how to deal with real magic, with the help of the lovely but fearless Angelika (Lena Headey). Directed by Terry Gilliam, The Brothers Grimm also stars Monica Bellucci, Peter Stormare, and Jonathan Pryce(n)</desc>

And, like all her friends, she dreams of having a chance to appear on it. However, this is Baltimore and it is 1962 - and Tracy's both overweight and, worse, has liberal attitudes to race relations, which don't sit comfortably with the segregationist views of the show's producer (Michelle Pfeiffer). But could Tracy's ambitions for not only appearing on the show, but also racially integrating it, receive a fillip when she meets the son of Motormouth Maybelle (Latifah), host of the monthly 'Negro Day' edition of the show?

    <desc lang="en">Cocoon 2: The Return, like most sequels, relies a bit too heavily on one's familiarity with the first film. Without dwelling too long on Cocoon #1, we can observe that it ended with a group of senior citizens heading for the distant planet of Antarea, hoping to find a new, rewarding and elongated life. Cocoon 2 picks up the action five years later: The Antareans return to earth to check on the damage caused to their life-regenerating cocoons by earthquakes. Coming along for the ride are the elderly couples whom we met in the first film. Also carried over from the first Cocoon are young ferryboat captain Steve Guttenberg and gorgeous Antarean Tahnee Welch, who resume their interplanetary romance. Oldster Jack Gilford, whose beloved wife died in Cocoon, likewise finds romance in the form of Elaine Stritch. A secondary plot involves an insidious secret government plan to exploit the Antareans, which is foiled by sympathetic researcher Courteney Cox(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Caroline Quentin meets Hayley and Alan, who bought a derelict 19th-century chapel in south Wales for £25,000. They hoped to transform the vestry into a spacious three-bedroom home and then get a mortgage to restore the whole building, but the scope of the task and the tightness of their £20,000 budget soon hits home. The historical investigation charts the rise and importance of chapels such as this and how an act passed in the 17th century would fundamentally change the fortunes of worshippers.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Wheelers, Dealers and Del Boys: `Luvvly Jubbly'.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Documentary following the real-life wheeler-dealers who scour auction houses, car-boot sales and junk shops, dreaming of finding that precious item that will one day transform them into millionaires. The film introduces London couple Richie and Nikki, who have been at the auction game for the past decade and specialise in gold, and Pontypridd man Ieuan, who strikes it lucky at a sale when he is the only buyer to recognise a Rolex watch. At least, that's what he thinks it is. There's also the story of Essex husband and wife Al and Sharon, who gave up work to become full-time dealers and now recycle old items to sell on. But their home is getting overrun with stock.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Courtship.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">A further selection of creepy-crawly close-ups, focusing on courtship in the bug world. Highlights include scorpions shaking their booty, the perfume-wearing nasonia wasp and the tropical cricket, for whom romance goes out of the window as it uses bribery to seal the deal with would-be partners. One potential partner to steer well clear of, however, is the praying mantis, the female of which is notorious for eating the male just after - or even during - mating. Narrated by David Attenborough.(n)</desc>

Size matters for the minuscule male orb spider, creepily sneaking up on its intended and trying to mate without her noticing, while there's no rest for the lothario-like butterfly, which has plenty of notches on its proverbial bedpost. However, the harvestman spider has no use for sex at all, and reproduces by cloning itself.(n)</desc>

But such was the power of the tobacco company, they threatened a lawsuit that could have put CBS out of business. Mann maintains the tension of the fractious relationships between Wigand, Bergman, the CBS executives, the courts and the tobacco company to raise it to thriller level, with the end always in doubt, as Bergman battles for the truth to be told(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Love Actually</title>
    <desc lang="en">All of London is in love -- or longing to be -- in Four Weddings and a Funeral writer Richard Curtis' first directorial effort. Billed as "the ultimate romantic comedy," Love Actually involves more than a dozen main characters, each weaving his or her way into another's heart over the course of one particularly eventful Christmas. The seemingly perfect wedding of Juliet (Keira Knightley) and Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor) brings many of the principals together, including heartsick best man Mark (Andrew Lincoln), who harbors a very unrequited crush on Juliet. There's also recent widower Daniel (Liam Neeson), trying to help his lonely stepson Sam (Thomas Sangster) express his true feelings to a classmate. Across town, devoted working mother Karen (Emma Thompson) tries to rekindle the passion of her husband, Harry (Alan Rickman), who secretly pines for a young colleague of his. In the same office, the lonely Sarah (Laura Linney) not-so-secretly pines for a man just a few desks away (Rodrigo Santoro), who returns her affections but may not be able to dissuade her neuroses. Providing the unofficial soundtrack for all of the couples is an aging rocker (Bill Nighy) who just wants to cash in and get laid -- but even he might find a meaningful relationship in the most unlikely of places. A working print of Love Actually premiered at the 2003 Toronto International Film Festival(n)</desc>

But such was the power of the tobacco company, they threatened a lawsuit that could have put CBS out of business.

    <title lang="en">Love Actually</title>
    <desc lang="en">All of London is in love -- or longing to be -- in Four Weddings and a Funeral writer Richard Curtis' first directorial effort. Billed as "the ultimate romantic comedy," Love Actually involves more than a dozen main characters, each weaving his or her way into another's heart over the course of one particularly eventful Christmas. The seemingly perfect wedding of Juliet (Keira Knightley) and Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor) brings many of the principals together, including heartsick best man Mark (Andrew Lincoln), who harbors a very unrequited crush on Juliet. There's also recent widower Daniel (Liam Neeson), trying to help his lonely stepson Sam (Thomas Sangster) express his true feelings to a classmate. Across town, devoted working mother Karen (Emma Thompson) tries to rekindle the passion of her husband, Harry (Alan Rickman), who secretly pines for a young colleague of his. In the same office, the lonely Sarah (Laura Linney) not-so-secretly pines for a man just a few desks away (Rodrigo Santoro), who returns her affections but may not be able to dissuade her neuroses. Providing the unofficial soundtrack for all of the couples is an aging rocker (Bill Nighy) who just wants to cash in and get laid -- but even he might find a meaningful relationship in the most unlikely of places. A working print of Love Actually premiered at the 2003 Toronto International Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Roost</title>
    <desc lang="en">Creatures of the night find new prey on the scariest night of the year in this horror story. It's Halloween night, and four friends -- Allison (Vanessa Horneff), Elliott (Wil Horneff), Trevor (Karl Jacob), and Brian (Sean Reid) -- are on a road trip en route to a friend's wedding when their car breaks down after running into something. Looking for help, the four happen upon the farmhouse of an elderly couple, Elvin (Richard Little) and May (Barbara Wilhide), which is located next to a huge barn. Elvin and May have already become lost in the darkness of the barn, and soon two of the lost travelers are suffering the same fate as they search for friendly strangers. However, while they can barely see a hand in front of their face, they discover they're not alone in the barn, which has become home to a huge swarm of bloodthirsty bats. The Roost is framed by an introduction and postscript from a television horror show host, played by Tom Noonan(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A young bride says "until death do us part," but finds that doesn't necessarily put an end to her romance in this offbeat blend of horror, comedy, and romance. Danny (Graham Sibley) and Denise (Tracy Coogan) are a young couple who have just gotten married and head off to a beachside bungalow to celebrate their honeymoon. While enjoying a sunny afternoon on the beach, Danny and Denise's idyllic getaway takes a turn for the worse when a monster rises from the ocean and attacks Danny. The creature spews poison into Danny's mouth, and soon the new husband is dead. But Danny isn't gone for long -- he unexpectedly regains consciousness, but Denise soon learns that her new mate has become a flesh-eating zombie, and that the former vegetarian now has a taste for human beings. But Danny still has one link with the world of the living -- he loves Denise with all his heart, and struggles to keep his monstrous appetites under control for her sake, while Denise remains deeply in love with Danny, and tries to adjust to the strange and monstrous changes taking place in the man she married. Zombie Honeymoon was written and directed by Dave Gebroe, who was inspired to make the film by his sister, a horror film fan who lost her husband in a surfing accident not long after they were wed(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Robocop</title>
    <desc lang="en">A powerful multinational conglomerate attempts to bring robotic law enforcement to the United States by transforming a critically injured police officer into a cyborg cop in this remake of the subversive 1987 sci-fi classic. The year is 2028. For a long time, cutting-edge robotics company OmniCorp has been supplying the U.S. military with drones for use overseas, though their repeated attempts to bring the technology stateside has met with fierce resistance. When devoted family man and upstanding Detroit policeman Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) is grievously wounded in the line of duty, OmniCorp CEO Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton) attempts to innovate by recruiting top scientist Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman) to transform Murphy into a prototype half-man/half-robot crime-fighter. When initial tests fail to provide the results OmniCorp had hoped for, Norton reprograms Robocop to operate strictly on software rather than human emotion. Later, Robocop finally hits the streets, and the citizens of the crime-ridden city welcome him with open arms. But as Murphy's emotions begin to interfere with his programming, he sets out to find the criminals who nearly killed him, and ensure that justice is served. Abbie Cornish, Samuel L. Jackson, Jay Baruchel, and Jackie Earle Haley co-star(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Surfer, Dude</title>
    <desc lang="en">Hands on a Hard Body director S.R. Bindler directs this wave-twisting tale of a soul-searching surfer (Matthew McConaughey) in the midst of an existential crisis. Steve Addington (McConaughey) is an herb-toking long-boarder with a keen sense of balance and a mellow outlook on life. Upon returning to his hometown of Malibu to spend the summer with old friends, Steve begins to sense that the good vibes he remembers as a boy have been hopelessly corrupted by the powers that be. When the earthen surfer is faced with the prospect of expanding into virtual-reality video games and reality television or risk being rendered irrelevant, he opts to keep riding the majestic Southern California waves rather than participate in this new digital reality. Fate seems to intercede, however, when the ocean simply ceases to produce any suitable waves. His finances dried up, his sponsored expense accounts suddenly canceled, and his friends flocking off to bluer pastures, the surfer without a wave suddenly realizes that he has but two choices in life: he can either sit tight and try to keep his sanity until the waves come rolling in again, or finally give in to the Man and his intoxicating world of artificial amusements. Perhaps with a little wisdom from his trusted manager (Woody Harrelson), his aging mentor (Scott Glenn), his guardian angel (Willie Nelson), and his newfound muse (Alexie Gilmore), Addington can somehow manage to maintain his mellow just long enough to put it all into perspective and get back to the basics(n)</desc>

Gary Soneji (Michael Wincott) is a brilliant but remorseless psychopath who has landed a teaching position at an exclusive private school in Washington, D.C. Using his extensive knowledge of kidnapping (he's taught a class on Charles Lindbergh), Soneji abducts one of his students - Megan (Mika Boorem), whose father Hank Rose (Michael Moriarty) is a United States senator. Ollie MacArthur (Dylan Baker), the detective investigating the case, has strong words for Jezzie Flannigan (Monica Potter), the Secret Service agent who mistakenly let Megan slip through her fingers. But when the kidnapper contacts Dr. Cross, the psychologist is brought in on the case, and Cross seeks out Flannigan, who he believes might have a valuable insight into the case. Soon, Cross and Flannigan come to the terrible realization that this crime only represents the tip of the iceberg for the ruthless Soneji. Along Came a Spider also features Penelope Ann Miller, Jay O. Sanders, and Kim Hawthorne(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Grandma's Boy</title>
    <desc lang="en">Can the world's oldest adolescent maintain his cool while living with his grandmother? Alex (Allen Covert) is a 35-year-old video-game fanatic who gave up a career in accounting to take a job testing games for Brainasium, the company behind the wildly popular game "Eternal Death Slayer." While Alex took a big pay cut to land his dream job, he's happy with his work and is making ends meet -- until he discovers that his roommate hasn't paid the rent for the last six months, using the money to finance repeated visits to a local massage parlor. After running out of friends who will let him sleep on their couch, Alex swallows his pride and moves in with his grandma Lily (Doris Roberts), who loves Alex and is happy to give him a place to stay in exchange for doing chores around the house. Lily shares her home with two friends, perpetually confused Bea (Shirley Knight) and sexually adventurous Grace (Shirley Jones), and between the three of them, there's always work to be done, keeping Alex busy nearly every night. While Alex tells his co-workers he's living with three attractive women who are running him ragged, they don't know the real story; in the meantime, Alex is trying to charm Brainasium's beautiful new executive, Samantha (Linda Cardellini), while butting heads with the firm's space-case CEO Cheezle (Kevin Nealon) and J.P. (Joel David Moore), a teenage game designer who is no longer in touch with reality. Grandma's Boy was the first feature film from director Nicholaus Goossen(n)</desc>

But while he was inside, his wife Lynn found Jesus, and, after Sam gets stabbed, she urges him to join her at church. Sam subsequently has his own Damascene moment and starts life afresh, founding his own (legitimate) construction company. Before long he has also built his own church. But it's only after a trip to Sudan, where he witnesses the devastation wrought by the marauding Lord's Resistance Army, that he truly becomes driven. Relocating to the African country, he sets up a faith-based centre to care for victims of the LRA's violence and rape. And also takes up arms to literally fight the good fight...

    <title lang="en">The Pink Panther</title>
    <desc lang="en">The world's most inept detective returns to the screen in this modern slapstick comedy. France's come-from-behind victory in the World Cup soccer championships turns tragic when the team's coach, Yves Gulant (Jason Statham), is murdered during a post-game celebration. Gulant's girlfriend, pop star Xania (Beyoncé Knowles), was standing by his side as he was felled by a poisoned dart, and in the chaos that followed a diamond ring he gave her was stolen, which held one of the world's largest and most valuable jewels, known as "the Pink Panther." The media and the public demand that the killer be found out and brought to justice, and Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Kevin Kline) of the Paris Police pledges to put his best man on the case. However, somehow the astoundingly clumsy but consistently lucky Inspector Jacques Clouseau (Steve Martin) gets the assignment instead, and with his assistant, Gendarme Gilbert Ponton (Jean Reno), in tow, Clouseau follows a dizzying trail of clues from Paris to New York City as he attempts to recover the rare diamond and find the villains who killed Gulant. An updated variant on the Inspector Clouseau comedies that helped make Peter Sellers a major star in the United States, The Pink Panther also stars Emily Mortimer, Kristin Chenoweth, Roger Rees, and William Abadie; leading man Steve Martin also wrote the film's screenplay(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Pink Panther</title>
    <desc lang="en">The world's most inept detective returns to the screen in this modern slapstick comedy. France's come-from-behind victory in the World Cup soccer championships turns tragic when the team's coach, Yves Gulant (Jason Statham), is murdered during a post-game celebration. Gulant's girlfriend, pop star Xania (Beyoncé Knowles), was standing by his side as he was felled by a poisoned dart, and in the chaos that followed a diamond ring he gave her was stolen, which held one of the world's largest and most valuable jewels, known as "the Pink Panther." The media and the public demand that the killer be found out and brought to justice, and Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Kevin Kline) of the Paris Police pledges to put his best man on the case. However, somehow the astoundingly clumsy but consistently lucky Inspector Jacques Clouseau (Steve Martin) gets the assignment instead, and with his assistant, Gendarme Gilbert Ponton (Jean Reno), in tow, Clouseau follows a dizzying trail of clues from Paris to New York City as he attempts to recover the rare diamond and find the villains who killed Gulant. An updated variant on the Inspector Clouseau comedies that helped make Peter Sellers a major star in the United States, The Pink Panther also stars Emily Mortimer, Kristin Chenoweth, Roger Rees, and William Abadie; leading man Steve Martin also wrote the film's screenplay(n)</desc>

The pair get stuck into helping rescue the city's wild animals, with tasks including removing a fishhook from a wild turtle, and saving a possum stuck up a chimney.
