    <title lang="en">Undercover Brother</title>
    <desc lang="en">Undercover Brother began life as an animated series on the Internet. The satirical cartoon was created by novelist and screenwriter John Ridley (Three Kings) for the website /urbanentertainment.com. Ridley wrote the screenplay with Michael McCullers, co-writer of the Austin Powers sequels, and it was directed by Malcolm D. Lee (Spike Lee's cousin, and the writer/director of The Best Man). The film stars Eddie Griffin (of TV's Malcolm and Eddie) as Undercover Brother, he of the gold Cadillac convertible and huge Afro, who uses gadgets and disguises to steal from the rich and give to the poor. His activities are discovered by the B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D., a spy organization devoted to subverting The Man (Robert Trumbull) and his henchman, Mr. Feather (Chris Kattan), who use their power over the media to demean black people and destroy racial unity. The spy organization is run by The Chief (Chi McBride), who is constantly screaming at his subordinates. They include Sistah Girl (Aunjanue Ellis), a beautiful martial artist, Conspiracy Brother (Dave Chappelle), who sees white supremacist plots everywhere, and Smart Brother (Gary Anthony Williams, who provided the voice of Undercover Brother in the cartoon), who supplies the operatives with gadgets and information. When a popular black political figure, General Boutwell (Billy Dee Williams), calls a press conference, presumably to announce his presidential candidacy, and instead announces that he's opening a chain of fried chicken restaurants, the B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D. rightly suspects foul play, and recruits Undercover Brother to look into it. He goes undercover as an uptight buppie to work for The Man, but his cover is soon blown, and the seductive White She Devil (Denise Richards) is sent in to use her feminine wiles to destroy Undercover Brother(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Gran Torino</title>
    <desc lang="en">A racist Korean War veteran living in a crime-ridden Detroit neighborhood is forced to confront his own lingering prejudice when a troubled Hmong teen from his neighborhood attempts to steal his prized Gran Torino. Decades after the Korean War has ended, ageing veteran Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is still haunted by the horrors he witnessed on the battlefield. The two objects that matter most to Kowalski in life are the classic Gran Torino that represents his happier days working in a Ford assembly plant, and the M-1 rifle that saved his life countless times during combat. When Kowalski's teenage neighbor (Bee Vang) attempts to steal his Gran Torino as part of a gang initiation rite, the old man manages to catch the aspiring thief at the business end of his well-maintained semi-automatic rifle.

Ultimately, the feud is settled with a torrent of cold water and a well-calculated "traffic accident", but not before Col. Potter (Harry Morgan) has tackled the more serious issue of a suicidal patient.

Featuring contributions by singers Ian Gillan, Glenn Tipton, Lemmy, Bruce Dickinson and Rob Halford, guitarist Tony Iommi and keyboard player Jon Lord. Narrated by Nigel Planer.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Buddy Holly: Rave On</title>
    <desc lang="en">Rock 'n' roll started with Elvis, but some believe that pop music started with Buddy Holly and the Crickets. As a songwriter, Holly revolutionised the genre by introducing dynamic new rhythms and unpredictable melodies beyond its traditional blues roots. In his songs written and recorded in the late '50s, it is already possible to hear the beat group sound of the 1960s, and beyond. This documentary tells the story of Holly's tragically short life and career through interviews with those who knew him and worked with him. Contributors include Don McLean, Paul Anka, Don Everly, Hank Marvin and Bob Harris.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Nightmare Neighbour Next Door</title>
    <desc lang="en">Jessica's fresh start in Stockport was made easier by her next-door neighbour Daniel - until the arrival of an unexpected visitor revealed the truth about him. A doctor expected a few problems when she moved from the south of England to the north - but nothing could prepare her for the disruption caused by her neighbour's large extension, a redevelopment which took over her garden and, eventually, her life. Plus, the story of a man who was delighted when an old friend moved in next door - until he was accused of making a complaint about their driveway.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">(2008) Angelina Jolie, James McAvoy and Morgan Freeman star in this violent action adventure from Russian director Timur Bekmambetov (Nightwatch, Daywatch). The life of office worker Wesley Gibson (McAvoy) has been one of frustration, disappointment and anxiety; he has an overbearing boss, his girlfriend and his best friend are duplicitously having an affair, and he's on medication to calm his nerves. To top it all, he one day finds himself on the wrong end of an assassination attempt. Luckily, the agile, honed and lethal Fox (Jolie) is at hand to save his life. However, she also reveals that his recently deceased father was secretly a supremely skilled killer, and that it's her job to ensure that Wesley takes his place in the Fraternity, the mystical organisation overseen by Sloan (Freeman), which exists to rid the world of evil-doers. And so begins Wesley's journey to unlock his hitherto unsuspected innate deadly abilities and use them for good. The cinematography echoes the inventiveness of Bekmambetov's earlier movies and takes a Matrix-like delight in playing with the tempo and camera angles of the fight scenes(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In this sophomoric comedy, an immature twenty-something party animal must take over his father's multi-million dollar hotel business after his father retires, but first he must return to school. Billy Madison loves to drink beer, hang with his friends and play childish pranks. However, his father's retirement is forcing him to grow up. The filthy rich heir has never been ambitious; in fact, he bribed his way through school. To gain control of his father's company, the child-like Billy must cram 12 years of learning into 24 weeks. If he fails, the company reigns will be passed to his father's slimy aide. Naturally the aide wants Billy to fail and engineers many insidious plots(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Happy Gilmore</title>
    <desc lang="en">Adam Sandler's second popular starring vehicle after Billy Madison is a goofy lowbrow paean to golf, hockey, and the comic hysterics of its childlike star. In Happy Gilmore, Sandler plays the title character, a raw, determined, but ultimately untalented hockey player who keeps trying out for the pros. When Happy discovers his grandmother (Frances Bay) will lose her home if she doesn't fork over 270,000 dollars to the IRS, he tries to figure out how he can possibly scrounge up the cash. An idea strikes during a game of one-upmanship with a couple furniture movers stripping his grandmother's home: On his first-ever swing, he drives a golf ball farther than the movers have ever seen. Before long, he has transplanted the foul-mouthed, aggressive persona of the hockey rink to the links, winning an amateur tourney that earns him a spot on the pro tour. Throttling everyone from a helpless caddy to game show host Bob Barker during the course of his 90-day quest to amass prize money, Happy also wins the sport a legion of new fans with his in-your-face style. Guiding him on his quest is a whimsical retired pro who lost his hand to an alligator (Carl Weathers) and an attractive public relations woman charmed by Happy's antics (Julie Bowen). Opposing him, however, is sneering hotshot Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald), who will do anything to win his championship jacket and see Happy fail(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">A Simple Plan</title>
    <desc lang="en">Based on Scott B. Smith's bone-chilling 1993 novel, A Simple Plan is a bit of a departure for horror film director Sam Raimi. Instead of flying eyeballs and dancing corpses, A Simple Plan is a taut crime thriller in the vein of Joel Coen's Academy Award-winning Fargo. Set during the white winters of Minnesota, this story tells the eerie tale of Hank and Jacob Mitchell (played by Bill Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton) who, along with a buddy, find a downed single-engine plane buried in the snowy woods. Inside it is a decaying pilot and a bag carrying four million dollars in one-hundred-dollar bills. The men decide to hide the money until spring when the snow is melted and the plane is found. If no one notices the missing money at that time, they will split it and live a wealthy new life. A simple plan, right? Wrong. Much like Humphrey Bogart's The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, things can only get worse, as distrust and greed creep into the minds of the principals. They find it difficult to decide which one gets to hold the money -- and even more impossible to keep from dipping into the stash until spring. And so on. It also becomes increasingly tough to keep a secret of this magnitude. And if all this doesn't get moviegoers' brains working, it seems there are suspicious characters in town who just may be able to link them to the plane, forcing the more dangerous and bloody question of what to do with those people and how to cover their tracks(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">John Ford Goes to War</title>
    <desc lang="en">In this documentary centered on legendary filmmaker John Ford's cinematic contributions to Allied morale during World War II, actor/musician Kris Kristofferson narrates as the How Green Was My Valley director turns his back on Tinseltown in order to fulfill his patriotic duty. By the time the United States became involved in World War II, John Ford was already a film legend, but when Uncle Sam came calling the veteran filmmaker eagerly packed his bags and set his sites on the frontlines. Though Ford did sustain battlefield injuries during the production of the Oscar-winning documentary The Battle of Midway, the remarkable film endeared him to patriotic American audiences across the country and his next wartime effort, 1943's December 7th, proceeded to earn the filmmaker yet another Oscar. In addition to featuring footage from these and other, lesser-known wartime films from Ford, this documentary also offers an intimate look at the complex filmmaker and explores his remarkable legacy through both archive footage and interviews with such notable directors as Oliver Stone and Peter Bogdanovich(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Fortress</title>
    <desc lang="en">A glossy high-tech, futuristic sci-fi exterior does little to conceal the fact that this gory actioner is little more than a cliche-ridden prison movie--a movie that found tremendous popularity internationally. Set amidst an overpopulated, oppressed future U.S., it centers on the struggles of a defiant young couple who decide to have a second baby after the first dies. Unfortunately, the law states that each woman can only have one child. It is irrelevant whether the child survives or not. The couple attempts to make it safely out of the country, but they are captured and sentenced to spend three decades in the dreaded, corporate-owned Fortress, a grim place where lasers replace iron bars and inmates are controlled via radio-operated pain-inflicting intestinal devices. Incorrigible prisoners are forced to have their identities erased by a "mind wipe" machine. The prison is controlled by a sadistic cyborg warden and a robot army. The warden wants to make the woman's baby into a cyborg too. The warden also finds the wife very attractive. Meanwhile the husband begins making friends with his cellmate in hopes of finding a way to disable the surveillance system in time to save his wife and somehow escape(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Honeymoon Is Over. Season 3 opener starts in a Paris hotel room as Molly is packing up to leave. Mike has enjoyed France so much he's gone native (growing a little moustache and dressing like a French man) and doesn't want to leave. On the plane, we learn Molly is excited to get home and start their life together as a married couple, but Mike wants to travel the world. Molly wants to get back because she thinks Joyce, Victoria and Vince will have run amok without her there and Mike thinks Carl has probably fallen apart without him. As they're flying back, there's turbulence and scares the wanderlust out of Mike. Meanwhile, at home, Joyce, Victoria and Vince have enjoyed getting to do what they want and Carl has a "man-crush" on his temp partner who is uber-masculine(n)</desc>

Meanwhile, Carl gets jealous and overprotective when Christina's ex-husband, James, comes back into the picture.

    <desc lang="en">After six weeks of tough competition, the five remaining hopefuls enter the last week - four nights of culinary challenges after which one of them will be crowned MasterChef Champion. They begin by cooking a five-course dinner in memory of Winston Churchill at Cambridge University's Churchill College, trying to replicate a menu devised by leading chef Michael Caines. After that it's back to the kitchen to produce a dish inspired by a personal hero - and for one unlucky cook, this will be the last time they wear their MasterChef apron.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Blast From the Past</title>
    <desc lang="en">In 1962, Calvin Webber (Christopher Walken) was a brilliant but somewhat paranoid scientist living with his Donna Reed-esque wife, Helen (Sissy Spacek), in Los Angeles. In the midst of the Cuban Missile Crisis, a plane crashed into the Webber's yard. Mistaking the blast for "the big one," the Webbers moved into their elaborate bomb shelter to wait out the half-life of radioactive fallout. In the shelter, now a sort of time capsule, Calvin and Helen conceived and raised their son Adam (played as an adult by Brendan Fraser). For 35 years, Adam was raised on Jackie Gleason, Perry Como, and stories about life on the surface. Calvin taught his son about science, baseball, and communists while Mom taught Adam about dancing, good manners, and charming young ladies. Just in time, too, as Adam is sent to the surface to gather supplies and find a wife, preferably a nice, non-mutant girl from Pasadena with which to repopulate the world. Once this "fish out of water" story is set up, the fish, Adam, is set adrift in a sea of supermarkets and adult bookstores, but is soon caught by Eve Rustikov (Alicia Silverstone). Completely lost above ground, Adam enlists Eve's help to navigate his new world and find the supplies on his list. The literally sheltered Adam falls for this bitter, cynical, street-smart woman who grew up in a bleak Los Angeles with little use for love. Living with her gay roommate, Troy (Dave Foley), Eve has had her hopes chipped away by a long line of dead-end jobs and loser boyfriends. When the throwback Adam enters her life with his sunny disposition, seersucker jacket, and joy at seeing the sky, she can't help but fall in love(n)</desc>

Enter Jack Traven and the S.W.A.T. team who in a daring rescue save the elevator and shoot Payne. Unfortunately Payne didn't die and later tells Traven his newest scheme: he has wired a Santa Monica bus, travelling during morning rush hour on the freeway, to explode if it goes under 50 mph.

Annie, recently arrested for speeding, replaces the driver. Now, under pressure from both passengers and headquarters, it is up to Jack to disarm the bomb. After a spectacular scene where the bus jumps a 50 foot gap in an overpass, the police guide it to the airport and disarm it. But Payne is still busy at work.

In the midst of the Cuban Missile Crisis, a plane crashed into the Webber's yard. Mistaking the blast for "the big one," the Webbers moved into their elaborate bomb shelter to wait out the half-life of radioactive fallout. In the shelter, now a sort of time capsule, Calvin and Helen conceived and raised their son Adam (played as an adult by Brendan Fraser). For 35 years, Adam was raised on Jackie Gleason, Perry Como, and stories about life on the surface.

Getting together a couple of accomplices -- Phyllis (Geena Davis), who admires Grimm for his audacity, and Loomis (Randy Quaid), a follower to Grimm's leader since grade school -- Grimm decides to rob a bank, pocket the money, get out of town and take off to tropical splendor. Dressing in a clown suit, Grimm devises a unique way to rob a bank -- taking a group of hostages at the bank and inviting the police to surround the bank. Amazingly, although pursued by a police chief (Jason Robards), the trio manage to pull off the robbery. However, the problems really start when they try to get from the bank to the airport -- which proves to be more difficult than the robbery(n)</desc>

As the film begins, Kermit the Frog and Fozzie Bear are reporters who have failed to bag a story of a London jewel heist, which happened under their watch. The real criminals managed to escape and frame Miss Piggy as the thief. Kermit, Fozzie and the Great Gonzo set out on a mission to solve the mystery and track down the criminals who stole the Baseball Diamond. There are fewer star cameos and songs in The Great Muppet Caper than in The Muppet Movie, although appearances from John Cleese and Charles Grodin are particularly memorable(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Last Mimzy</title>
    <desc lang="en">An intergalactic package discovered on the beach holds a myriad of fantastic discoveries for siblings Noah and Emma Wilder in The Last Mimzy, studio head-turned-director Bob Shaye's wondrous sci-fi fantasy parable. The children stumble onto their discovery amid a trip to the family beach house, and find inside of the crate strange crystals that Emma levitates with her mind, as well as the Mimzy -- a stuffed bunny with a built-in supercomputer that advances its possessor's brain by great leaps and bounds by whispering into the person's ear. Meanwhile, via interaction with the box and its contents, Noah gains the ability to converse with spiders and instructs them to build miniature bridges. He also etches complex Tibetan mandalas, and somehow manages to black out half of Seattle. The children naturally keep these happenings (and the box) from their mom and dad (Joely Richardson and Timothy Hutton), but in time the kids set their sights higher and embark on correcting huge problems that cannot be missed. Rainn Wilson (The Office) co-stars as the children's hippie science teacher; New Age expert Bruce Joel Rubin (Ghost, Jacob's Ladder) and Toby Emmerich co-authored the script, adapting the 1943 short story Mimsy Were the Borogoves, by Lewis Padgett(n)</desc>

Before long, their trail of clues has led them to sleazy lawyer Marcus Baptiste (Christian Slater), who is currently caught up in some shady business dealings with the mysterious and powerful Robert Nkomo Morel (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) that could implicate some serious power players in Washington, D.C. Now each new move that Bonomo and Kwon make could be their last, and as the cop does his best to stay on the right side of the law, the killer uses the only tactics he knows to get results. But even if they manage to get their man, that doesn't change the fact that they'll have to deal with one another once they've taken down their target(n)</desc>

Amelia's ties to the deceased actress are unclear, but as other members of the porn industry turn up dead, March and Healy's investigation reveals a much bigger conspiracy than the duo could have ever anticipated.

    <title lang="en">Fall to Grace</title>
    <desc lang="en">In 2004, New Jersey governor Jim McGreevey was struggling with his public image and the political fallout from allegations of sexual harassment when he resigned from office after making a surprising revelation -- that he was "a Gay American" who was in a relationship with a man despite being married to a woman. McGreevey's marriage and political career were soon over, and outside of the public eye, he began following a different path. In the documentary Fall To Grace, filmmaker Alexandra Pelosi offers a look into the life of Jim McGreevey eight years after he left office: a man of renewed religious faith, he serves as a counselor, mentor, and spiritual advisor to the female prisoners at the Hudson County Correctional Center, and is in a stable, long-term relationship with another man as he strives to serve those who need help rather than chasing power and privilege. Fall Into Grace was produced for the HBO premium cable network, and received its world premiere at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Director Christopher Nolan follows up his breakthrough sophomore film Memento with this remake of a stylish Norwegian thriller. Al Pacino stars as Detective Will Dormer, a Los Angeles Police Department legend who temporarily escapes an internal affairs investigation that may ruin his career by traveling to Nightmute, AK, the remote site of a murder that has the local authorities flummoxed. Along with his partner, Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan), and the small town's wide-eyed rookie investigator, Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank), the exhausted Dormer probes the brutal slaying of a teenage girl who was rumored to have a secret lover. A clever ruse quickly lures the killer into a police trap, but the suspect escapes and a tragic accident at the scene leaves Dormer at the mercy of the murderer, a pulp crime novelist named Walter Finch (Robin Williams). As Finch plays a dangerous game of extortion with Dormer, the detective's mental health deteriorates rapidly from guilt over his complicity in a crime and sleep deprivation compounded by the lack of darkness in the land of the midnight sun. Meanwhile, the bright and dogged Ellie continues putting the pieces of a complex puzzle together despite Dormer's skillful attempts to lead the investigation toward the right suspect, but away from his own malfeasance. Insomnia co-stars Paul Dooley, Nicky Katt, Maura Tierney, and Jonathan Jackson(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">My Big Fat Greek Wedding</title>
    <desc lang="en">One woman's rocky road to the altar gets played for laughs in this comedy, adapted from the one-woman off-Broadway show written by and starring Nia Vardalos. Toula (Vardalos) is a Greek-American woman who is in her early thirties and single, with no immediate prospects of changing that status any time soon. This bothers Toula a bit, but not half as much as it distresses her mother (Lainie Kazan) and father (Michael Constantine), who want to send her to Greece in hopes of finding a husband in the old country. Toula isn't interested in leaving the country to find a man, but since she works in the family business -- a Greek restaurant in Chicago called Dancing Zorba's -- she has to hear about it whether she likes it or not. One day, after seeing a handsome stranger in the restaurant and not having the courage to talk to him, Toula decides she needs a bit of self-improvement. Despite her dad's misgivings, Toula signs up for a night-school class studying computers, trades in her glasses for contact lenses, gets a different job at a travel agency, and spruces herself up with a new look and a new attitude. To her very pleasant surprise, she once again encounters the handsome stranger, who soon asks her out on a date. Schoolteacher Ian Miller (John Corbett) is seemingly perfect -- he's tall, handsome, smart, good-natured, and soon in love with Toula -- except for two little things: he's not Greek, and he's a vegetarian, both of which horrify Toula's family. When Ian pops the question (and Toula says yes), the bride-to-be has to negotiate a reasonably peaceful meeting between Ian's upper-class parents and her own working-class extended family. There's also the matter of the wedding, which Toula's mother is planning around the notion that quantity IS quality. My Big Fat Greek Wedding also features Ian Gomez (Vardalos' real-life husband), Louis Mandylor, Andrea Martin, and Joey Fatone (from the pop group *NSYNC). Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson helped produce the film through the auspices of their production company, Playtone(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Revenge of the Nerds</title>
    <desc lang="en">Revenge of the Nerds is the juvenile sex comedy perhaps most synonymous with the 1980s, alternating gags and scantily clad women with a power to the underdogs mentality that prompted three sequels. The handsome jocks of Alpha Beta, led by Stan (Ted McGinley), run Adams College, which means that when they burn down their house after a stunt involving grain alcohol and an open flame, they kick a bunch of socially inept freshman out of their dorm and into the gymnasium. But sleeping on cots is only the beginning of their worries, as the so-called nerds soon become the target of pranks by Alpha Beta, assisted by Betty (Julie Montgomery) and the gorgeous gals of Pi Delta Pi. Instead of taking the abuse sitting down, the displaced freshman, led by Gilbert (Anthony Edwards) and Lewis (Robert Carradine), buy a ramshackle house, affiliate themselves with the only national chapter who will take them (the all-black Lambda Lambda Lambda), and use their superior intellect to launch a counterstrike. The bespectacled but loveable geeks set up surveillance cameras in the Pi bathroom and put liquid heat in the athletes' jock straps, then draft a sister sorority of misfits (Omega Mu) to strengthen their resources. The frats quickly become bitter rivals, and the goal is to win the annual fraternity decathlon, which involves such feats as a burping contest and a go-cart race, with bragging rights (and perhaps peace of mind) at stake. Look for John Goodman and future thirtysomething cast member Timothy Busfield in small roles, and expect a torrent of nasal laughter(n)</desc>

Later, Joanna travels to the Kiso Valley to walk the Nakasendo Way, an ancient route that once linked Tokyo to Kyoto, a place best known for that most famous of Japanese traditions, the Geisha.(n)</desc>

Afraid of being deserted, he tags along with Manfred, an embittered mammoth who's decided he'd rather head north. After stumbling across a human camp that's under attack by a pride of sabre-toothed tigers and narrowly saving a baby, they're joined by Diego, a sabretooth who convinces them he can help return the child by tracking the humans. However, he's actually a member of the same pride - and is plotting to guide them into an ambush. Can Manny and Sid find the baby's father and avoid the frozen weather? Or will Diego's plan mean they never make it? Also featuring the voice of Jack Black(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The three petrolheads demonstrate their love of small cars with a trip to Ukraine. Jeremy Clarkson chooses a Volkswagen Up for the journey, while Richard Hammond takes a Ford Fiesta and James May opts for a Dacia Sandero. On their adventure, the trio absorb the history of the Crimean Peninsula, including a visit to an old submarine pen - but the carefree exploration looks likely to become a chore when Jeremy, Richard and James are challenged to a long drive north through the expansive country, during which they must combat serious boredom. And as if that wasn't arduous enough, a new task is set when they arrive in Kiev - a trip into the wasteland of Chernobyl. This edition also features a track test of the Danish Zenvo ST1 supercar and James Blunt returns for another drive in the Reasonably Priced Car.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">As their survival hangs in the balance, the men lose patience with those they feel are not doing their fair share, while island life takes its toll on the youngest castaway, 21-year-old call-centre worker Ryan, who has become exhausted and isolated from the group. In harsh, unforgiving heat, he heads off alone in search of food, but without a supply of water, he finds himself lost and in danger. With Ryan's actions now affecting everyone else, the men have a choice. Do they bring him back into the fold?.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">David Attenborough's Conquest of the Skies</title>
    <sub-title lang="en">First to Fly.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The veteran naturalist examines the world of flight, travelling across the globe to chart the evolutionary story of those creatures who seemingly defy the rules of gravity by taking to the air. Initially focusing on insects, Attenborough meets a descendant of the dragonfly, before examining the Atlas beetle, which tends to restrict flight to times when it needs a mate or a fresh supply of food. More aesthetically pleasing is a group of beautiful tropical butterflies, followed by an in-depth study into the blow fly - the jet fighter of insects.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The veteran naturalist visits the jungles of Borneo to meet creatures that like to glide through life - the harlequin tree frog and the little-known colugo - often referred to, incorrectly, as a flying lemur. He also has a CGI-assisted encounter with the first true vertebrate flyer, the pterosaur, receives a flying lesson from a small flock of swans at Loch Lomond in Scotland and encounters the planet's largest species of bat.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Triumph.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The veteran naturalist turns his attention to creatures that dominate the skies today. He begins with the vast bird family, watching a group of vultures as they go scavenging and some peregrine falcons dive bombing for their prey. He then moves on to the floating forests of Ecuador to find out what makes the humble hummingbird tick, before ending his journey at the Gomantong bat caves of Borneo - a place he first filmed in 1972 - witnessing a mass exodus of the creatures.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal play Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist, two young cowboys paired up for a job tending sheep on a Wyoming mountain. As the days go by, their relationship develops until, after a heavy night drinking whisky, they make passionate love. Initially denying the attraction each feels for the other, they go their separate ways at the end of the job. Both marry and have children but meet regularly to slake their undying passion for each other, living desperate, unfulfilled lives between each meeting. But then tragedy strikes. Ang Lee's Oscar-winning drama is a bold, emotional story of a passion that cannot be denied but must be hidden from a world that will only condemn it(n)</desc>

Looking for help, the four happen upon the farmhouse of an elderly couple, Elvin (Richard Little) and May (Barbara Wilhide), which is located next to a huge barn. Elvin and May have already become lost in the darkness of the barn, and soon two of the lost travelers are suffering the same fate as they search for friendly strangers. However, while they can barely see a hand in front of their face, they discover they're not alone in the barn, which has become home to a huge swarm of bloodthirsty bats.

    <title lang="en">Doom</title>
    <desc lang="en">One of the most popular and influential video games ever makes its way to the big screen in this sci-fi thriller. A coalition of Earth's scientific and military interests have established a research colony called Olduvai on the planet Mars, but one day all communication from the outpost stops and no one can tell what has happened -- though the final messages suggest it's not good. Believing foul play may have overtaken Olduvai's crew, the Rapid Response Tactical Squad, a team of specially trained military personnel, are deployed to investigate the situation and, if necessary, eliminate the invaders. But Sarge (Dwayne Johnson, aka The Rock) and Reaper (Karl Urban), leaders of the RRTS team, soon discover the situation is far more grim than they could have imagined. An experiment on Olduvai has very literally opened a portal to Hades, and a variety of savage and demonic creatures have overtaken the colony. Now the RRTS must seal off Olduvai, close off any access to Earth, and exterminate the satanic beasts before they can kill again. Doom also stars Rosamund Pike (as Dr. Grimm), Dexter Fletcher, Ben Daniels, and Deobia Oparei(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Tyler Perry's Diary of a Mad Black Woman</title>
    <desc lang="en">A woman has to learn how to love and trust men all over again in this comedy drama. Helen McCarter (Kimberly Elise) would seem to have it all -- she's been married for 18 years to Charles (Steve Harris), and over the course of their time together, he's become one of Atlanta's most successful attorneys. But despite wealth and prestige, things are not as they should be at the McCarter home, and on their anniversary, Charles drops a bombshell on Helen -- he's divorcing her for another woman. Escorted out of the house with nowhere to go, Helen moves in with her grandmother Madea (Tyler Perry), a sassy woman with no shortage of opinions and a gun that she's not afraid to use. As Madea helps Helen get back on her feet emotionally, the divorcée makes the acquaintance of Orlando (Shemar Moore), a handsome man who is obviously attracted to her. But after her experiences with Charles, Helen isn't sure if she's ready to trust a man again. Diary of a Mad Black Woman was adapted from the popular stage play by Tyler Perry, who also plays several roles in the film, most prominently Madea; it marked the first feature-film credit for successful music video director Darren R.

When the boy witnesses Sonny commit a murder, he honors the code of the streets and refuses to tell the cops. Sonny befriends him and introduces the impressionable youngster to the creature comforts that mob connections can bring. But though he idolizes Sonny, the boy loves and respects his decent, honest father. It takes a major tragedy for the 17-year-old boy (now played by Lillo Brancato) to decide his true course in life(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Robert De Niro makes his directorial debut with this expanded adaptation of Chazz Palminteri's one-character play. De Niro's role of Lorenzo Anello, an Italian-America bus driver, is secondary to the part of his son Calogero. The top dog in Calogero's Bronx neighborhood is flashy "wiseguy" Sonny. When the boy witnesses Sonny commit a murder, he honors the code of the streets and refuses to tell the cops. Sonny befriends him and introduces the impressionable youngster to the creature comforts that mob connections can bring. But though he idolizes Sonny, the boy loves and respects his decent, honest father. It takes a major tragedy for the 17-year-old boy (now played by Lillo Brancato) to decide his true course in life(n)</desc>

Not used to balancing his new life with his old, Todd mistakenly invites family and friends from his old neighborhood to his multi-million-dollar house for a cookout on the same day of an important endorsement interview. Though his extravagant family cookouts were welcome at his old digs, Todd's stuffy new neighbors -- particularly the conservative Republican Judge Halsted Crowley (Danny Glover) -- are less than thrilled with the arrival of Todd's massive family. Complicating the situation further is the eccentric neighborhood security guard (Queen Latifah), who takes on the heady assignment of ensuring that none of the private community's rules are broken, as well as two thugs who, determined to get an autographed pair of sneakers, hold up the cookout at gunpoint. Directed by Lance Rivera, The Cookout also features performances from Ja Rule, Eve, Farrah Fawcett, and Jonathan Silverman(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Bank Job</title>
    <desc lang="en">Jason Statham and Saffron Burrows star in director Roger Donaldson's cinematic account of the true-life 1971 London bank robbery that baffled the authorities and fascinated the public. Terry Leather (Statham) was a small-time car dealer who was trying to leave his shady past behind and start a family. Though he'd never been involved in any major crimes, he wasn't exactly on the straight and narrow his whole life either. Martine Love (Burrows) is a beautiful model from Terry's old neighborhood who knows that her former neighbor is no angel. When Martine proposes a foolproof plan to rob a Baker Street bank, Terry recognizes the danger but realizes this may be the opportunity of a lifetime. As the operation gets underway, the resourceful band of thieves burrows its way into a safe-deposit vault at the Lloyds Bank in Marylebone, quickly hitting a literal treasure trove of cash and priceless gems. But while the crew did know that the safe-deposit boxes contained millions in riches, they didn't realize that they also contained secrets that implicated everyone from London's most notorious underworld gangsters to powerful government figures, and even the Royal Family. Though the crime would make headlines all across Britain for several days after the fact, a government gag order eventually brought all reporting on the case to an immediate halt. Could it be that the most notorious bank robbers in recent memory were actually the most innocent people involved in this scandalous crime?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In this comic drama about fame, sports, and small-town life, Mystery, Alaska is a small town in one of the least accessible parts of the coldest state in the union. It's a town where everyone knows each other and there isn't much to do. In places like this, small things tend to become very important, and in Mystery, the one thing that keeps everyone sane is hockey. Most of the men of Mystery are obsessive hockey fans, and a local hockey league has sprung up, with pools of neighborhood talent facing off on the ice every week. When a national sports magazine does a story on the hockey fans of Mystery, Alaska, someone at the National Hockey League gets an idea for a publicity stunt: send the New York Rangers to Mystery to play the local all-stars in a nationally televised game. Most of the locals are thrilled; the game will give the people of Mystery a chance to bask in the limelight and make their sleepy town a household word. On the other hand, in a small town where everyone knows everyone else's secrets, this event could cause everyone to start airing their dirty laundry in public, with the whole world watching. Mystery, Alaska was directed by Jay Roach, who enjoyed considerable success with the two Austin Powers films, and stars Russell Crowe as John Biebe, Mary McCormack as his wife Donna, Burt Reynolds as Judge Burns, and Lolita Davidovich as Mary Jane(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Deep Impact</title>
    <desc lang="en">Mimi Leder (The Peacemaker) directed this science-fiction disaster drama about the possible extinction of human life after a comet is discovered headed toward Earth with the collision only one year away. Ambitious MSNBC reporter Jenny Lerner (Tea Leoni) stumbles onto the story, prompting a White House press conference. United States President Beck (Morgan Freeman) announces the government's solution: a team of astronauts will travel to the comet and destroy it. The team leader aboard the spaceship Messiah is Spurgeon Tanner (Robert Duvall), who was once the last man to walk on the moon. However, the mission fails, splitting off a chunk of the comet, now due to land in the Atlantic with the impact sending a 350-foot tidal wave flooding 650 miles inland, destroying New York and other cities. The larger part of the comet, hitting in Canada, will trigger an E.L.E. (Extinction Level Event), not unlike a "nuclear winter" as dust clouds block out the sun and bring life to an end. President Beck reveals Plan B: a cavernous underground retreat constructed to hold one million Americans, with most to be selected through a national lottery. Since teenage amateur astronomer Leo Biederman (Elijah Wood) discovered the comet, his family gets a pass to enter the cave, but his girlfriend Sarah (Leelee Sobieski) and her parents will be left behind. Meanwhile, still in space, Spurgeon Tanner devises a plan for a kamikaze-styled operation that could possibly save the Earth.

    <title lang="en">Clerks II</title>
    <desc lang="en">You can take the clerks out of the Quick Stop, but you just can't take the Quick Stop out of the clerks as Dante (Brian O'Halloran) and Randall (Jeff Anderson) prove in this long-awaited sequel to Kevin Smith's breakthrough comedy. Years after we last saw them, Dante is still toiling behind the counter at a New Jersey convenience store and Randall is still annoying customers at the video shop next door -- or at least they are until a fire burns down the strip mall, forcing Dante and Randall to look for work. Times are tough, and the guys find themselves embracing the ultimate indignity as they take jobs at Mooby's, a fast-food outlet where the burgers are advertised as "udderly delicious." While Randall's snarky attitude toward the public remains unchanged, Dante is trying to make the best of the situation as he plans to marry his fiancée, Emma (Jennifer Schwalbach Smith), and move to Florida. However, Dante's plans are complicated when he falls for Becky (Rosario Dawson), a funny and tart-tongued woman who happens to be his boss at Mooby's. Lurking about in the background, as always, are Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith), who for good or ill have changed even less with the passage of time than Dante and Randall. Clerks II also features Wanda Sykes, Ethan Suplee, and Trevor Fehrman, with cameo appearances from Kevin Smith regulars Ben Affleck and Jason Lee(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Deep Impact</title>
    <desc lang="en">Mimi Leder (The Peacemaker) directed this science-fiction disaster drama about the possible extinction of human life after a comet is discovered headed toward Earth with the collision only one year away. Ambitious MSNBC reporter Jenny Lerner (Tea Leoni) stumbles onto the story, prompting a White House press conference. United States President Beck (Morgan Freeman) announces the government's solution: a team of astronauts will travel to the comet and destroy it. The team leader aboard the spaceship Messiah is Spurgeon Tanner (Robert Duvall), who was once the last man to walk on the moon. However, the mission fails, splitting off a chunk of the comet, now due to land in the Atlantic with the impact sending a 350-foot tidal wave flooding 650 miles inland, destroying New York and other cities. The larger part of the comet, hitting in Canada, will trigger an E.L.E. (Extinction Level Event), not unlike a "nuclear winter" as dust clouds block out the sun and bring life to an end. President Beck reveals Plan B: a cavernous underground retreat constructed to hold one million Americans, with most to be selected through a national lottery. Since teenage amateur astronomer Leo Biederman (Elijah Wood) discovered the comet, his family gets a pass to enter the cave, but his girlfriend Sarah (Leelee Sobieski) and her parents will be left behind. Meanwhile, still in space, Spurgeon Tanner devises a plan for a kamikaze-styled operation that could possibly save the Earth.

    <desc lang="en">You can take the clerks out of the Quick Stop, but you just can't take the Quick Stop out of the clerks as Dante (Brian O'Halloran) and Randall (Jeff Anderson) prove in this long-awaited sequel to Kevin Smith's breakthrough comedy. Years after we last saw them, Dante is still toiling behind the counter at a New Jersey convenience store and Randall is still annoying customers at the video shop next door -- or at least they are until a fire burns down the strip mall, forcing Dante and Randall to look for work. Times are tough, and the guys find themselves embracing the ultimate indignity as they take jobs at Mooby's, a fast-food outlet where the burgers are advertised as "udderly delicious." While Randall's snarky attitude toward the public remains unchanged, Dante is trying to make the best of the situation as he plans to marry his fiancée, Emma (Jennifer Schwalbach Smith), and move to Florida. However, Dante's plans are complicated when he falls for Becky (Rosario Dawson), a funny and tart-tongued woman who happens to be his boss at Mooby's. Lurking about in the background, as always, are Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith), who for good or ill have changed even less with the passage of time than Dante and Randall. Clerks II also features Wanda Sykes, Ethan Suplee, and Trevor Fehrman, with cameo appearances from Kevin Smith regulars Ben Affleck and Jason Lee(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Deliver Us From Eva</title>
    <desc lang="en">Three men discover that meddling in their sister-in-law's love life only makes their own lives more complicated in this romantic comedy. Eva Dandridge (Gabrielle Union) developed a sense of responsibility early on in life, when after the death of her parents she was left to care for her three younger sisters, Kareenah (Essence Atkins), Bethany (Robinne Lee), and Jacqui (Meagan Good). All four of the Dandridge sisters have grown up to be attractive, intelligent, and successful; Kareenah is happily married to Tim (Mel Jackson), while Bethany is engaged to Michael (Duane Martin), and Jacqui is going steady with Darrell (Dartanyan Edmonds). However, Eva still watches over her siblings like a hawk, and while her sisters love Eva dearly, Tim, Michael, and Darrell wish their sister-in-law would stay out of their business. The guys decide that if Eva had a boyfriend, she might be less interested in running other people's lives, and they turn to Ray (LL Cool J), a notorious ladies' man, for help. Ray is short on cash, so the guys make him a deal -- they'll give him 5,000 dollars to romance Eva, sweep her off her feet, and then dump her a few weeks later. Ray agrees, and while getting past her no-nonsense demeanor takes some doing, before long she's head over heels for him. However, Ray unexpectedly finds himself falling in love with Eva, and Eva, when offered a job in another town, decides to stay on to be with Ray. Even worse, the other Dandridge sisters are so impressed with the romantic Ray that they start demanding a bit more TLC from their own men(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Deliver Us From Eva</title>
    <desc lang="en">Three men discover that meddling in their sister-in-law's love life only makes their own lives more complicated in this romantic comedy. Eva Dandridge (Gabrielle Union) developed a sense of responsibility early on in life, when after the death of her parents she was left to care for her three younger sisters, Kareenah (Essence Atkins), Bethany (Robinne Lee), and Jacqui (Meagan Good). All four of the Dandridge sisters have grown up to be attractive, intelligent, and successful; Kareenah is happily married to Tim (Mel Jackson), while Bethany is engaged to Michael (Duane Martin), and Jacqui is going steady with Darrell (Dartanyan Edmonds). However, Eva still watches over her siblings like a hawk, and while her sisters love Eva dearly, Tim, Michael, and Darrell wish their sister-in-law would stay out of their business. The guys decide that if Eva had a boyfriend, she might be less interested in running other people's lives, and they turn to Ray (LL Cool J), a notorious ladies' man, for help. Ray is short on cash, so the guys make him a deal -- they'll give him 5,000 dollars to romance Eva, sweep her off her feet, and then dump her a few weeks later. Ray agrees, and while getting past her no-nonsense demeanor takes some doing, before long she's head over heels for him. However, Ray unexpectedly finds himself falling in love with Eva, and Eva, when offered a job in another town, decides to stay on to be with Ray. Even worse, the other Dandridge sisters are so impressed with the romantic Ray that they start demanding a bit more TLC from their own men(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Scoop</title>
    <desc lang="en">Both laughs and thrills are on the masthead in this comedy drama about a would-be reporter written and directed by Woody Allen. Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson) is an American journalism student who travels to England to visit friends. While in London, she attends a magic show where magician Sid "Splendini" Waterman (Woody Allen) brings her on-stage as part of a trick in which he makes her disappear. However, while waiting to be "de-materialized," she's visited by the ghost of a murdered reporter (Ian McShane), who passes along the scoop of the decade. The spirit claims that Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman), the wealthy and handsome son of a well-known aristocrat, is leading a double life as "the Tarot Card Killer," a serial murderer who has been terrifying the nation and eluding police. With the magician's help, Jane begins investigating the story and is able to piece together some incriminating evidence against Lyman. However, the more she learns, the more dangerous her investigation becomes -- especially when she falls into a romance with the suspected killer. Scoop was Woody Allen's second consecutive film with leading lady Scarlett Johansson, after the critically acclaimed Match Point; it was also Allen's second feature to be shot in Great Britain(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Kung Fu Hustle</title>
    <desc lang="en">The work of international superstar Stephen Chow, Kung Fu Hustle is a humorous, special-effects-filled, action-packed martial arts epic set in early '40s China. A bumbling thief named Sing (Stephen Chow) desires to be the toughest member of the dreaded gangster hit squad known as The Axe Gang, but to completely join the gang he has to commit murder. When Sing attempts to rob a crowded run-down apartment complex known as Pig Sty Alley, the locals begin to defend themselves with some high-flying kung fu skills, and a tiny war erupts between the local masters and the axe-wielding gang. After the gang busts the ancient kung fu king known as The Beast (Leung Siu Lung) out of jail, tensions reach a boiling point as Pig Sty Alley's landlady (Yuen Qiu) leads an all-out attack against the gang and Sing discovers his true heroic fate. Kung Fu Hustle, which set box-office records across Asia during its December 2004 release, also stars Yuen Wah and Xing Yu, and features fight choreography by legendary masters of martial arts cinema Yuen Woo Ping and Sammo Hung(n)</desc>

Robert Axle (Kevin Spacey) built a multi-million-dollar business out of selling household gadgets through television infomercials, and managed to alienate nearly everyone around him when fame and wealth turned him into an arrogant loudmouth. When one of Axle's products turns out to be dangerous and causes several thousand customers to lose a finger, he loses his fortune and spends eight years in prison for gross negligence. Back on the street, Axle is broke but determined to find a way back to the top, though he's just a bit more humble than he used to be and wants to win back the love of his daughter, Claire (Camilla Belle), whom he neglected as a child, and his ex-wife (Virginia Madsen). Things go badly for Axle on his first day working at a big-box discount store, and he's left with little alternative than to ask Claire to let him stay with her; she and her roommate, Fibbi (Heather Graham), aren't so sure this is a good idea, but they grudgingly agree and end up helping Axle in his bid to redeem himself. Father of Invention also stars Johnny Knoxville, Craig Robinson, and Michael Rosenbaum(n)</desc>

In the New Mexico Territory, ex-slave Sgt. Wyatt (Danny Glover) and the Buffalo soldiers arrest Captain Draper (Robert Knott) and other Texas Rangers, but politics mean the Rangers are quietly freed later. Back at Fort Craig, Wyatt reports to anti-black General Pike (Tom Bower) and Col. Grierson (Bob Gunton), a white responsible for assembling and supporting the black regiment. A search is underway for Indian chief Victorio (Harrison Lowe). Indian prophet Nana (Chesley Wilson) is tortured in an effort to get him to reveal Victorio's whereabouts. Determining that Victorio is at Rattlesnake Springs, the Buffalo Soldiers head in that direction for a confrontation. Filmed in the desert of Arizona's Cochise County, Buffalo Soldiers premiered December 7, 1997 on TNT(n)</desc>

However, before he can do so, his boss Jimmy Price asks him to track down the missing daughter of another gangster, Eddie Temple, and as Temple's of an even nastier temperament than Price it's not a request he can easily refuse. And once he embarks on his task, complications begin to stack upon each other in much the manner of the confection that gives the film its title - though rather than some lovely sponge, cream and berries, this one consists of brutal henchmen, drug deals gone bad and violent bloodletting(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Layer Cake</title>
    <desc lang="en">Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels producer Matthew Vaughn kicked off his directorial career with this crime thriller starring Daniel Craig, Sienna Miller and Michael Gambon. Craig plays an unnamed gentleman drug dealer (well, all things are relative in his line of work) who, landed with an astonishingly lucrative job, spies his opportunity to retire relatively unscathed from the business. However, before he can do so, his boss Jimmy Price asks him to track down the missing daughter of another gangster, Eddie Temple, and as Temple's of an even nastier temperament than Price it's not a request he can easily refuse. And once he embarks on his task, complications begin to stack upon each other in much the manner of the confection that gives the film its title - though rather than some lovely sponge, cream and berries, this one consists of brutal henchmen, drug deals gone bad and violent bloodletting(n)</desc>

Jimmy and his trophy wife, Sarina (Carmen Electra), also have a large family of eight children, and Jimmy and Tom seem intent upon one-upping each other at every opportunity. As the tensions mount, the Baker family and the Murtaugh clan face off in a not-so-good-natured series of family games to determine which of the parents have the greater bragging rights. In addition to Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt, the actors playing the 12 Baker children from the 2003 film return for Cheaper by the Dozen 2, including Hilary Duff, Piper Perabo, Tom Welling, and Kevin Schmidt(n)</desc>

Before long, he is receiving broadcasts from the 1930s and 1940s -- live broadcasts, not reruns. Having opened a window to the past, Ed desperately tries to correct several mistakes he's made in life. Scripted by Charles Beaumont from a story by OCee Ritch, "Static" was one of six videotaped Twilight Zone episodes and was originally telecast March 10, 1961 (and yes, that voice emanating from Ed's old-time radio does belong to future Hogan's Heroes star Bob Crane)(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">G.I. Joe: Retaliation</title>
    <desc lang="en">The Joes reteam to prevent Cobra from achieving total world domination in this sequel that picks up shortly after the events of G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra. The Nanomite threat has been neutralized, and the U.S. government has imprisoned Cobra Commander and Destro in an inescapable subterranean prison. When the leader of Pakistan is assassinated, the U.S. president (Jonathan Pryce) calls on the Joes to secure Pakistan's nuclear warheads before they fall into enemy hands. In the wake of successfully completing their mission, however, the Joes are decimated in a devastating surprise attack. When the smoke clears, Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson), Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki), and Flint (D.J. Cotrona) are the sole survivors. They're convinced that something is amiss in the White House, and as Lady Jaye theorizes that an imposter is pretending to be the commander in chief, bad guys Storm Shadow (Lee Byung-hun) and Firefly (Ray Stevenson) team up to break Cobra Commander (Luke Bracey) out of prison. Later, as Storm Shadow retreats into the mountains to recover from burns incurred in the extraction, Snake Eyes (Ray Park) and Jinx (Elodie Yung) manage to capture the elusive white ninja, in the process discovering a shocking secret about his past and learning that Zartan (Arnold Vosloo), posing as the president, has called an international summit to discuss nuclear disarmament in order to bring the leaders of the world to their knees before the diabolical Cobra Commander. Now, as Cobra holds the entire globe hostage with a revolutionary new weapon placed on satellites orbiting the planet, it's up to the Joes and a trustworthy old friend to save the day(n)</desc>

In this elaborate musical fantasy, Peg (Katey Sagal) dreams that she is Princess Scarlet, the captive of fierce pirate Captain Courage, who bears a striking resemblance to Peg's husband Al (Ed O'Neill). As things develop, Captain Courage emerges the hero of the piece by rescuing Scarlet from rival pirate Rubio the Cruel (played by the Bundys' ex-neighbor Steve Rhoades [David Garrison]), so named for his murderous renditions of popular show tunes. Also appearing in Peg's dream are her children Bud (David Faustino) as hunchbacked first mate Fluvio and Kelly (Christina Applegate) as a very confused navigator, not to mention Peg's neighbors Jefferson D'Arcy (Ted McGinley) as Prince Paco and Marcy Darcy (Amanda Bearse) as a cabin...uh...boy. This episode marks the final appearance of child actor Shane Sweet as Seven (and none too soon, according to the series' fans!)(n)</desc>

He ends up taking Chris (voice of Seth Green) on a fishing trip with his neighbors, Joe (voice of Patrick Warburton) and Cleveland (voice of Mike Henry) and their children. Cleveland is also eager to get away as his wife is having a visit from her "Aunt Flo." "Loretta likes to personify her menses in humorous ways," he needlessly explains. On the disastrous trip ("All we caught was a tire, a boot, a tin can, and this book of clichés"), Joe criticizes Peter's parenting skills, and says he's turning Chris into a slacker. Peter responds by getting Chris a job shagging golf balls at a driving range. But Peter is soon distracted from his own son by Cleveland, Jr. (Henry), who can drive a ball 300 yards. Cleveland warns him that the boy has a short attention span, but Peter is determined to turn the boy into a pro, and enters him into the golf club's "Man-Boy Golf Tournament," all the while ignoring his own son. Meanwhile, Stewie (MacFarlane) destroys Brian's (MacFarlane) library. Revenge is served cold when Stewie returns from getting his first vaccination, and Brian soon has him convinced that he's been injected with some kind of mind control serum. This episode features the voice talents of Gary Cole and Nicole Sullivan. The cold opening, a cruel parody of Little House on the Prairie, was edited from FOX's original airing of the episode, but was restored in repeats(n)</desc>
