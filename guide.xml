Now, two decades on, he's been sacked from his dead-end job, ditched by his girlfriend and forced to move into his sister's attic. However, he unexpectedly - and unwittingly - gets another bite at stardom while preparing for a one-off gig with his 18-year-old nephew Josh's band.

And when the film clip is posted on the web it goes viral..(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Yours, Mine &amp; Ours</title>
    <desc lang="en">Two big families merge into one super-sized brood in this comedy. Frank Beardsley (Dennis Quaid) is a naval officer who has been raising eight children on his own after the death of his wife, and while he loves his kids, he rules his household with military precision. Frank has been alone just long enough that he decides it's time to start dating again, and he agrees to be set up on a blind date for a social function. To his surprise, his date turns out to be Helen North (Rene Russo), a girl he dated years ago when they were both in high school who, like Frank, lost her spouse not long ago. The old chemistry clicks anew for Helen and Frank, and he asks her to marry him. However, there's just a bit of a problem -- Helen is caring for ten children of her own, six of whom were adopted, and her artistic temperament makes for a very different household than Frank and his kids are used to. Frank and Helen decide to give this grand experiment a try, but the 18 siblings don't get along at all well at first, until they decide to set aside their differences and unite against a common foe -- their folks. Yours, Mine &amp; Ours is a remake of a 1968 comedy of the same name, which starred Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball as the newlywed parents(n)</desc>

From a remote stretch of Argentina's Parana River, a bloody attack on a young swimmer points to something dangerous in the water.

But to convince himself that it is the culprit, Jeremy needs to catch a specimen big enough to inflict the chilling wounds he has heard about(n)</desc>

As he braves killer crocodiles, poisonous fish and deadly tides, will Jeremy be one of the first people ever to catch a Glyphis?(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Jane Austen: Behind Closed Doors</title>
    <desc lang="en">Historian Lucy Worsley embarks on a road trip across England to take in some of the places Jane Austen lived in and visited during her lifetime. She aims to demonstrate how Jane's personal experiences influenced the central themes of home and property in her novels, and makes use of detective-work to recreate some of the most important locations that no longer stand. She begins in Stoneleigh Abbey, Warwickshire, retracing a journey that marked one of the many times the Austens veered wildly between wealth and genteel poverty - mirroring the Dashwoods of Sense and Sensibility. Lucy also travels from Jane's birthplace in Steventon, Hampshire, to her brother's grand estate at Godmersham Park - the inspiration for Darcy's Pemberley in Pride and Prejudice, along with Lyme Regis, Bath and Southampton.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Jo Cox: Death of an MP</title>
    <desc lang="en">On June 16, 2016, Labour MP for Batley and Spen Jo Cox was assaulted and gunned down following a constituency surgery in Batley, West Yorkshire. Her attacker was Thomas Mair, a local man whose personal political views are said to have been antithetical to Cox's, and were thought to have driven him to murder. This documentary makes use of eye-witness testimonies to tell the story of the brutal attack that brought an end to the life of a passionate and ambitious parliamentarian. The film profiles her killer, presenting a portrait of a conflicted, contradictory man who volunteered to help people of all races, but harboured a secret obsession with Nazism and the extreme right-wing.(n)</desc>

Resident artists such as Picasso and Matisse found the sun-drenched landscape ideal for experimenting with their work, and as the region became a creative hub, the likes of novelist Jean Cocteau and ballet impresario Sergei Diaghilev were drawn to the area. This artistic community also liked to party on the Cote d'Azur's beaches - a pastime that proved equally irresistible to the American multimillionaires arriving in the area on board transatlantic liners.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Free to Murder Again. The Texas penal system wakes up from a nightmare in the A&amp;E program American Justice: Free to Murder Again. The subject of the documentary is serial killer Kenneth McDuff, the biggest mistake the parole board ever made. McDuff was first sentenced to death in 1968 for killing three teenagers. Seemingly, his incarceration meant the end of his murder spree. But due to the overcrowding of Texas jails, McDuff was eventually released after serving only 21 years. Soon, the criminal was back on the streets harassing children and adults alike. In 1991, McDuff abducted and killed a young woman only to repeat the pattern two years later with a pregnant mother of two. When he was captured and resentenced to death, his murderous trail was reported to include a handful of others. McDuff's situation alerted the government to the failures of the parole boards. His case eventually resulted in a slew of new prison constructions and tough law reforms(n)</desc>

In helping to give the orphans of war-torn Sudan a better future, the former outlaw begins to find new meaning in his own life as well(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Gore Verbinski and the crew set sail once again for this, the third chapter in the swashbuckling Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is hopelessly trapped in Davy Jones' locker after a harrowing encounter with the dreaded Kracken, and now Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) must align themselves with the nefarious Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) if they hold out any hope of saving their old friend from a fate worse than death. The East India Trading Company and its fearsome leader, Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), have taken control of the ghostly Flying Dutchman and its captain, Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), and now the baleful Admiral Norrington (Jack Davenport) has taken the helm in a relentless bid to destroy every pirate ship in his path and bring the Age of Piracy to a violent close. Meanwhile, Will, Elizabeth, and Captain Barbossa navigate treacherous waters and face bitter betrayal as they set sail to gather the only army that can stand up to Beckett -- The Nine Lords of the Brethren Court. But Captain Jack Sparrow is one of the lords, and as long as he's stuck in Davy Jones' locker, Beckett and his nefarious armada are sure to emerge victorious. There's still hope, however, if the heroic team that includes Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris), Pintel (Lee Arenberg), and Ragetti (Mackenzie Crook) can reach exotic Singapore and convince vulpine pirate Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat) to provide them with charts and a ship. But even the powerful Brethren Court may need a bit of help from volatile sea goddess Calypso in order to weather the coming storm. With the entire future of the pirate way at stake, everyone will be forced to choose sides while drifting precariously to the edge of the earth for one final, spectacular battle(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Jaws 3</title>
    <desc lang="en">An ocean-themed Florida amusement park comes under attack from an angry Great White shark in this third installment of the horror series. The film maintains only a loose relationship to the original Steven Spielberg hit, centering on Mike (Dennis Quaid) and Sean (John Putch), the sons of police chief Martin Brody (originally played by Roy Scheider). Mike works at Sea World, where a baby Great White shark has accidentially been let into the park. Soon, the baby's vicious and extremely powerful mother comes in search of her child. The film focuses most of its attention on the series of tense shark attacks that follow, as tourists run for their lives while the park workers struggle to destroy the sharp-toothed beast. The suspense sequences were made somewhat more memorable during the film's original release with 3-D photography, an attribute lost on video, thereby removing the most distinctive element of an otherwise run-of-the-mill sequel(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Machine Gun Preacher</title>
    <desc lang="en">A former biker and drug dealer single-handedly takes on the nefarious Lord's Resistance Army in a noble bid to save young Sudanese refugees from a life of violence and suffering. Inspired by actual events, Marc Forster's Machine Gun Preacher stars Gerard Butler as Sam Childers, a tough-as-nails biker whose heart shatters upon witnessing the harrowing plight of children in Sudan. Determined that no child shall be enslaved by the brutal Lord's Resistance Army, Childers turns to God for inspiration, and establishes an orphanage for wounded kids and child soldiers. When the Lord's Resistance Army refuses to stand down, Childers organizes a militia to protect the children. In helping to give the orphans of war-torn Sudan a better future, the former outlaw begins to find new meaning in his own life as well(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Bats</title>
    <desc lang="en">Beware of what goes "bump" (and "squeak" and "flap flap flap") in the night. Dr. Sheila Casper (Dina Meyer) is a respected zoologist dispatched by the government to Gallup, TX, a small community suffering from an unusual number of reported bat attacks. Casper finds this news puzzling, since bats are generally placid creatures who avoid contact with humans. The local sheriff, Emmett Kimsey (Lou Diamond Phillips), assures Casper that the reports are on the level and that something needs to be done about swarms of aggressive bats so thick they blot out the moon. Caspar and Kimsey discover that a new breed of genetically altered bats have escaped from a research facility and taken up residence in a cave near Gallup -- but the nocturnal bloodsuckers have no intention of leaving as quickly as they arrived. Bats was written by John Logan, who had two other projects hit the screen within a few months of Bats' release: Oliver Stone's Any Given Sunday and Ridley Scott's Gladiator. The supporting cast includes Leon and Bob Gunton(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Jaws 3</title>
    <desc lang="en">An ocean-themed Florida amusement park comes under attack from an angry Great White shark in this third installment of the horror series. The film maintains only a loose relationship to the original Steven Spielberg hit, centering on Mike (Dennis Quaid) and Sean (John Putch), the sons of police chief Martin Brody (originally played by Roy Scheider). Mike works at Sea World, where a baby Great White shark has accidentially been let into the park. Soon, the baby's vicious and extremely powerful mother comes in search of her child. The film focuses most of its attention on the series of tense shark attacks that follow, as tourists run for their lives while the park workers struggle to destroy the sharp-toothed beast. The suspense sequences were made somewhat more memorable during the film's original release with 3-D photography, an attribute lost on video, thereby removing the most distinctive element of an otherwise run-of-the-mill sequel(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Bart Gets Famous. After sneaking away from a school field trip to a box factory, Bart Simpson (voice of Nancy Cartwright) makes his way to the television studio where his hero, Krusty the Clown (voice of Dan Castellaneta), tapes his show. When Krusty throws a star fit after not being served the Danish he demanded, Bart steals one for him from newsman Kent Brockman (voice of Harry Shearer), and the grateful clown gives Bart a job as his assistant. Bart soon discovers that being Krusty's assistant means doing the errands no one else is willing to do ("Now I need you to go clean out my toilet . . . Eew! I don't know what I was thinking last night!"), but when Sideshow Mel falls ill, Bart is given a small part in a sketch. Bart muffs his entrance, then tries to cover by saying "I didn't do it." The line gets a big laugh, and Krusty brings Bart back again to say the line several more times. Soon Bart is famous as "The I Didn't Do It Boy," but he grows tired of being known only for his catch phrase. He soon discovers, though, that his fans aren't all that interested in watching him expand his repertoire. "Bart Gets Famous" first aired on February 3, 1994(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins usher the nine remaining home-bakers back into the tent for the fourth week of the contest. This time, the competitors must tackle desserts, beginning with a signature challenge in the form of a French classic - creme brulees. With the clock ticking, the contestants must grill their offerings to perfection to avoid serving up an unappetising scrambled egg and custard soup. Next up is the technical challenge, in which Mary Berry asks the group to prepare Spanische Windtorte, an Austrian meringue inspired by the tastes of Spain, Switzerland and France. Finally, the showstopper this week involves baking a three-tiered cheesecake stack, and only the most structurally sound creations will be worthy of securing their maker the title of star baker.(n)</desc>

For the signature bake, they are asked to create a variety of sugar-free cakes, and one competitor decides to take an even healthier step by preparing a cake without any traditional form of flour. Next up, in the technical challenge, Paul Hollywood sets the bakers to work making gluten-free pittas using a particularly sticky dough, and for the showstoppers, they must create dairy-free ice-cream rolls.(n)</desc>

However, this is Baltimore and it is 1962 - and Tracy's both overweight and, worse, has liberal attitudes to race relations, which don't sit comfortably with the segregationist views of the show's producer. But, could Tracy's ambitions for not only appearing on the show, but also racially integrating it, receive a fillip when she meets the son of Motormouth Maybelle, host of the monthly 'Negro Day' edition of the show?(n)</desc>

Set in 2010, the world looks toward the mysterious Tracy Island when mere international security is not enough; the remote South Pacific island not only houses former astronaut and lifelong entrepreneur Jeff Tracy (Bill Paxton) and his five sons, but also serves as headquarters for the top-secret International Rescue organization. The unthinkable happens, however, when an insidious criminal mastermind known only as "The Hood" (Ben Kingsley) manages to get past the island's innumerable security measures and attempts to take over International Rescue. His goal: stealing the organization's five most advanced rescue vehicles, each of which was designed to accomplish a specific task, and using them for his own agenda. With Jeff and his four eldest sons deployed on a mission, there's only one person with any hope of stopping the takeover -- Jeff's youngest son, Alan (Brady Corbet), who vows to save his family and keep the Thunderbirds alive(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">My Big Fat Greek Wedding</title>
    <desc lang="en">One woman's rocky road to the altar gets played for laughs in this comedy, adapted from the one-woman off-Broadway show written by and starring Nia Vardalos. Toula (Vardalos) is a Greek-American woman who is in her early thirties and single, with no immediate prospects of changing that status any time soon. This bothers Toula a bit, but not half as much as it distresses her mother (Lainie Kazan) and father (Michael Constantine), who want to send her to Greece in hopes of finding a husband in the old country. Toula isn't interested in leaving the country to find a man, but since she works in the family business -- a Greek restaurant in Chicago called Dancing Zorba's -- she has to hear about it whether she likes it or not. One day, after seeing a handsome stranger in the restaurant and not having the courage to talk to him, Toula decides she needs a bit of self-improvement. Despite her dad's misgivings, Toula signs up for a night-school class studying computers, trades in her glasses for contact lenses, gets a different job at a travel agency, and spruces herself up with a new look and a new attitude. To her very pleasant surprise, she once again encounters the handsome stranger, who soon asks her out on a date. Schoolteacher Ian Miller (John Corbett) is seemingly perfect -- he's tall, handsome, smart, good-natured, and soon in love with Toula -- except for two little things: he's not Greek, and he's a vegetarian, both of which horrify Toula's family. When Ian pops the question (and Toula says yes), the bride-to-be has to negotiate a reasonably peaceful meeting between Ian's upper-class parents and her own working-class extended family. There's also the matter of the wedding, which Toula's mother is planning around the notion that quantity IS quality. My Big Fat Greek Wedding also features Ian Gomez (Vardalos' real-life husband), Louis Mandylor, Andrea Martin, and Joey Fatone (from the pop group *NSYNC). Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson helped produce the film through the auspices of their production company, Playtone(n)</desc>

However, the couple was from Caroline County, Virginia, and had to travel elsewhere so they could be wed -- Richard was white, Mildred was of mixed African-American and Native-American ancestry, and under Virginia's Racial Integrity Act, they could not be legally married in that state, one of sixteen that had anti-miscegenation statutes on the books. A sheriff in Caroline County chose to make an example of the Lovings and arrested them for their "crime" of being married. Richard and Mildred were found guilty and received a suspended sentence of one year in prison; they moved to Washington D.C. and raised three children, but would occasionally sneak back to Virginia for family gatherings. In 1963, with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union, the Lovings filed a suit demanding their case be set aside on the grounds that the Racial Integrity Act was unconstitutional; the suit eventually reached the United States Supreme Court, and became one of the defining legal battles of the Civil Rights movement. Filmmaker Nancy Buirski tells the story of the Lovings' battle for the right to marry, as well as profiling the couple behind the headlines, in the documentary The Loving Story. Including home movies of the Loving family and interviews with their friends and relatives, The Loving Story was an official selection at the 2011 Tribeca Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Slumdog Millionaire</title>
    <desc lang="en">Accused of cheating and desperate to prove his innocence, an eighteen-year-old orphan from the slums of Mumbai reflects back on his tumultuous life while competing to win 20 million rupees on India's Who Wants to Be a Millionaire in Danny Boyle's inspirational drama. Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) may not have a penny to his name, but that could all change in a matter of hours. He's one question away from taking the top prize on India's most popular television game show, but as with everything else in Jamal's life, it isn't going to be easy. Arrested by police under suspicion of cheating, Jamal is interrogated by the authorities. The police simply can't believe that a common "slumdog" could possibly possess the knowledge to get this far in the game, and in order to convince them of how he gained such knowledge, Jamal begins reflecting back on his childhood. As young boys, Jamal and his older brother, Salim, lived in squalor, and lost their mother in a mob attack on Muslims. Subsequently forced to rely on their own wits to survive, the desperate siblings fell back on petty crime, eventually befriending adorable yet feisty young Latika as they sought out food and shelter on the unforgiving streets of Mumbai. Though life on the streets was never easy, Jamal's experiences ultimately instilled in him the knowledge he needed to answer the tough questions posed to him on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. And though Jamal makes a convincing case for himself, one question still remains: why would a young man with no apparent desire for wealth or fame be so determined to win big on a national game show? Of course, it won't be long until everyone finds out the answer to this burning question, because as Jamal sits down to find out whether he will be rich beyond his wildest dreams, 60 million viewers remain transfixed to their televisions eager to see if he'll correctly answer the final question(n)</desc>

Scotty buys an antique desk and -- hidden in a secret compartment -- he finds a letter from a woman named Elizabeth Whitcomb (Jennifer Jason Leigh), who lived during the 19th century. Fascinated by the letter, Scotty writes her a reply, using antique writing materials, and is shocked when he receives a reply -- somehow he's been able to communicate with her through time, and they begin a correspondence that spans a century and a half. It turns out that Elizabeth is also pledged to marry, but she does not love her fiancée, and a romance begins to blossom through the mail and across time. The Love Letter was produced for the television anthology series The Hallmark Hall of Fame(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">"In space, no one can hear you scream." A close encounter of the third kind becomes a Jaws-style nightmare when an alien invades a spacecraft in Ridley Scott's sci-fi horror classic. On the way home from a mission for the Company, the Nostromo's crew is woken up from hibernation by the ship's Mother computer to answer a distress signal from a nearby planet. Capt. Dallas's (Tom Skerritt) rescue team discovers a bizarre pod field, but things get even stranger when a face-hugging creature bursts out of a pod and attaches itself to Kane (John Hurt). Over the objections of Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), science officer Ash (Ian Holm) lets Kane back on the ship. The acid-blooded incubus detaches itself from an apparently recovered Kane, but an alien erupts from Kane's stomach and escapes. The alien starts stalking the humans, pitting Dallas and his crew (and cat) against a malevolent killing machine that also has a protector in the nefarious Company(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Alien</title>
    <desc lang="en">"In space, no one can hear you scream." A close encounter of the third kind becomes a Jaws-style nightmare when an alien invades a spacecraft in Ridley Scott's sci-fi horror classic. On the way home from a mission for the Company, the Nostromo's crew is woken up from hibernation by the ship's Mother computer to answer a distress signal from a nearby planet. Capt. Dallas's (Tom Skerritt) rescue team discovers a bizarre pod field, but things get even stranger when a face-hugging creature bursts out of a pod and attaches itself to Kane (John Hurt). Over the objections of Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), science officer Ash (Ian Holm) lets Kane back on the ship. The acid-blooded incubus detaches itself from an apparently recovered Kane, but an alien erupts from Kane's stomach and escapes. The alien starts stalking the humans, pitting Dallas and his crew (and cat) against a malevolent killing machine that also has a protector in the nefarious Company(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Alien Resurrection</title>
    <desc lang="en">The fourth film in the Alien series, directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Delicatessen, The City of Lost Children) at a cost of 70 million dollars, takes place aboard an immense ship, the Auriga, where General Perez (Dan Hedaya) heads a staff of seven science officers and 42 enlisted, all employed by United Systems Military (replacing the Company of the earlier films). The time is 200 years after the events of Alien 3. The ship in question now carries the body of Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), which has been cloned from preserved blood samples - and now contains the fetus of an alien embryo - leading to a very grotesque and nauseous surgical operation near the outset of the film, wherein the scientific team removes the baby Alien Queen from Ripley's chest. Since the Ripley clone has alien DNA mixed into her genetic structure, she is not totally human and eventually feels a certain maternal draw to the aliens. Moreover, an alien queen has incorporated part of Ripley's reproductive system and can now produce grotesque, skeletal alien spawns. Later, a commercial freighter, the Betty, arrives with a crew of mercenaries -- Elgyn (Michael Wincott), pilot Hillard (Kim Flowers), paralyzed mechanic Vriess (Dominique Pinon), space jock Johner (Ron Perlman), and junior mechanic Annalee Call (Winona Ryder). Problems begin when the mercenaries take over the Auriga, and aliens escape to massacre humans. As the aliens attack, Ripley and the mercenaries try to reach the Betty in order to escape. Cinematography by Darius Khondji features the same ENR process he used on Seven, adding silver to the printing process to heighten contrasts, making the dark colors richer. An electric-blue tint was employed during the underwater firefight between the mercenaries and the aliens. For the more physical aspects of her role, Ryder got in shape with six hours of daily workouts. Although all previous films in the series were shot at London's Pinewood Studios, filming of Alien Resurrection took place West Los Angeles soundstages with special effects in California and Paris(n)</desc>

Eventually the family earn a spot of money by taking in a dramatist as their lodger, prompting Micawber to tell his house guest all about his early life - leading to a series of flashbacks that reveal how and why he came to be in such a woeful position.

    <sub-title lang="en">Cleopatra's Lost Tomb.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">An insight into the pioneering work of criminal lawyer-turned-archaeologist Dr Kathleen Martinez, who has made it her life's mission to locate the final resting place of Cleopatra, Egypt's last queen. Despite centuries of searching, very little evidence of the location of Cleopatra's tomb has ever been uncovered, but Kathleen's radical new theory on the queen's identity has led her to search where no-one else dared. Her hunch stunned the archaeological establishment as she uncovered a hidden network of tunnels and a vast city of the dead, as well as a 35-metre deep underground hole that bears all the hallmarks of a burial shaft.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Wild Hunger</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Wild Hunger. In the third episode of the Animal Underworld series, Henry Rollins examines the roles that animals play as food, medicine, and drugs around the world. What makes some animals acceptable for consumption in some cultures but sacred or a beloved pet in another? In North Carolina, he tags along with people who make meals by salvaging road kill. In India, he meets men from the Irula tribe who hunt and milk snakes for venom that will be sold to produce antivenin. In Vietnam, he searches for a cure for his ailments by strolling through colorful and diverse markets where Traditional Chinese Medicine products (rare and endangered) abound. He then visits a sanctuary where young bears are recovering from the cruel practice of harvesting bile from their gallbladders. Afterwards he gains access to an operating bear bile farm and is disturbed by what he sees. He sets out to uncover some of the most extreme cases of animal consumption . . . and, more importantly, why these seemingly taboo subcultures ingest and inject what they do(n)</desc>

In this episode, Henry Rollins investigates the animal connection to the supernatural. His journey into the animal underworld of worship takes him from a farm full of animals awaiting ritual Santeria sacrifice to the Sonoran Desertwhere he will witness others taking a spiritual journey by smoking the venom of a sacred toad. It's a world where animals are the key to help humans tap into the divine, and the primal is surprisingly close to home. So join us as we head straight into the heart of the Animal Underworld(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">(2004) Paul Haggis won two Oscars for his major feature debut as director and co-writer. Set in Los Angeles over two days, it is a picaresque, episodic film with a cast of disparate characters whose lives coincide for one reason or another, from racist cop John Ryan (Matt Dillon) who pulls over black TV director Cameron Thayer (Terrence Howard) and his wife Christine (Thandie Newton), to the simple hassles that Iranian Farad (Shaun Toub) encounters. Haggis shows a city where racism and its manifestations are easily encountered but where those at both the giving and receiving end are not simple ciphers but complex human beings whose intolerance is caused by both personal problems and issues within society at large.

    <desc lang="en">(2004) Paul Haggis won two Oscars for his major feature debut as director and co-writer. Set in Los Angeles over two days, it is a picaresque, episodic film with a cast of disparate characters whose lives coincide for one reason or another, from racist cop John Ryan (Matt Dillon) who pulls over black TV director Cameron Thayer (Terrence Howard) and his wife Christine (Thandie Newton), to the simple hassles that Iranian Farad (Shaun Toub) encounters. Haggis shows a city where racism and its manifestations are easily encountered but where those at both the giving and receiving end are not simple ciphers but complex human beings whose intolerance is caused by both personal problems and issues within society at large.

Haggis shows a city where racism and its manifestations are easily encountered but where those at both the giving and receiving end are not simple ciphers but complex human beings whose intolerance is caused by both personal problems and issues within society at large.

    <title lang="en">It Runs in the Family</title>
    <desc lang="en">A family takes on the difficult task of learning how to get along with one another in this emotional comedy drama. Alex Gromberg (Michael Douglas) is a middle-aged man who feels caught in the middle of his familial obligations as he muddles he way through a midlife crisis. While a successful businessman, Alex sometimes still feels as if he's under the shadow of his father, Mitchell Gromberg (Kirk Douglas), a successful attorney whose skills in the courtroom outstripped his gifts as a parent. Elderly Mitchell has recently survived a stroke, and Alex and Mitchell want to mend their relationship while there's still time, but making it so proves difficult, even with Alex getting advice from his wife, psychologist Rebecca (Bernadette Peters), and Mitchell being prodded by his long-suffering wife, Evelyn (Diana Douglas). Alex is also trying to reach out to his two sons, who are as different as night and day; college student Asher (Cameron Douglas) is an aspiring club DJ who seems to be styling himself to bear no resemblance to his father, while 11-year-old Eli (Rory Culkin) is an overly serious lad who is having trouble navigating the first steps of adolescence. It Runs in the Family marked the first time Kirk Douglas acted in a film with his son Michael Douglas; adding to the family atmosphere was Michael's son Cameron Douglas, working with his family for the first time, and Diana Douglas, Kirk's former wife and Michael's mother(n)</desc>

Not used to balancing his new life with his old, Todd mistakenly invites family and friends from his old neighborhood to his multi-million-dollar house for a cookout on the same day of an important endorsement interview. Though his extravagant family cookouts were welcome at his old digs, Todd's stuffy new neighbors -- particularly the conservative Republican Judge Halsted Crowley (Danny Glover) -- are less than thrilled with the arrival of Todd's massive family. Complicating the situation further is the eccentric neighborhood security guard (Queen Latifah), who takes on the heady assignment of ensuring that none of the private community's rules are broken, as well as two thugs who, determined to get an autographed pair of sneakers, hold up the cookout at gunpoint.

    <desc lang="en">Antibodies director Christian Alvart takes suspense into space with this tale of two astronauts who realize that they aren't alone as they drift into the darkest corners of our galaxy. Awakening in their hyper-sleep chamber with no memory of who they are or what their mission is, disoriented astronauts Lt. Payton (Dennis Quaid) and Corporal Bower (Ben Foster) gradually surmise that they are the only ones aboard the darkened spacecraft. But how did they get here, and what are those strange sounds coming from the other side of the ship? The only way out of their hyper-sleep chamber is a cramped air shaft, and the only one small enough to climb through it is Corporal Bower. As he shimmies inside to investigate, Lt. Payton mans the radio transmitter. But the deeper Corporal Bower ventures into the ship, the more apparent it becomes that something horrible has happened. There were 60,000 passengers onboard when the astronauts went to sleep, and now there's not a soul in sight. Before long, the two weakened and weary space travelers are fighting for their lives against a force neither can comprehend. Could it be that the survival of the entire human race rests in the hands of these two astronauts stuck on a lonely ship in deep space?(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Pandorum</title>
    <desc lang="en">Antibodies director Christian Alvart takes suspense into space with this tale of two astronauts who realize that they aren't alone as they drift into the darkest corners of our galaxy. Awakening in their hyper-sleep chamber with no memory of who they are or what their mission is, disoriented astronauts Lt. Payton (Dennis Quaid) and Corporal Bower (Ben Foster) gradually surmise that they are the only ones aboard the darkened spacecraft. But how did they get here, and what are those strange sounds coming from the other side of the ship? The only way out of their hyper-sleep chamber is a cramped air shaft, and the only one small enough to climb through it is Corporal Bower. As he shimmies inside to investigate, Lt. Payton mans the radio transmitter. But the deeper Corporal Bower ventures into the ship, the more apparent it becomes that something horrible has happened. There were 60,000 passengers onboard when the astronauts went to sleep, and now there's not a soul in sight. Before long, the two weakened and weary space travelers are fighting for their lives against a force neither can comprehend. Could it be that the survival of the entire human race rests in the hands of these two astronauts stuck on a lonely ship in deep space?(n)</desc>

Xavier (Romain Duris) is a French economics student who is nearing the completion of his degree and is looking for work. Xavier's father arranges for him to meet a ranking member of the Ministry of Finance, who makes him an offer -- he can give him a good job, but only under the condition that he learn to speak Spanish. Determined not to pass up the opportunity, Xavier enrolls in a language program in Barcelona, despite the misgivings of his girlfriend, Martine (Audrey Tautou). Upon his arrival, Xavier moves into a large house shared by a large group of students from all over Europe. Xavier finds that his ideas and attitudes are challenged in a positive way by the diverse personalities of his housemates, and that his loyalty to Martine is tested by his attraction to Anne-Sophie (Judith Godrèche), a sweet but lonesome woman from France who has been away from her husband for too long. After a visit, most of Xavier's roommates decide they don't much care for Martine and Xavier gets advice on seducing Anne-Sophie from an unexpected source -- Isabelle (Cécile de France), a footloose lesbian living in the house. L'Auberge Espagnole received its world premier at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival, and went on to earn prizes at the 2002 Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, the 2003 Lumière Awards, and the 2003 César Awards(n)</desc>

Joe Kingman (Johnson) was a star quarterback destined for greatness; not only is the Boston-based team he plays for well on their way to the championships, but he's got all the money and fame that a man could want out of life. A perpetual bachelor whose one brief marriage ended many moons ago, Kingman is stunned to learn that a long-forgotten youthful fling had more permanent consequences than he ever anticipated. Now, just as his career is set to blow up bigger than ever, this perpetual bachelor learns that he has a seven-year-old daughter named Peyton (Madison Pettis). So how does a lifelong jock who's used to partying all night and dropping 20-yard bombs all day adjust to a life of ballet classes, Barbie dolls, and afternoon play dates? Whatever road he chooses to take, it certainly won't be easy, especially since his ruthless, goal-oriented agent, Stella (Kyra Sedgwick), would rather see her client scoring touchdowns than cementing familial bonds(n)</desc>

So successful is Kelly's video effort that a major network (no, not Fox) evinces interest in picking up the show for the Big Time. Katey Sagal (Peggy) does not appear in this episode, nor does Amanda Bearse (who served as director)show up in her familiar "Marcy D'Arcy" character--though Bearse can be fleetingly seen in the Access show "Short Haired Women in Banking."
