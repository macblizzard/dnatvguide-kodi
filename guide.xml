    <desc lang="en">Nicky has studied the science of human nature his whole life, and understands precisely how to earn anyone's trust, or fool them into never noticing he's stealing their watch, or wallet, or anything they might have that Nicky can sell. In the movie's opening sequence, he's eating at a New York restaurant when the gorgeous Jess approaches his table and asks him to pretend to be her boyfriend so that she can avoid a particularly determined guy at the bar who won't stop hitting on her. The two of them hit it off, but he quickly figures out that she's running a scam on him and soon turns the tables on her and her partner. Undaunted, Jess begs Nicky to teach her what he knows about the criminal life, and he brings her in on a plan to steal from as many people as possible during Super Bowl week in New Orleans. She turns out to be a natural, and quickly learns the ropes of this unscrupulous world. Nicky and Jess seem to be falling for each other, but Nicky's actions at the end of their New Orleans trip force Jess to reassess their relationship. Three years later, Nicky enters into a deal with Garriga (Rodrigo Santoro), a wealthy playboy who has a software program that will help his Formula 1 team triumph. Nicky agrees to help Garriga sell a fake version of the program to his competitors, but as the plan goes into motion he discovers Jess and Garriga are a couple. As old feelings complicate the new arrangement, Nicky must also contend with the no-nonsense Owens (Gerald McRaney), Garriga's head-of-security who openly distrusts Nicky(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This drama about affluent Los Angeles teens is taken from the novel by Bret Easton Ellis. Clay (Andrew McCarthy) is a college freshman who returns home during Christmas break.

While Clay tries to rekindle a thing with Blair, Julian becomes addicted to cocaine and starts freebasing. Julian's friends try halfheartedly to intervene, with no success. Soon he is so far in debt to drug dealer Rip (James Spader) that Julian becomes a male prostitute, whoring for enough money for his next fix.

    <desc lang="en">Otherworldly villains are on the loose again, and it's up to Earth's interstellar police force to bring them to justice in this sequel to the sci-fi comedy blockbuster Men in Black. Agent Jay (Will Smith) has become a high-ranking member of the Men in Black, the secret government task force designed to deal with unruly visitors from other worlds, while his former cohort, Agent Kay (Tommy Lee Jones), had his memory wiped clean and now lives a simple but contented life as a mailman. However, an especially nasty alien threat has reared its not-so-ugly head; Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle) is a shape-shifting Kylothian alien who is in pursuit of another escaped visitor who holds the key to powers that would allow her to destroy the world. Making Serleena all the more dangerous is the fact she's taken on the appearance of a lingerie model, making her irresistible to most men. When the rampaging Serleena takes control of the MIB offices, Jay is forced to turn to the only man who can help him save the world -- the former Agent Kay. After restoring Kay's memory, the two remaining Men in Black set out to conquer Serleena with a motley band of friendly aliens, including a handful of worm creatures and a talking dog named Frank (voice of Tim Blaney). Jay, meanwhile, has his head turned by Laura (Rosario Dawson), an attractive waitress who was an unwitting witness to an alien attack. Men in Black 2 also features Rip Torn, Tony Shalhoub, David Cross, Patrick Warburton, and Johnny Knoxville(n)</desc>

If only he were to find a pretty girl who was willing to teach him the ropes around his new high school, Joey could finally stop fretting about fitting in. Perhaps Mary (Selena Gomez) is just such a girl, though this Cinderella is more likely to waltz in a new pair of dancing shoes than a pair of glass slipper(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Jumanji</title>
    <desc lang="en">Computer-generated action comes fast and furious in this special-effects driven fantasy adventure. The adventure begins in 1969 when little Alan Parish, lonely, picked on, and largely ignored by his wealthy father, a shoe manufacturer in a picturesque New England town, explores a construction site and unearths a mysterious, ornate box with the name Jumanji upon it. He takes it home to his big empty mansion and sees that it is some sort of game. His father returns home and informs the poor boy, who had been beaten up earlier in the day, that he has been enrolled in a prestigious boarding school. A fight ensues just before his parents go out for the evening. Alone and frustrated, Alan and his friend Sarah, open the box and begin playing the strange game. As soon as they choose their pieces and set them upon the board, the pieces become stuck. Sarah rolls the dice and her piece moves by itself. As it moves the great crystal in the center of the game board begins to swirl and a cryptic message appears. Suddenly the room is filled with giant African bats. Alan rolls next and finds himself encircled in a swirling vortex of smoke and he is then literally sucked into the game. Nothing the terrified Sarah does can get him back, so she flees. Over twenty years pass and a young woman and two children, her orphaned niece and nephew, are seen moving into the now-ramshackle Parrish manse. There the children hear a great drumming sound in the attic. Curious, they creep in and find Jumanji. They begin to play the game and suddenly find themselves beset by deadly blood-sucking mosquitoes, maliciously mischievous monkeys, man-eating plants, and a lion. Then long-lost, but now full-grown, Alan suddenly appears pursued by an ruthless 18th-century hunter. Banished by the game to live alone in the jungle all these years, Alan has become a crazed wild man. It is he who explains the sinister game that must be completed for the horror to end. After recruiting a reluctant and frightened grown-up Sarah, the hapless players unleash upon themselves and their town, untold horrors, including a stampeding heard of African animals, crocodiles, and a flood(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Mummy Returns</title>
    <desc lang="en">This big-budget sequel from writer/director Stephen Sommers navigates much of the same cliffhanger territory as George Lucas and Steven Spielberg's Indiana Jones franchise. It is 1933, eight years after the events of The Mummy (1999). Legionnaire Rick O'Connell Brendan Fraser has married his Egyptologist girlfriend Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) and the couple has settled in London, where they're raising their young son Alex (Freddie Boath). The family's domestic tranquility is shattered when the 3,000-year-old mummified corpse of Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), which has been shipped to the British Museum, is resurrected once again to resume his evil quest for immortality. In the meantime, another ancient threat emerges in the form of the Scorpion King (professional wrestler Dwayne Johnson, aka. the Rock), a mighty warrior frozen in time with his supernatural army. In order to save his family, Rick is forced to seek a mythical pyramid of gold, facing marauding bands of pygmy skeletons, among other hazards. The Mummy Returns co-stars John Hannah, Oded Fehr, and Patricia Velasquez(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Hull FC v Warrington Wolves (Kick-off 3.00pm). Mark Chapman introduces coverage of the showpiece occasion at Wembley Stadium, as the successors to Leeds Rhinos are decided. The Rhinos hammered Hull Kingston Rovers 50-0 in the final last season, but this clash is likely to be much closer, with both sides having been among the Super League leaders for much of the campaign. Both have a realistic chance of securing a league and cup double this year, and the Airlie Birds have the psychological advantage of having beaten the Wolves in both meetings this term. With commentary by Dave Woods and analysis by Brian Noble, Jamie Peacock and Jon Wilkin.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Good Terrorist</title>
    <desc lang="en">Documentary revisiting the controversial crusade of John Harris, the anti-apartheid campaigner whose exemplary reputation in pursuit of equality in South Africa was ruined when, in 1964, he placed a bomb in a Johannesburg station. His actions resulted in the death of a 77-year-old woman, and the severe burning of her young granddaughter. While Harris' actions up to this point had included helping to ensure South Africa would be barred from the Olympics, the 1964 bombing horrified the country. Harris was hanged eight months later, becoming the only white political prisoner to be executed in four decades of apartheid. More than 50 years later, this film makes use of Harris's own home videos to tell his story, from the perspective of those who knew him, and documents a momentous encounter in the UK between Harris's son and the now grown youngster who was maimed by his bomb.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Nightmare Neighbour Next Door</title>
    <desc lang="en">The documentary focuses on two residential disputes that escalated from complaints about noise-making to far more serious quarrels. Warren and Sharee detail how their peaceful lives in a quiet Birmingham suburb were ruined when new neighbour Harry moved in. Harry complained of noise the pair knew wasn't coming from their household, an accusation he would level more than once, and with increasing intensity. Finally, when the hostile Harry pulled out a gun and threatened the couple over their garden fence, they were forced to sell up and move out. However, even after relocating, it seemed their nightmare was not over. Also featured is the story of Jill, who was just a teenager when Barry, who lived with his parents next-door, became fixated on her family making a racket. Brushing off the grievance, Jill and her relatives tried to get on with their lives, but one autumn day the feud took a tragic, life-changing turn.(n)</desc>

Among the stories highlighted are that of former paratrooper Rod who was attacked outside his own home by a knife-wielding neighbour, and 71-year-old Michael, a Suffolk villager whose fellow residents claim he has systematically harrassed them, culminating in an assault in which he punched one of his neighbours repeatedly - an incident that was caught on camera.

Russ's girlfriend Crystal (Lisa Kudrow) appears on the State Lottery's weekly televised drawing, pulling the numbered balls out of the rotating bin. With the help of a few of his less scrupulous friends - among them sleazy strip joint proprietor Gig (Tim Roth), small time hood Dale The Thug (Michael Rappaport), and Crystal's sleazy cousin Walter (Michael Moore) - Russ figures out a way to rig the drawing and have Crystal pull numbers that they happen to own. However, Russ discovers that making the scheme work and keeping everyone quiet about it is more trouble than it's worth. The supporting cast includes Chris Kattan, Ed O'Neill, and Bill Pullman; Nora Ephron, who previously worked with Travolta on the comedy hit Michael, directed(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Jeremy Clarkson and James May take a look at increasingly popular tall hatchbacks known as crossovers. Having concluded their primary appeal is to caravanners, the duo spend a couple of days in models by Mazda and Volkswagen and try to get a feel for what life is like for the people they believe would buy one. Meanwhile, Richard Hammond drives a pair of exciting Lamborghinis in Italy - the ferocious Aventador Roadster and the limited-edition Sesto Elemento, which carries an eye-watering price tag of around £2million. Two cars are also put through their paces on the test track, with James in a modern re-creation of the classic Porsche 911 and Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler in the rather less exotic Reasonably Priced Car.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Jeremy Clarkson and James May take a look at increasingly popular tall hatchbacks known as crossovers. Having concluded their primary appeal is to caravanners, the duo spend a couple of days in models by Mazda and Volkswagen and try to get a feel for what life is like for the people they believe would buy one. Meanwhile, Richard Hammond drives a pair of exciting Lamborghinis in Italy - the ferocious Aventador Roadster and the limited-edition Sesto Elemento, which carries an eye-watering price tag of around £2million. Two cars are also put through their paces on the test track, with James in a modern re-creation of the classic Porsche 911 and Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler in the rather less exotic Reasonably Priced Car.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In 1998, cinema-goers flocked to see Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, which featured arguably the most realistic and harrowing depiction of the D-Day landings ever captured on celluloid - then went on to tell the tale of a small unit on a mission to rescue a single American soldier whose brothers had all been killed in action. This documentary explores the historical accuracy of the opening battle scene, talking to one of the first men to make it to Omaha Beach on D-Day and testing the science behind some of the bullet and mortar shots. It also reveals the background to the US military's 1944 sole survivor policy, which inspired the movie.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Life Stream.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Cillian Murphy narrates a documentary examining the lives of animals and people pitting themselves against the world's wildest ocean, unveiling the natural forces that underpin life in the Atlantic, from the world's most powerful currents, ferocious hurricanes and huge chains of undersea volcanoes. The first episode looks at the influence of the Gulf Stream, with whales, giant turtles and jellyfish riding the huge current that becomes a migration super-highway and helps warm northern Europe, while fishermen battle for survival in mountainous seas as they try to exploit its natural fertility.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Documentary examining the animals pitting themselves against the world's wildest ocean, unveiling the natural forces that underpin life in the Atlantic. In the vast South Atlantic, huge pods of dolphins, massive penguin colonies and the largest gathering of marine mammals on Earth pack chains of extraordinary islands, created by powerful volcanic forces far below them. Meanwhile, the nutrient-rich upwellings create profusions of life in some areas, and the abyssal depths host a world of bizarre creatures in others.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">State and Main</title>
    <desc lang="en">Echoing the themes of Living in Oblivion and Irma Vep, David Mamet's seventh feature centers on the havoc wrought on the inhabitants of a small town by a troubled film production. After its leading man's propensity for teenage girls gets them banished from their New Hampshire location, a film crew relocates to the small town of Waterford, VT, to finish shooting "The Old Mill." As its title suggests, the film depends on the presence of a genuine mill, something the town is reported to possess. Unfortunately, with only days before principal photography begins, it becomes apparent that the mill in fact burned down decades ago. Unfazed, the film's director, Walt Price (William H. Macy), places his faith in the ability of first-time screenwriter Joseph Turner White (Philip Seymour Hoffman) to alter the script; what he doesn't count on is White's apparently bottomless reserve of angst-fueled writer's block. The film's leading lady (Sarah Jessica Parker) refuses to do her contracted nude scene unless she's give an ungodly sum of cash, while a foreign cinematographer offends the locals by messing with an historic firehouse, and the leading man, Bob Barrenger (Alec Baldwin), dallies with Carla (Julia Stiles), a crafty local teen. Everything comes to a head after Barrenger and Carla are injured in a car accident, which leads White to another emotional quandary and into the arms of Ann Black (Rebecca Pidgeon)(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Kissing Jessica Stein</title>
    <desc lang="en">A woman searching for the perfect man instead discovers the perfect woman in this romantic comedy. Jessica Stein (Jennifer Westfeldt) is a woman with a solid career as a copy editor, but her love life isn't much to write home about; she's been through a long series of disastrous first dates that refuse to evolve into second dates, and the well-intended advice of her best friend Joan (Jackie Hoffman) and former boyfriend Josh (Scott Cohen) isn't helping a bit. One day, Jessica is scanning personal ads in the newspaper with her friends, and she sees one with a quote from her favorite poet. Jessica reads on to discover that she has a lot in common with the person who placed the ad -- too much so, since it turns out the notice is from a woman, Helen Cooper (Heather Juergensen), who manages an art gallery. Jessica figures it would at least be nice to hang out with someone who shares her interests, and she gives Helen a call. Jessica and Helen quickly strike up a close friendship that evolves into something more intimate, though neither of them has ever been involved with another woman ... and Helen is a bit more avid about her new romantic horizons than Jessica. As their relationship progresses, Jessica finds herself struggling with her feelings about her new sexual outlook, and she isn't sure how to break the news about her relationship to her mother (Tovah Feldshuh) as she tries to decide if she should bring Helen along to her brother's wedding. Kissing Jessica Stein was based on the off-Broadway play +Lipschtick, which was written by Jennifer Westfeldt and Heather Juergensen, who starred in the original stage production as well as this film adaptation; the film won both the Critics' Special Jury Award and the Audience Award at the 2001 Los Angeles Film Festival(n)</desc>

It's the late 19th century and a secret organisation within the Vatican is determinedly pursuing its ages-old mission to ensure the extinction of all supernatural beings that threaten mankind. Their star creature-killer is Gabriel Van Helsing, who starts the movie in Paris, where he's on the trail of a rampaging Mr Hyde. Van Helsing is then dispatched to Transylvania, where his assignment is to assist Princess Anna Valerious in her long-standing quest to defeat Count Dracula. Van Helsing is abetted by the ingenious but timid and risk-averse Carl, who churns out a stream of gadgets and weapons (much in the manner of James Bond's inventor Q) for our warrior hero. But the undead nobleman awaits them, and he has forged an unlikely but deadly alliance with other supernaturals... It's not the most intellectually challenging of films, but it's certainly a thrilling horror-tinged fairground ride(n)</desc>

The only hotelier in Las Vegas who can claim that each and every one of his establishments has earned the Royal Review Board's Five Diamond Award, Willy Bank (Pacino) has made more than his share of enemies during his impressive ascent. While most of Bank's adversaries amount to little more than the occasional nuisance, however, this powerful player is about to find out that picking your enemies in Las Vegas can be a true gamble. In betraying Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould), Bank has finally crossed the one man who could bring his entire empire crumbling to the ground -- Danny Ocean (Clooney). Now Reuben is in critical condition, and Ocean is determined to strike back at the man who nearly murdered his mentor. Bank may have taken down one of the original Ocean's Eleven, but his efforts only managed to unite the remaining ten closer than ever before. As the opening of Bank's newest casino draws near, Danny and the crew set into motion a bold plan to humiliate the cocksure casino owner and forever tarnish his spotless reputation. It won't be easy, but if Ocean and his team can get their elaborate plan together in time for the opening of The Bank, they just might be able to deliver some serious Las Vegas justice(n)</desc>

When the Chinese Ambassador to the US is shot while divulging the whereabouts of a major Triad leader, the American authorities once again send Chief Inspector Lee and Detective James Carter into the fray. Lee quickly corners the would-be assassin, Kenji, but Lee's shock at coming face-to-face with an old friend gives the baddie just enough time to escape. Kenji's trail leads the mismatched cops to Paris, where car chases and a sequence among the under-dressed dancers of the Folies Bergère await them, plus rather a lot of dodgy French stereotypes and a finale atop the Eiffel Tower. Also starring Youki Kudoh and Noémie Lenoir, together with, in unlikely cameos, Max von Sydow and Roman Polanski(n)</desc>

Since the moment she first learned to swim at the age of three, Ellie has been inspired by the prospect of one day taking to the water alongside these ocean-bound mammals. However, an intense fear of open water means she has never dived in the ocean. Now, she sets out on a journey to conquer her phobias, one that takes her from Cardigan Bay in Wales to southern Mozambique, and the coastal waters of Ponta do Ouro. Along the way, she offers swimming lessons to young orphans, meets champion free-diver Hanli Prinsloo, and has an unexpected encounter with migrating humpback whales.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Up until the 1950s, food was a relatively simple matter, with narrow choice and a constant battle to keep food fresh. Fast forward to the present day and mass production, intensive farming, refrigeration, freezing and food technology have provided more choice and lower prices. However, a sizeable proportion of food is now processed to maintain freshness, leading presenter Philip Boucher-Hayes to ask if people really know what they are eating. In the first edition, the presenter examines how the Irish consumer has changed over the years, and is joined by chef Hilary O'Hagan to look at processed meat products and the Paleo diet.(n)</desc>

It turns out they're not bad dancers but they need to inject some energy into their performance. Can they let their personalities shine through or will Ashley have to issue a ticket for crimes against streetdancing?.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Honduras.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Ross Kemp visits the Central American republic of Honduras, where he makes his way to the city of San Pedro Sula. With a rate of 169 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants last year - an average of more than three people each day - Sula has the dubious distinction of being the most dangerous city on the planet outside of a war zone. Ross discovers how armed drug gangs have taken over many parts of the country, forcing thousands to flee north on a freight train that transports migrants through Guatemala and across Mexico into the United States. But it's an arduous journey and not for the faint-hearted. Even if passengers avoid falling off the roof of the train to their deaths, they face being robbed by bandits, raped, murdered or kidnapped and sold into slavery.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Casino Royale</title>
    <desc lang="en">Actor Daniel Craig assumes the role formerly occupied by such screen greats as Sean Connery, Roger Moore, and Timothy Dalton to set out on the character's very first 007 mission. James Bond has earned his "00" status by masterfully executing a pair of death-defying professional assassinations. Now assigned the task of traveling to Madagascar to spy on notorious terrorist Mollaka (Sebastien Foucan) for his maiden voyage as a 007 agent, Bond boldly goes against MI6 policy to launch an independent investigation that finds him traversing the Bahamas in search of Mollaka's notoriously elusive terror cell. Subsequently led into the company of the mysterious Dimitrios (Simon Abkarian) and his exotic girlfriend, Solange (Caterina Murino), Bond soon realizes that he is closer than ever to locating well-guarded terrorist financier Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), the man who has personally bankrolled some of the most prevalent terrorist organizations on the planet. When Bond learns that Le Chiffre is planning to partake in an upcoming high-stakes poker game to be played at Montenegro's Le Casino Royale and use the winnings to establish his financial grip on the globe, M (Judi Dench) assigns beguiling agent Vesper (Eva Green) the task of watching over the fledgling agent as he plays against Le Chiffre in a covert attempt to destroy the nefarious gambler's well-established monetary stronghold in the underworld once and for all. Bond will need more than his legendary gambling skills in order to win this dangerous game, though, and after allying himself with local MI6 field agent Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini) and CIA operative Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright), the endlessly suave super-spy puts on his poker face for a high-stakes game of cards in which the stakes are not measured in dollars, but human lives(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Casino Royale</title>
    <desc lang="en">Actor Daniel Craig assumes the role formerly occupied by such screen greats as Sean Connery, Roger Moore, and Timothy Dalton to set out on the character's very first 007 mission. James Bond has earned his "00" status by masterfully executing a pair of death-defying professional assassinations. Now assigned the task of traveling to Madagascar to spy on notorious terrorist Mollaka (Sebastien Foucan) for his maiden voyage as a 007 agent, Bond boldly goes against MI6 policy to launch an independent investigation that finds him traversing the Bahamas in search of Mollaka's notoriously elusive terror cell. Subsequently led into the company of the mysterious Dimitrios (Simon Abkarian) and his exotic girlfriend, Solange (Caterina Murino), Bond soon realizes that he is closer than ever to locating well-guarded terrorist financier Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), the man who has personally bankrolled some of the most prevalent terrorist organizations on the planet. When Bond learns that Le Chiffre is planning to partake in an upcoming high-stakes poker game to be played at Montenegro's Le Casino Royale and use the winnings to establish his financial grip on the globe, M (Judi Dench) assigns beguiling agent Vesper (Eva Green) the task of watching over the fledgling agent as he plays against Le Chiffre in a covert attempt to destroy the nefarious gambler's well-established monetary stronghold in the underworld once and for all. Bond will need more than his legendary gambling skills in order to win this dangerous game, though, and after allying himself with local MI6 field agent Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini) and CIA operative Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright), the endlessly suave super-spy puts on his poker face for a high-stakes game of cards in which the stakes are not measured in dollars, but human lives(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Fido</title>
    <desc lang="en">In a 1950s-era alternate universe where domesticated zombies play a functional role in society by delivering the milk, carrying the mail, and even helping out with household chores, one boy is about to find out just how big of a personal responsibility "pet" ownership truly is. When the Earth passed through a cloud of space dust and the dead arose from their graves to devour the flesh of the living, it first seemed that all hope for humanity was lost. Society's rapid slide into chaos, however, was soon halted when scientists at a company called ZomCom created a special collar that turned the rampaging animated corpses docile. Now, thanks to ZomCom, everything is under control -- or is it? Timmy Robinson (K'Sun Ray) isn't quite convinced. Quiet and withdrawn, the skeptical young boy spends so much time locked away in his room that he's almost become invisible around the household. His mother Helen (Carrie-Anne Moss) has recently purchased a zombie to help keep things tidy around the house though, and when the creature attempts to engage the curious youngster in a game of catch, a friendship is forged between boy and zombie that finds the amiable gut-muncher nicknamed Fido (Billy Connolly) practically becoming a part of the family. Things take a turn for the worse however, when Fido's collar malfunctions and Timmy's neighbors begin dying in droves. When ZomCom's top zombie control specialist Mr. Bottoms (Henry Czerny) moves in across the street from Timmy, the increasingly complicated situation threatens to place a serious stumbling block in the path of human-zombie relations(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Actor Daniel Craig assumes the role formerly occupied by such screen greats as Sean Connery, Roger Moore, and Timothy Dalton to set out on the character's very first 007 mission. James Bond has earned his "00" status by masterfully executing a pair of death-defying professional assassinations. Now assigned the task of traveling to Madagascar to spy on notorious terrorist Mollaka (Sebastien Foucan) for his maiden voyage as a 007 agent, Bond boldly goes against MI6 policy to launch an independent investigation that finds him traversing the Bahamas in search of Mollaka's notoriously elusive terror cell. Subsequently led into the company of the mysterious Dimitrios (Simon Abkarian) and his exotic girlfriend, Solange (Caterina Murino), Bond soon realizes that he is closer than ever to locating well-guarded terrorist financier Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), the man who has personally bankrolled some of the most prevalent terrorist organizations on the planet. When Bond learns that Le Chiffre is planning to partake in an upcoming high-stakes poker game to be played at Montenegro's Le Casino Royale and use the winnings to establish his financial grip on the globe, M (Judi Dench) assigns beguiling agent Vesper (Eva Green) the task of watching over the fledgling agent as he plays against Le Chiffre in a covert attempt to destroy the nefarious gambler's well-established monetary stronghold in the underworld once and for all. Bond will need more than his legendary gambling skills in order to win this dangerous game, though, and after allying himself with local MI6 field agent Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini) and CIA operative Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright), the endlessly suave super-spy puts on his poker face for a high-stakes game of cards in which the stakes are not measured in dollars, but human lives(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Watchmen</title>
    <desc lang="en">300's Zack Snyder brings Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' critically acclaimed comic book Watchmen to the big screen, courtesy of DC Comics and Warner Bros. Pictures. Set in an alternate universe circa 1985, the film's world is a highly unstable one where a nuclear war is imminent between America and Russia. Superheroes have long been made to hang up their tights thanks to the government-sponsored Keene Act, but that all changes with the death of The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), a robust ex-hero commando whose mysterious free fall out a window perks the interest of one of the country's last remaining vigilantes, Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley). His investigation leads him to caution many of his other former costumed colleagues, including Dr. Manhattan, Night Owl (Patrick Wilson), Ozymandias (Matthew Goode), Sally Jupiter (Carla Gugino), and her daughter, The Silk Spectre (Malin Akerman). Heralded for bringing the world of superheroes into the literary world, Watchmen gave the super-powered mythos a real-life grounding that had been missing in mainstream comics to that point. The film adaptation had languished in one form of development hell or another for years after the book's release, with various directors on and off the project, including Terry Gilliam, David Hayter, and Darren Aronofsky, as well as Paul Greengrass, whose eventual dismissal stemmed from budget conflicts with the studio(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story</title>
    <desc lang="en">(2004) Peter La Fleur (VInce Vaughn) owns Average Joe's Gym, a scruffy establishment with a loyal clientele, while across the street Globo Gym, owned by White Goodman (Ben Stiller), is all glass and chrome and full of toned muscle. When La Fleur learns that he must pay the bank $50,000 in 30 days, Goodman is overjoyed: he can acquire his rival's building, knock it down and have the car park his gym's always needed.

In the year 859 A.D., as the Tang dynasty is beset by rebellion, Leo (Andy Lau) and Jin (Takeshi Kaneshiro) are a pair of lawmen who have been given the task of ferreting out the leaders of a revolutionary faction known as the Flying Daggers. Working on a tip that members of the group are working out of a brothel called the Peony Pavilion, Jin arrives there in disguise and is introduced to a beautiful blind dancer named Mei (Zhang Ziyi). After watching Mei's performance following several drinks, Jin drunkenly attempts to have his way with her, and Leo is forced to intervene. After gaining Mei's trust in a game of skill, Leo arrests her and informs her that she'll be tortured if she doesn't tell all she knows about the Flying Daggers. Jin responds by helping Mei break out of prison, but he has an ulterior motive -- by following her, Leo and Jin are certain she'll lead them to the Flying Daggers.

In 1948, Chico (voice of Eman Xor Ona) is a hotshot jazz pianist living in Havana, where his reputation as a ladies' man nearly outshines his talent at the keyboard. One night, Chico sees Rita (voice of Limara Meneses) singing "Love for Sale" at a nightclub, and it's love at first sight, though Rita is put off by the fact Chico already has a steady girl. However, when Chico backs Rita during a talent competition held at a Havana radio station, she realizes they're musically simpatico, and her heart soon follows her creative instincts. But after a quarrel with Chico, Rita is approach by Ron, an American talent scout who says he can make her a star, and she takes him up on the offer, traveling with him to New York.

    <title lang="en">Chico &amp; Rita</title>
    <desc lang="en">A love affair between two musicians spans six decades and numerous countries and political regimes in this animated romantic drama. In 1948, Chico (voice of Eman Xor Ona) is a hotshot jazz pianist living in Havana, where his reputation as a ladies' man nearly outshines his talent at the keyboard. One night, Chico sees Rita (voice of Limara Meneses) singing "Love for Sale" at a nightclub, and it's love at first sight, though Rita is put off by the fact Chico already has a steady girl. However, when Chico backs Rita during a talent competition held at a Havana radio station, she realizes they're musically simpatico, and her heart soon follows her creative instincts. But after a quarrel with Chico, Rita is approach by Ron, an American talent scout who says he can make her a star, and she takes him up on the offer, traveling with him to New York. Not wanting to lose Rita, Chico and his best friend Ramon head to New York City, but as Rita achieves fame and fortune in the United States, Chico finds the limelight is keeping them apart, and after returning to Cuba, the island's unstable political climate proves even better than Ron at keeping him away from Rita. Chico y Rita (aka Chico and Rita) was a collaboration between filmmaker and music producer Fernando Trueba, artist and designer Javier Mariscal, and animator and director Tono Errando, and features cartoon "cameo appearances" from a number of legendary jazz artists, including Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and Chano Pozo(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This entertaining teen comedy is set in the effervescent 1950s and involves the friendship of the introverted, clumsy Jonathan (Doug McKeon) and the nonconformist, extroverted Gene (Chris Nash). Jonathan's main objective is to win over the sexy Marilyn (Kelly Preston), in spite of his shyness, while Gene has his own love-life to maintain with his girlfriend Bunny (Catherine Mary Stewart) -- as well as counseling Jonathan on how to attract women. Gene also has to defend himself against Kenny (D.W.

As Jonathan and Gene handle life's challenges, the 1950s emerges as a potent presence on screen in the form of background setting, including movies and music, as well as dress and customs that were popular in that distinctive era(n)</desc>

Getting together a couple of accomplices -- Phyllis (Geena Davis), who admires Grimm for his audacity, and Loomis (Randy Quaid), a follower to Grimm's leader since grade school -- Grimm decides to rob a bank, pocket the money, get out of town and take off to tropical splendor. Dressing in a clown suit, Grimm devises a unique way to rob a bank -- taking a group of hostages at the bank and inviting the police to surround the bank. Amazingly, although pursued by a police chief (Jason Robards), the trio manage to pull off the robbery. However, the problems really start when they try to get from the bank to the airport -- which proves to be more difficult than the robbery(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Green Mile</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Frank Darabont, who made an acclaimed feature film debut with The Shawshank Redemption (1994), based on a Stephen King novel set in a prison, returns for a second feature, based on King's 1996 serialized novel set in a prison. In 1935, inmates at the Cold Mountain Correctional Facility call Death Row "The Green Mile" because of the dark green linoleum that tiles the floor. Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) is the head guard on the Green Mile when a new inmate is brought into his custody: John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), convicted of the sadistic murder of two young girls. Despite his size and the fearsome crimes for which he's serving time, Coffey seems to be a kind and well-mannered person who behaves more like an innocent child than a hardened criminal. Soon Edgecomb and two of his fellow guards, Howell (David Morse) and Stanton Barry Pepper), notice something odd about Coffey: he's able to perform what seem to be miracles of healing among his fellow inmates, leading them to wonder just what sort of person he could be, and if he could have committed the crimes with which he was charged. The Green Mile also stars James Cromwell as the warden; Michael Jeter, Sam Rockwell, and Graham Greene as inmates awaiting dates with the electric chair; and Harry Dean Stanton as a clever trustee(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich and Brian Cox star in this comedy action-thriller from director Robert Schwentke. Frank Moses quickly becomes all too familiar with the acronym RED - Retired, Extremely Dangerous - when his former CIA bosses send a crack squad to kill their best-ever hitman. But the extremely dangerous retiree proves more than a match for them. Realising the Agency won't give up so easily, he goes on the run and abducts, for her own safety, Sarah Ross, the pension worker he's fallen in love with over the phone. Still in the dark as to exactly why his country wants him dead, Moses sets out to find out, gathering around him a group of equally ageing-but-deadly friends and associates. Can the wily old foxes evade, overcome and/ or outgun the crème de la crème of a new generation's black ops people, led by William Cooper, to discover the truth? What follows is a non-stop onslaught of witty one-liners, gunshots and explosions... and a masterclass in knowing acting(n)</desc>
