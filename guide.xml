Operating at high altitude and deep inside France, RAF planes were halting the bulk of Luftwaffe bombers before they could reach the beaches. The files also reveal that the famous Spitfire took flight for the first time during the mission, and the agile fighter was a spectacular success.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">William Friedkin's multi-Oscar-winning gritty urban crime drama tells the real-life story of two New York narcotics cops' attempts to bring down a French drugs kingpin. Gene Hackman and Roy Scheider play detectives James 'Popeye' Doyle and Buddy Russo who, while investigating relatively minor-league drugs pushers, learn that a massive shipment of very pure heroin is about to arrive in the city. The heroin is being imported from Marseille by Alain Charnier, who is prepared to do anything, including murdering policemen, to get his narcotics out on the streets. But, although they know it's on its way, Doyle and Russo don't know how. Additionally, they make life more difficult for themselves by their warring with FBI agent Mulderig, who's also working the case. Hickman was the stunt driver pursued by Steve McQueen in Bullitt; and was also behind the wheel for the famous chase in this movie, which was shot in real traffic(n)</desc>

Each episode hones in on one particular category of weapon and discusses its background, evolution and strategic employment on the front lines. Episode Four, "Submarines," argues that many underwater subs carry more destructive potential than any other maritime crafts, and then underscores this argument by exploring such subtopics as the modern use of nuclear-powered aquatic torpedoes, the use of subs in undercover operations, and the evolution of these clandestine sea vessels from the German U-boats of World War II to the Virginia-Class attack subs of the 21st century that can easily exterminate entire fleets of ships with a single launch(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Sue Barker presents the latest from the All England Club, where day two continues, with the focus on the seeded players in Centre Court and Court One. The absence of seven-time champion Serena Williams means a break to the traditional Centre Court schedule for day two, but the crowd can still expect a galaxy of stars to take to the grass for the third Grand Slam event of the year, including matches from the top half of the ladies' draw and the bottom half of the men's draw. Roger Federer will be full of confidence following his recent tournament victory on grass at the Gerry Weber Open, and he begins his attempt to win an eighth Wimbledon title by facing Alexandr Dolgopolov, while Novak Djokovic, Milos Raonic, Dominic Thiem and Juan Martin Del Potro will also get their respective campaigns under way.(n)</desc>

Weather permitting, the line-up for the second round will be decided by the end of the day, with the bottom half of the men's draw and the top half of the ladies' taking place today. Day two traditionally sees the defending ladies' champion begin the defence of her title, but Serena Williams is absent this year due to pregnancy, so top seed Angelique Kerber will be first up on Centre Court, as she faces a qualifier. Other matches scheduled to take place in the ladies draw today include Karolina Pliskova v Evgeniya Rodina, Agnieszka Radwanska v Jelena Jankovic, and Great Britain's Katie Boulter v Christina McHale. The commentary team includes Tim Henman, Barry Davies, Peter Fleming, Tracy Austin and Andrew Cotter.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">On May 6, 1954, Roger Bannister became the first man to run a mile in less than four minutes. Since that day, more people have reached the summit of Everest than have matched Bannister's feat. But as this documentary reveals, before the lunchtime-trained runner could make history, he first had to survive the Second World War. His story is told by Bannister himself, as well as his rival John Landy, Sebastian Coe, and Chris Chataway, who was Bannister's friend and pacesetter - among many others.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">British architects reveal how they helped craft the modern world with their vision, beginning by discussing their latest work including London's `Cheesegrater' skyscraper, Spaceport America in New Mexico and the KK100 in China. Norman Foster, Richard Rogers, Nicholas Grimshaw, Michael Hopkins and Terry Farrell were all born in the 1930s and were shaped by the optimism of the post-war years and the 1960s counter-culture, and began their careers as outsiders and radicals. They tell the stories of the designs for the Pompidou Centre in Paris, Willis Faber &amp; Dumas Headquarters in Ipswich and Hopkins House in Hampstead.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">David Dimbleby investigates the importance of the sea to trade and to the individual livelihoods of coastal communities. He sails along the west coast of Scotland, starting at Craobh Haven and along the Crinan Canal, a waterway designed by East Lothian engineer John Rennie to take 120 miles off the journey from the west coast to Glasgow and safely avoid the turbulent waters around the Mull of Kintyre. He also climbs aboard the last working sea-going Clyde puffer, where he earns his keep shovelling coal in the steam room, and reflects on the role played by the river in both trade and shipbuilding.(n)</desc>

Also featured are the world's most expensive pet accessories and the sad story of Kalu the chimp - who missed out on an inheritance of £40million when its owner revealed she had lost her entire fortune.(n)</desc>

With their fiery fusion of Latin and hip-hop moves, Lina Cruz (Christina Milian) and her best friends Gloria (Vanessa Born) and Treyvonetta (Gabrielle Dennis) are about to lead the East L.A. high school cheer squad to victory at one of the most prominent competitions in the nation. But just as the crew is about to take the world by storm, Lina's mother remarries and the family makes the move to Florida. Once there, Lina quickly realizes that the Malibu Vista High Sea Lions aren't anywhere near as talented as her old cheer squad. Now, in order to transform the Sea Lions into a championship team, Lina must teach them the moves needed to knock the award-winning Jaguar cheer squad and their trash-talking captain Avery (Rachele Brooke Smith) out of the top spot. When Lina and Avery's brother Evan (Cody Longo) becomes romantically involved, the competition between the two girls really begins to heat up. With the stakes higher than ever before, Lina hatches a scheme to take her team all the way to the top and prove that they have what it takes to become true champions(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Actor Hart Bochner turns director in the satirical Animal House update P.C.U.. Per the title, the film takes place on the campus of a University where, thanks to militant dean Jessica Walter, Political Correctness has reached ridiculous proportions. A group of dorm-room cutups, wallowing in their uncorrectness, declares war on the uptight student activists who call the shots. Saturday Night Live's David Spade is among the leading players; while he's funnier here than in his costarring stints in Chris Farley's films, he doesn't have much to work with. The subject matter covered in P.C.U. has already been tackled, with far funnier results, on Bill Maher's cable-TV weekly Politically Incorrect(n)</desc>

Little do they know that two of the Alley's residents are retired martial arts experts and soon the fists and feet are flying in knockabout fights that owe as much to Kill Bill (some of the wire work is done by Yuen Wo Ping, who worked on Tarantino's film) as they do to classic Hollywood silent comedies. Film fans can enjoy Chow's references to films ranging from Top Hat to The Shining while the rest can just enjoy a wildly entertaining romp. In Cantonese with English subtitles(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Liam Neeson reunites with Unknown director Jaume Collet-Serra) for this airborne thriller about an Air Marshal racing to stop the villain who has framed him as a hijacker during a non-stop flight from New York to London. From the moment we first meet Air Marshal Bill Marks (Neeson), it's apparent his nerves are frayed. After furtively knocking back a stiff drink in the airport parking lot, he enters the crowded terminal to board a plane bound for London. Carefully observing his fellow travelers along the way, Marks eventually ends up seated next to nervous flyer Jen (Julianne Moore), who begins to breathe easier once she's seated near a window. Later, as the plane hits cruising altitude, Marks receives a mysterious text message stating that a passenger on the flight will be killed every 20 minutes unless $150 million is deposited into a secure bank account. But the harder Marks works to identify a suspect, the deeper he implicates himself in what becomes a deadly hostage crisis unfolding at 30,000 feet over the Atlantic Ocean. When it's revealed that the account for the ransom money is in Marks' name, the FAA revokes his marshal status and the media paints him as a hijacker. As the frightened passengers begin to turn on Marks, he suspects the true culprit may not even be on the plane. And with the help of Jen and perceptive airline hostess Nancy (Michelle Dockery), he attempts to clear his name and protect the passengers by any means possible(n)</desc>

They prepare a plate of food that represents who they are as their calling card and choose one box of ingredients - either sweet or savoury - to rustle up a surprise dish in the invention test after John Torode demonstrates what he would do with the same produce. Two are then sent home, leaving the remaining four to serve dinner for Natalie Coleman, Dhruv Baker and James Nathan, MasterChef champions in 2013, 2010 and 2008 respectively, before Gregg Wallace and John decide which pair have made it through.(n)</desc>

But the host of the show, Prem Kumar (Anil Kapoor) is convinced he's cheating and hands him over to the police to beat the truth out of him. Jamal reveals that the right answer to each question has come from a significant part of his life, from when he and his brother Salim were orphaned after their mother was killed in religious violence. As he continues his story, Jamal reveals how he knows each answer; how he fell in love with Latika, an orphaned girl from whom he was later separated; and how his brother Salim took the path of violence as a gangster's gunman. But as Jamal is returned to the studio for the last question, Salim finally repays his brother's trust. As well as the outstanding Patel, Jamal is played in different stages of his life by Tanay Hemant Gharu and Ayush Mahesh Khedekar; Salim is played by Madhur Mittal, Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala and Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail; Latika is played by Frieda Pinto, Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar and Rubina Ali, all of whom turn in stunning performances.

But the host of the show, Prem Kumar (Anil Kapoor) is convinced he's cheating and hands him over to the police to beat the truth out of him. Jamal reveals that the right answer to each question has come from a significant part of his life, from when he and his brother Salim were orphaned after their mother was killed in religious violence. As he continues his story, Jamal reveals how he knows each answer; how he fell in love with Latika, an orphaned girl from whom he was later separated; and how his brother Salim took the path of violence as a gangster's gunman. But as Jamal is returned to the studio for the last question, Salim finally repays his brother's trust. As well as the outstanding Patel, Jamal is played in different stages of his life by Tanay Hemant Gharu and Ayush Mahesh Khedekar; Salim is played by Madhur Mittal, Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala and Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail; Latika is played by Frieda Pinto, Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar and Rubina Ali, all of whom turn in stunning performances.

    <title lang="en">The Good Guy</title>
    <desc lang="en">After executive producing the acclaimed documentary Manda Bala and the J.M. Coetzee adaptation Disgrace, Julio DePietro makes his feature debut as a writer-director with The Good Guy, a drama about ambitious young Wall Streeters fighting each other -- and sometimes their own decent nature -- to get ahead in the world. Our narrator, Tommy (Scott Porter of TV's Friday Night Lights), is young, clever, charming, and attractive. He's got a smart, pretty girlfriend, Beth (Alexis Bledel of Gilmore Girls), an urban conservationist. He's also very good at his investment broker job, impressing his ruthless, cynical boss, Cash (erstwhile "Brat Pack" member Andrew McCarthy). When a key member of Tommy's sales team suddenly leaves for a competitor, Tommy needs to fill his spot quickly, and takes a chance on the bumbling Daniel (Bryan Greenberg, Bride Wars), a former Marine and computer geek who seems a bit naïve about high finance and a bit nervous around women. Tommy takes Daniel under his wing, showing him how to dress, where to socialize, and how to charm attractive women. Their relationship is threatened when Daniel begins spending more time with Beth, joining her book club, and becoming her confidant. Tommy begins to question his decision to share his wisdom with Daniel, while Daniel is forced to decide what success really means to him, and where his loyalties lie. The Good Guy also stars Anna Chlumsky (In the Loop) and Aaron Yoo (Disturbia). The film had its world premiere at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Hollywood Ending</title>
    <desc lang="en">A down-on-his luck auteur gets one more chance at the big time -- provided his neuroses don't swallow him whole -- in Woody Allen's 33rd feature release, Hollywood Ending. Allen plays Val Waxman, a one-time cinematic genius who's resorted to taking advertisement work to pay the bills for himself and his airhead live-in girlfriend, Lori (Debra Messing). Val finds his luck is about to change, however, when he receives the script for The City Never Sleeps, a period noir set against the backdrop of 1940s New York City. It seems his ex-wife, Ellie (Tea Leoni), now an executive at Galaxy Pictures, has been pulling for him to direct the picture, claiming he's the only man who can do justice to the script. She even manages to convince her boyfriend, Hal (Treat Williams), Galaxy's high-powered studio head, to take a chance on Val's "unique vision." Just when the cameras are ready to roll, however, Val finds that unique vision in jeopardy -- literally -- as he's struck with a psychosomatic case of blindness. When physicians and psychiatrists fail to cure him, Val contrives a scheme to forge ahead with the picture, for fear of blowing his one last chance at greatness. Hollywood Ending co-stars George Hamilton and Mark Rydell(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Hotel for Dogs</title>
    <desc lang="en">Adapted from author Lois Duncan's 1971 children's book of the same name, director Thor Freudenthal's Hotel for Dogs follows two mischievous orphans as they attempt to hide dozens of stray dogs in an abandoned hotel. Disheartened by their new guardians' announcement that pets are strictly forbidden, 16-year-old Andi (Emma Roberts) and her younger brother, Bruce (Jake T. Austin), race to find a home for their loyal dog Friday. Fortunately for Friday, there's an abandoned hotel just around the corner, and Bruce possesses just the kind of mechanical smarts needed to transform the rundown inn into a four-star retreat for canines. For a while, Friday and his friends have it made, but when the neighbors start to get suspicious, Andi and Bruce resort to every trick in the book in order to prevent their secret from being discovered. Don Cheadle, Emma Roberts, and Lisa Kudrow star in a family-friendly film penned by screenwriter Jeff Lowell(n)</desc>

Meanwhile Jesus (Cisco Reyes) and his girlfriend Chita (Yasmin Deliz), the intended recipients of the cocaine, set out to procure the package before notorious drug lord Bodego Diablo (Emilio Rivera) realizes it's gone missing.

Alicia (Mia Kirshner), Hadley (Meredith Monroe), Julianne (Rachel True), and Sydney (Dominique Swain) are four students enrolled in the same sociology class at Colby University, an exclusive and respected college in the Carolinas. Alicia is a local girl born into modest circumstances who struggles to make ends meet and rarely gets a second look from the male students on campus, while Hadley, Julianne, and Sydney are close friends who all come from wealthy families and seem more concerned with partying than their studies. Alicia and Hadley are paired up to work on their semester project for the class, which is to be centered around the theme "Lead, Follow, or Get Out of the Way." As part of the project, Hadley decides to befriend Alicia, and brings her into her social circle. At first, Alicia seems more than grateful for the attention of her new friends, and blooms under the influence of Hadley, Julianne, and Sydney. But it isn't long before Alicia's personality begins to shift; she develops a powerful appetite for drugs and alcohol, and soon begins taking advantage of her new friendships. Things come to a head when Alicia seduces Sydney's boyfriend, Josh (Oliver Hudson), and soon Alicia ends up in the hospital after OD'ing on drugs. Artie Bonner (Taye Diggs), a local sheriff, begins looking into Alicia's case, convinced that her near-fatal accident with drugs was no accident at all(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Based on the 1997 National Book Award-nominated novel of the same name by Diane Johnson (co-writer of the script for Stanley Kubrick's The Shining), Le Divorce is a romantic comedy from director James Ivory. Revisiting the "Americans in France" theme that Ivory explored in 1998's A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries, the film stars Kate Hudson as Isabel Walker. When she receives word that her pregnant poetess sister Roxy (Naomi Watts) has been left by her philandering French husband, artist Charles-Henri de Persand (Melvil Poupaud), Isabel offers her help and moral support. As the depressive Roxy struggles with the separation proceedings -- which include the rights to ownership of a work of art that's a family heirloom -- Isabel takes a job with author Olivia Pace and has a fling with the bohemian Yves (Romain Duris). But things get complicated when the younger, more impudent sister decides instead to pursue Charles' uncle, the snooty, married diplomat Edgar (Thierry Lhermitte), and when a mysterious man (Matthew Modine) starts stalking Roxy. Eventually, the rest of the plucky Walker clan has to come to the aid of the siblings. Stockard Channing and Sam Waterston co-star(n)</desc>

Mystery writer Jessica Fletcher (Angela Lansbury) is given the opportunity to solve her 286th murder, this one connected with a San Francisco fine-arts radio station. The station's ruthless new manager has elected to boost ratings by changing the outlet's image and format, and by firing a number of employees who are deemed too old for a hard-rock audience. So just guess who gets murdered. . .just guess! "Death by Demographics" is an ironic title for the final hour-long episode of Murder, She Wrote, which had been cancelled by CBS after 12 seasons and 264 episodes because it "skewed old" in the ratings(n)</desc>

This documentary, like the feature, explores the legendary events that transpired in the year 480 B.C., when a legion of Greek city-states took on the forces of the Persian Empire at the pass of Thermopylae, defending itself successfully despite an overwhelming disadvantage in terms of battalion size. This nonfiction work recounts the tactical strategies that accounted for the Greeks' lengthy holdout, and utilizes both digital animation and dramatic reenactments to relay the thrilling story(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Shutter Island</title>
    <desc lang="en">Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio team up for a fourth time for this adaptation of Shutter Island, a novel by Dennis Lehane (Mystic River). The film opens in 1954 as World War II veteran and current federal marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his new partner, Chuck (Mark Ruffalo), ferry to Shutter Island, a water-bound mental hospital housing the criminally insane. They have been asked to investigate the disappearance of Rachel Solando (Emily Mortimer), a patient admitted to the asylum after she murdered her three children. As Teddy quizzes Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley), the head of the institution, he begins to suspect that the authorities in charge might not be giving him the whole truth, and that a terrible fate may befall all the patients in the spooky Ward C -- a unit devoted to the most heinous of the hospital's inmates. Complicating matters further, Teddy has a secret of his own -- the arsonist who murdered his wife is incarcerated on Shutter Island. Driven to confront his wife's killer, and stranded on the island because of a hurricane, Teddy must unravel the secrets of the eerie place before succumbing to his own madness. Max von Sydow, Emily Mortimer, Michelle Williams, Patricia Clarkson, and Jackie Earle Haley round out the supporting cast(n)</desc>

Unfortunately, the director of the promo, an overambitious young woman named Ronnie (Belita Moreno), has some rather curious notions as to what will "sell" on television--and these include dressing Jesse (John Stamos) in drag and replacing baby Michelle with a "professional kid".

This is the first episode in which Stephanie utters her familiar catchphrase "How rude"--and rude DJ is, in abundance, until Jesse (John Stamos) and Joey (David Coulier) step in to resolve the problem(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A young bride says "until death do us part," but finds that doesn't necessarily put an end to her romance in this offbeat blend of horror, comedy, and romance. Danny (Graham Sibley) and Denise (Tracy Coogan) are a young couple who have just gotten married and head off to a beachside bungalow to celebrate their honeymoon. While enjoying a sunny afternoon on the beach, Danny and Denise's idyllic getaway takes a turn for the worse when a monster rises from the ocean and attacks Danny. The creature spews poison into Danny's mouth, and soon the new husband is dead. But Danny isn't gone for long -- he unexpectedly regains consciousness, but Denise soon learns that her new mate has become a flesh-eating zombie, and that the former vegetarian now has a taste for human beings. But Danny still has one link with the world of the living -- he loves Denise with all his heart, and struggles to keep his monstrous appetites under control for her sake, while Denise remains deeply in love with Danny, and tries to adjust to the strange and monstrous changes taking place in the man she married. Zombie Honeymoon was written and directed by Dave Gebroe, who was inspired to make the film by his sister, a horror film fan who lost her husband in a surfing accident not long after they were wed(n)</desc>

Things take a turn for the worse when the dead return to stake their claim on the Earth, and though the chaos that follows threatens to swallow up all of England, it's up to Shaun to keep his cool and prove himself once and for all by successfully rescuing Liz and his mother. With his trusty roommate by his side, nothing -- not even the living dead -- can stand between Shaun and the two most important women in his life(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Shaun of the Dead</title>
    <desc lang="en">It's often said that the true character of a man is only revealed in times of dire crisis, and for likable, lovelorn loser Shaun (Simon Pegg), that moment of reckoning came when the dead rose from their slumber to feast on the flesh of the living. A hapless electronics store employee who spends most of his spare time downing pints at the local pub with his roommate, Ed (Nick Frost), Shaun's life seems to fall apart when he is dumped by his girlfriend, Liz (Kate Ashfield), and his obnoxious stepfather, Philip (Bill Nighy), shows up to berate him for not being more attentive to his caring mother Barbara (Penelope Wilton) -- especially since he forgot to send flowers for her birthday. Things take a turn for the worse when the dead return to stake their claim on the Earth, and though the chaos that follows threatens to swallow up all of England, it's up to Shaun to keep his cool and prove himself once and for all by successfully rescuing Liz and his mother. With his trusty roommate by his side, nothing -- not even the living dead -- can stand between Shaun and the two most important women in his life(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Will Ferrell offers his fans a change of pace as he takes on a rare dramatic role as a man struggling to hold his life together. Nick Halsey (Ferrell) was once a successful salesman with a happy marriage, but years of drinking are finally catching up with him, as he's fired from his job and his wife has decided she's had enough. Nick's wife has kicked him out of the house and moved all his possessions onto their front lawn; hoping retain a bit of dignity and maybe raise some cash as he plots his next move, Nick puts a yard sale sign on his stuff and tries to convince the neighbors (and the cops) that he's simply selling some junk he doesn't need anymore. As Nick makes believe he isn't homeless in between beers, he strikes up a friendship with a kid from the neighborhood (Christopher Jordan Wallace), tries to reconnect with a girl he loved in high school (Laura Dern), and bonds with his neighbor Samantha (Rebecca Hall), who is pregnant and struggling to get by while her husband is away on business. Based on a short story by Raymond Carver, Everything Must Go was the first feature film from director and screenwriter Dan Rush(n)</desc>

As their power and influence grows, they must consider teaming with established media sources, especially when they are sent documents that would reveal ultra-sensitive state secrets from some of the world's most-powerful governments.

    <title lang="en">The Great Raid</title>
    <desc lang="en">John Dahl directed this war drama based on the true story of one of the most daring military actions of World War II. In the waning days of World War II, General Douglas MacArthur chose to make good on a pledge that he made in 1942 -- that he would return to the Philippines after he and his troops were forced to retreat. However, MacArthur's determination was more than a matter of pride. Over 500 American soldiers were being held in Cabanatuan, a notoriously brutal prisoner of war camp in the Philippines operated by the Japanese army, and MacArthur wanted to see to it that they made it home. MacArthur chose Lt. Col. Henry Mucci (Benjamin Bratt) to lead the Sixth Ranger Battalion on a mission 30 miles behind enemy lines to infiltrate Cabanatuan and liberate the American prisoners. With the help of Capt. Prince (James Franco), Mucci leads his men on a life-or-death raid against forces known for their savagery. The Great Raid was based on William B. Breuer's book The Great Raid on Cabanatuan: Rescuing the Doomed Ghosts of Bataan and Corregidor, and also stars Joseph Fiennes, Connie Nielsen, and Marton Csokas(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Where Do We Go Now?</title>
    <desc lang="en">Women try to persuade their men to put a stop to war in this fusion of comedy and drama from director, screenwriter, and actress Nadine Labaki. Amale (Labaki) runs a café in a small Lebanese village where the local women, both Christian and Muslim, get together to talk, swap ideas, and share grief as the number who've lost sons or husbands in frequent skirmishes continues to grow. The fighting between religious and political factions has been going on for years, and one day Amale and her friends Afaf (Layla Hakim), Saydeh (Antoinette Noufaily), Takla (Claude Baz Moussawbaa), and Yvonne (Yvonne Maalouf) decide it's time to stop talking about the fighting and do something to bring it to a halt. The local women join forces to distract their men, convinced if they put their minds on other things they won't worry so much about killing. Their efforts range from serving hashish-laced baked goods at a community get-together to hiring Ukrainian dancers to show off their charms to the menfolk. After a young man is killed in a gun battle, the women realize they need to take a stronger stand if they intend to make their home safe again; meanwhile, Christian Amale unwittingly strikes a blow for religious unity when she falls for handsome Muslim Rabih (Julien Farhat). Et Maintenant On Va Ou? (aka Where Do We Go Now?) won the People's Choice Award at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival(n)</desc>

He owns a flashy Americanized Italian eatery which offers customers entertainment and mediocre food and suggests that he invite his 'friend', a big jazz musician, to play at the brothers' restaurant. Excited, the brothers set about preparing for the big night, inviting friends along for the event. Primo is planning a feast fit for a king with enough food to feed the whole of Italy! When the guests arrive, the food and drink begins to flow and the crowd enjoy a riotous night of dancing and singing as the brothers discover what really matters in life(n)</desc>

As a child, Max Skinner (Freddie Highmore) was taught to appreciate the finer things in life while wandering the vineyard estate of his sophisticated uncle Henry (Albert Finney). Life has a strange way or turning out how you least expect it to though, and 25 years later, Max (Russell Crowe) is now a prosperous moneyman wheeling and dealing in the cutthroat world of London business. When Max learns that Henry has recently passed away and that he has been named the sole beneficiary of his late uncle's modest estate, the keen businessman hastily arranges a flight to France in order to assess the value of the old property and get it prepped for sale. After Max arrives to find the vineyard in a crumbling state of disrepair, his troubles are further compounded by the stubbornness of gruff estate winemaker M. Duflot (Didier Bourdon) and the unexpected arrival of a determined California beauty named Christie (Abbie Cornish), who presents herself as a long-lost cousin while making a dubious claim to Henry's estate. Meanwhile, the overstressed Max reluctantly finds himself falling for local café owner and town siren Fanny (Marion Cotillard), whose formidable guard is quickly worn down by the smitten beneficiary(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Great White Hype</title>
    <desc lang="en">Boxing is more than just a sport -- it's also a business and a con game in this satirical comedy. Rev. Fred Sultan (Samuel L. Jackson) is a shrewd boxing promoter and manager whose meal ticket is heavyweight champion James "The Grim Reaper" Roper (Damon Wayans), a fighter whose skill and confidence significantly outstrips his intelligence. While the top-ranked contender for Roper's title is Marvin Shabazz (Michael Jace), Sultan isn't too keen on the idea of Shabazz fighting Roper -- it seems that both fighters are black, and Sultan's figures show that mixed race matches stir up a lot more media attention and pay-per-view customers. Eager to find a white challenger for Roper, Sultan digs up Terry Conklin (Peter Berg), who won a Golden Gloves fight against Roper many years ago but is now out of the game and fronting a rock band called Massive Head Wound. Thanks to a few bribes and a couple of fixed fights, Sultan is able to arrange for Conklin to be next in line to battle "The Grim Reaper." However, Conklin is taking his renewed career as a boxer quite seriously, while Roper, convinced that Conklin doesn't stand a chance, has let himself go and gained a lot of weight. Suddenly Sultan realizes that Roper might just lose the piece-of-cake fight he's so carefully arranged, while journalist Mitchell Kane (Jeff Goldblum) smells a rat in Conklin's sudden rise to ranking status. Jon Lovitz, Cheech Marin, and Corbin Bernsen highlight the supporting cast, while members of the well-regarded alternative rock band Local H appear as Massive Head Wound(n)</desc>

To show his appreciation, Pacelli gives Darrell a job -- serving as bodyguard for this beautiful daughter, Dolly (Emmanuelle Chriqui). A short-lived romance blooms between Darrell and Dolly, but it isn't long before the couple are quarreling, which makes Pacelli more than a bit unhappy with his new hire. However, Pacelli also has a mob war and a disloyal and ambitious young lieutenant to deal with, and Darrell soon finds Pacelli's problems become his problems too.

Given to telling whoppers, Thomas finds himself in a boy-who-cried-wolf dilemma when he overhears two spies plotting to smuggle valuable info out of the US. When he can't get his own father Dabney Coleman to believe him, Thomas turns disconsolately to a computer game called "Cloak and Dagger" and begins to fantasize, imagining that he is in cahoots with secret agent Jack Flack, also played by Coleman. Finally coming to grips with the fact that the mythical Jack Flack cannot help him this time, Thomas takes on the spies with the help of his schoolmates, who are also "Cloak and Dagger" addicts. Cloak and Dagger is a heavily disguised remake of 1949's The Window; both are based on the Cornell Woolrich story The Boy Cried Murder(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Once upon a Time</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Once upon a Time. Twilight Zone's only foray into old-time slapstick comedy, this episode stars the great Buster Keaton as Woodrow Mulligan, a 19th century janitor fed up with the hustle, bustle, and noise of "modern life." While working in the laboratory of scientists Gilbert and Fenwick (Milton Parsons and George E. Stone), Woodrow stumbles upon a newly-invented time helmet. Reasoning that he will enjoy more peace and quiet in the future, Woodrow activates the helmet and ends up in 1962 -- where, not surprisingly, he doesn't find things to his liking! The first half of this episode is delightfully staged in the manner of a silent movie, replete with flickery photography, gag subtitles, and a rinky-tink piano score (written by William Lava, performed by Ray Turner). The 1962 sequences are done in full sound, and they aren't quite as satisfying, though there's a terrific recreation of a key gag from the 1918 Fatty Arbuckle/Buster Keaton two-reeler The Garage, with Stanley Adams standing in for Arbuckle. Most of the episode was directed by silent-movie veteran Norman Z. McLeod, with the exception of an intrusive sequence set in a repair shop, which was helmed by Les Goodwins. Written by Rod Serling, "Once Upon a Time" was first telecast on December 15, 1961(n)</desc>

Forever yearning for the days of his idyllic childhood, Horace is at last able to relive his youth, only to find that things weren't quite as rosy as he remembered. Pat Hingle played the old Art Carney role in the Twilight Zone version of "The Incredible World of Horace Ford," which was first telecast April 18, 1963(n)</desc>

Ed Wynn stars as septuagenarian Sam Forstmann, who resists his family's efforts to sell his precious grandfather clock. It seems that the clock began running on the day that Sam was born, and he is convinced that if its stops running, so will he. As originally conceived by George Clayton Johnson, this episode was to have had a "cyclical" ending, with Sam's death coinciding with the birth of his grandson. But as rewritten by Richard de Roy, "Ninety Years Without Slumbering" settled for a "happier" -- and weaker -- denouement. Watch for Dick Wilson, TV's "Mr. Whipple," as a moving man(n)</desc>

When His Satanic Majesty makes an appearance in the form of the jovial Mr. Cadwallader (Thomas Gomez), Walter enters into a contract whereby he will be given perfect health and immortality. Unfortunately, Walter soon discovers that eternal life isn't all it's cracked up to be, while his wife Ethel suffers spectacularly from Walter's efforts to "spice up" his existence. Several 1960s TV icons appear in supporting roles, including commercial "stars" Virginia Christine (aka Mrs. Olsen) and Dick Wilson) (Mr. Whipple), The Beverly Hillbillies' Raymond Bailey, and McHale's Navy's Joe Flynn. First telecast November 6, 1959, "Escape Clause" was written by Rod Serling(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">The Last Rites of Jeff Myrtlebank</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The Last Rites of Jeff Myrtlebank. Writer-director Montgomery Pittman's final Twilight Zone offering was the bucolic comedy "The Last Rites of Jeff Myrtlebank." As the youthful title character (James Best) lies in his coffin during his funeral, the assembled mourners listen to the droning words of the local pastor (William Fawcett) -- whereupon Jeff sits bolt upright, very much alive! Doc Bolton (Edgar Buchanan) assumes that he made a misdiagnosis when he declared Jeff dead, but the townsfolk are convinced that the boy has been possessed by the devil, especially after Jeff handily beats up his longtime antagonist Orgram Gatewood (Lance Fuller), something he has never been able to do before. Only Orgram's cousin Comfort (played by director Pittman's daughter-in-law Sherry Jackson) remains unafraid of Jeff, but even she begins to have her doubts during the diabolically amusing final scenes. Blessed with a semi-satirical harmonica score by Tommy Morgan, "The Last Rites of Jeff Myrtlebank" made its first TV appearance on February 23, 1962(n)</desc>

Lee Marvin stars as western gunslinger Conny Miller, who upon arriving in a flea-bitten town for a showdown with outlaw Pinto Sykes, is told that Sykes is already dead. Convinced that Miller is a coward who never really wanted to catch up with him, the dying Sykes had challenged Miller to visit his grave, warning that he would reach up from the ground and drag Miller in with him. Goaded by the townspeople, the terrified Miller ventures into the graveyard in the dead of night. Western-movie regulars Strother Martin and Lee Van Cleef appear in key supporting roles(n)</desc>

A neighborhood full of friendly people degenerates into a mob when Maple Street is suddenly plagued by strange and seemingly pre-planned power outages. Steve Brand (Claude Akins) tries to act as the voice of reason, but he is shouted down by his hotheaded neighbor Charlie (Jack Weston). Meanwhile, suspicion is cast upon young Tommy (Jan Handzlik), a science-fiction fanatic who apparently knows more than he should about the recurring power failures. Even after the passage of four decades, this Rod Serling-scripted Twilight Zone episode has lost none of its impact, and it is justifiably one of the series' best-remembered installments. Keep an eye out for future M*A*S*H producer-director Burt Metcalfe in a featured role. "The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street" originally aired March 4, 1960(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Eye of the Beholder</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Eye of the Beholder. An irreducable masterpiece, the Rod Serling-scripted Twilight Zone episode "The Eye of the Beholder" takes place in a hospital in the dead of night. The protagonist is Janet Tyler, who, having been shunned by society because of her hideous ugliness, has just undergone extensive plastic surgery. Knowing full well that she will be shipped off to a community of fellow "outcasts" if the surgery is unsuccessful, Janet tensely awaits the results as the bandages are slowly removed from her face. Even after repeated viewings, this landmark episode loses none of his power and poignancy, with Douglas Heyes' surehanded direction matched by Bernard Herrmann's brilliant musical score. First telecast November 11, 1960, "The Eye of the Beholder" was rerun in the summer of 1962 -- when, to avoid tipping off the punch line, the episode reverted to its working title, "A Private World of Darkness."(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">I Sing the Body Electric</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">I Sing the Body Electric. Though he'd originally intended to write several scripts for the original Twilight Zone, Ray Bradbury's sole contribution to the series was this sensitive adaptation of his own short story "I Sing the Body Electric!" Hoping to fill the void left by the death of his wife, a widower (David White) takes his children to Robots Unlimited to purchase an "electric grandmother" for the kids. The younger children (Charles Herbert) and Dana Dillaway) are delighted with their robot granny (Josephine Hutchinson), but older daughter Anna (Veronica Cartwright) is sullen and resentful -- until "Grandma" proves herself to be more human than most humans. Though the episode is generally successful, no one connected with it was satisfied, least of all director James Sheldon, who felt that star Josephine Hutchinson was not quite right in the leading role. In addition, an earlier scene with June Vincent as the kids' aunt Nedra didn't "play" on film, necessitating an expensive reshoot, directed by William F. Claxton, with Doris Packer replacing Vincent. All in all, however, "I Sing the Body Electric!" pleased the crowd when it first aired on May 18, 1962, though a much-later 60-minute TV version, "The Electric Grandmother" (1980), was closer to the spirit of the Bradbury original(n)</desc>

In the midst of a surprise birthday party, the revellers are shocked to hear a Civil Defense announcement on the radio, declaring that America is under attack from UFOs. Only Dr. Stockton (Larry Gates) has had the foresight to build a bomb shelter, and before long, he and his family are besieged by desperate neighbors, demanding to be allowed to take refuge in Stockton's cellar. As tensions reach a fever pitch, all of the suppressed hostilities and prejudices of the neighbors come rushing to the surface -- a dangerous situation reminiscent of the finale of the first-season episode "The Monsters are Due on Maple Street," minus the extraterrestrial punchline. Written by Rod Serling, "The Shelter" first aired on September 29, 1961(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Nightmare at 20,000 Feet. Cited by many aficionados as the all-time best Twilight Zone episode, "Nightmare at 20,000 Feet" benefits immeasurably from a bravura performance by star William Shatner. While travelling through rough weather on a passenger plane, former mental patient Bob Wilson (Shatner) peers out of his window -- and sees a hideous gremlin balanced on the plane's wing. Doubting his own sanity, Bob tries to convince himself that he is merely hallucinating. . .and then the gremlin begins to tear the wing apart. Adapted by Richard Matheson from his own short story, "Nightmare at 20,000 Feet" was originally telecast October 11, 1963. The basic story was later incorporated into the omnibus theatrical feature Twilight Zone: The Movie (1983) and has since been mercilessly lampooned in TV comedy series ranging from The Simpsons to 3rd Rock from the Sun(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">The Dummy</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The Dummy. Bearing traces of such earlier film offerings as The Great Gabbo and Dead of Night, the eerie Twilight Zone episode "The Dummy" was scripted by Rod Serling from a story by Lee Polk. Cliff Robertson stars as Jerry Etherson, a nightclub ventriloquist with a predilection for liquor and emotional problems. Weighing heavily upon Jerry is the fact that he feels threatened by his dummy Willy -- as well he should, since Willy seems to be doing all his talking on his own. Hoping to rid himself of his little nemesis, Jerry adopts a new wooden companion, Goofy Goggles, but Willy isn't about to be dismissed so easily. The supporting cast features future Gomer Pyle USMC regular Frank Sutton and perennial starlet Edy Williams. Stylishly directed by former actor Abner Biberman, "The Dummy" first aired May 4, 1962(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">The After Hours</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The After Hours. Bearing traces of the classic John Collier short story "Evening Primrose", Rod Serling's "The After Hours" was seen as the June 10, 1960, episode of Twilight Zone. While shopping in a big department store, Marsha White (Anne Francis) is inexorably drawn to the store's Ninth Floor, where a mysterious saleswoman (Elizabeth Allen) seems to recognize her. There's just one problem -- according to officious floorwalker Armbruster (James Milhollin), the store doesn't have a Ninth Floor! The makeup artistry of William Tuttle is utilized to the utmost in the episode's chilling (yet somehow touching) final scene(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The New Exhibit. First telecast April 4, 1963, this grim 60-minute Twilight Zone installment would seem to be more suited to Alfred Hitchcock Presents or Thriller. Martin Balsam stars as Martin Senescu, curator of a "chamber of horrors" wax museum. Upon learning that the museum is to be demolished, Martin takes his favorite wax statues -- those of Jack the Ripper, Henri "Bluebeard" Landru, and ax murderer Albert W. Hicks -- to his home, much to the dismay of his wife Emma (Maggie Mahoney). Not long afterward, two brutal murders take place -- and the evidence leads Martin to conclude that the culprits were his beloved wax figures. Though credited to Charles Beaumont, "The New Exhibit" was actually scripted by longtime Beaumont collaborator Jerry Sohl(n)</desc>

The three surviving astronauts -- Donlin (Edward Binns), Corey (Dewey Martin), and Pierson (Ted Otis) -- begin a long and arduous search for food and water. Unfortunately, Corey gets greedy, and he ultimately murders his two comrades. Only at the very end does Corey realize that his homicidal behavior was totally unecessary. First telecast January 15, 1960, "I Shot an Arrow into the Air" was scripted by Rod Serling from a story idea by Madelon Champion(n)</desc>

With the arrogance of inexperience, Katell demands that Sgt. Causarano (Albert Salmi) lead an attack against a group of wounded and dispirited Japanese soldiers -- "They are the enemy! First day of the war or the last day of the war!" But a sudden wrinkle in time causes Lt. Katell -- or should we say "Lt. Yamuri" -- to experience an epiphany. Future Star Trek stalwart Leonard Nimoy plays a small role as a radio operator. Scripted by Rod Serling from an idea by Sam Rolfe (Have Gun, Will Travel, Man from U.N.C.L.E. et al.), "A Quality of Mercy" was Twilight Zone's Yuletide offering for the 1961-62 season, making its first appearance on December 29, 1961(n)</desc>
