    <title lang="en">Who Wants to Be a Millionaire</title>
    <desc lang="en">Although the once-hot game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? had lost its luster as a prime-time ABC offering, the producers felt that there was enough life left in the property to warrant a Monday-through-Friday syndicated version. Taking over from the earlier series' host Regis Philbin was Meredith Vieira of The View. To make certain that the series would not be bankrupted after its first week on the air, the questions posed to contestants were considerably harder than those on the prime-time incarnation. Also, the famous "fastest finger" round was eliminated, taking some of the pressure off the contestants when they struggled to come up with answers. The most noteworthy change from the original version was the absence of Regis Philbin's familiar catchphrases: One would never hear Meredith Vieira chime in with the legendary "Is that your final answer?" The syndicated Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? was launched on September 16, 2002(n)</desc>

Ultimately, the mother and daughter are able to relocate to an apartment, which, despite its excessively dilapidated interior, seems to be an adequate location for beginning a new life. Before long, however, what appears to be the spirit of a young girl begins to haunt them. No stranger to mental illness, the wary young woman brushes the visions aside as part of the inherent stress of making the transition from housewife to working, single mom. As time goes by and the apparent haunting does not subside, the apartment's new residents are forced to examine the history of its former tenants. Dark Water also features performances from John C. Reilly, Tim Roth, and Dougray Scott(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Margot Fonteyn inspired generations of ballerinas, while her late-flowering partnership with Rudolf Nureyev created the most dazzling ballet partnership in history. However, her life was marked by tragedy and disappointment. Darcey finds that Margot couldn't find love and never had children, got drawn into a failed foreign revolution, danced on for too long, and died in poverty. The former ballerina goes behind the scenes at the Royal Opera House and the Royal Ballet, and travels from London to New York and Panama, discovering that Margot did eventually find a kind of happiness - though one that came at a high price.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Wildlife cameraman Gordon Buchanan visits the community of Churchill, Manitoba, on the shores of Canada's Hudson Bay. For two months every year, the people of Churchill must share their town with huge packs of polar bears, which gather at the bay every autumn to wait for the sea ice to form, so they can begin their winter hunt. Gordon goes on patrol with the `bear cops' charged with ensuring the towns residents - and the bears themselves - stay safe, and meets the bin-men who must dodge bears every day as they deliver refuse to the dump. He also illustrates the dangers of living in the `polar bear capital of the world' as he interviews a young woman who was mauled by a bear, right in the middle of Churchill's main street.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Ellie Harrison visits Thirsk in North Yorkshire to celebrate the centenary of James Herriot's birth, arguably the world's most famous vet. Known as Alf Wight to his family and friends, his semi-autobiographical accounts of his work - which began with the publication of All Creatures Great and Small in 1972 - won him an international fanbase, and inspired many youngsters in the 1970s and 1980s to become vets themselves. Here, Ellie meets Wight's son and daughter, and the vets that run his practice today. She also meets Christopher Timothy, the actor who played the part of Herriot in the BBC's adaptation of All Creatures Great and Small, and revisits classic moments from the Countryfile archive that highlight the work of people who have dedicated their time to helping animals.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Adele Story</title>
    <desc lang="en">Documentary charting the remarkable career trajectory of Adele Adkins, the pop and soul singer who rose from humble beginning in Tottenham to become one of the biggest stars of the modern music industry. Now popular enough to warrant going by her forename only, Adele's interest in music was encouraged by her mother from an early age. Winning a place at the Brit School in Croydon, Adele first shot into the public eye when her friend uploaded a demo to MySpace in 2006, and by the time she graduated, the singer had already secured a record deal. What followed were three hugely successful albums, 19, 21 and 25, each of which surpassed the last in terms of critical acclaim and sales figures. Adele also scored an Oscar in 2013 for her song Skyfall, which featured as the theme of the James Bond film of the same name.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Inspired by The Canterbury Tales, as well as the story of Ulrich von Lichtenstein, this is the story of William, a young squire with a gift for jousting. After his master dies suddenly, the squire hits the road with his cohorts Roland and Wat. On the journey, they stumble across an unknown writer, Chaucer. William, lacking a proper pedigree, convinces Chaucer to forge genealogy documents that will pass him off as a knight. With his newly-minted history in hand, the young man sets out to prove himself a worthy knight at the country's jousting competition, and finds romance along the way(n)</desc>

Jim White (Costner) finds his days as a football coach numbered when an incident with a player leads to his dismissal. Desperate for work, he moves his wife (Maria Bello) and daughters (Morgan Saylor and Elsie Fisher) from Idaho to McFarland, CA, a rural town that's predominately Latino and the only place willing to give him a teaching job. The family feel like they don't fit into their new community, but White has an epiphany one day when he sees his students running from their early-morning farming jobs to school: Why not channel their talents into running cross-country track? Soon enough, White is connecting with his young charges, particularly a gifted athlete named Thomas (Carlos Pratts), and the squad set their sights on a state championship(n)</desc>

Jim White (Costner) finds his days as a football coach numbered when an incident with a player leads to his dismissal. Desperate for work, he moves his wife (Maria Bello) and daughters (Morgan Saylor and Elsie Fisher) from Idaho to McFarland, CA, a rural town that's predominately Latino and the only place willing to give him a teaching job. The family feel like they don't fit into their new community, but White has an epiphany one day when he sees his students running from their early-morning farming jobs to school: Why not channel their talents into running cross-country track? Soon enough, White is connecting with his young charges, particularly a gifted athlete named Thomas (Carlos Pratts), and the squad set their sights on a state championship(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Hang 'em High</title>
    <desc lang="en">Ex-lawman turned rancher Jed Cooper (Clint Eastwood) is moving a small herd of cattle when a group of nine men on horseback, led by Captain Wilson (Ed Begley Sr.), ride up and accuse him of having stolen the cattle and killed their owner. Refusing to believe his account, they string him up by the neck and leave him for dead, but they don't do the job right. Cooper is dangling there, barely alive, a few minutes later when Deputy U.S. Marshal Bliss (Ben Johnson) spots him and cuts him down. He survives the next few days in Bliss' tumbleweed wagon with the other prisoners, and is later cleared of any wrongdoing and released by Judge Fenton (Pat Hingle), just in time to witness the hanging of the man who really murdered the owner of the cattle and took Cooper's money. Cooper still wants revenge on the nine men who tried to hang him, but Fenton insists that he leave the bringing of them to justice to his deputy marshals. As it happens, Fenton is in desperate need of deputy marshals for the territory that he oversees, and he also knows that Cooper was a good lawman. Cooper, in turn, is now broke and in need of a job, and does want to see justice done. They strike an uneasy bargain, Cooper agreeing to wear a badge and bring in the men he's looking for -- alive -- for trial. The latter proves easier said than done, however, when the first of them that he spots tries to draw on him when he makes the arrest. One of the hanging party, Jenkins (Bob Steele), soon turns himself in and provides the names of the others. Cooper takes Stone (Alan Hale Jr.) alive, but the hapless blacksmith is later shot by the local sheriff (Charles McGraw) while trying to escape. The other men, led by Wilson, have no intention of dying, or even being brought to trial, without a fight. Two of them go on the run out of the territory, while Wilson and two of the others decide to take the law into their own hands once again. Meanwhile, Cooper becomes a hero when he single-handedly brings back a trio of rustlers who are also guilty of murder. This leads to Cooper's first confrontation with Judge Fenton, who, in a gripping scene, explains why it is essential that he be as seemingly quick to hang a man as he is. Unless the people are convinced that the law will do its job -- including hanging men who deserve it -- they will keep taking the law into their own hands and there will be more lynch mobs like the one that tried to kill Cooper. In the course of his quest for justice, Cooper also makes the acquaintance of Rachel (Inger Stevens), a young woman with her own search for justice, haunted by her own ghosts, and the two of them are drawn together, no more so than when Wilson and two of the others try to gun Cooper down in cold blood. The final confrontation between Cooper and Wilson escalates in violence to its savage, irony-laced conclusion(n)</desc>

Peter Quill was just a young boy when, devastated by his mother's death, he sprinted out of the hospital and was swept into the stars by Yondu (Michael Rooker), the leader of an eclectic band of space scavengers known as The Ravagers. Twenty-six years later, Quill has adopted the nickname Star Lord (Chris Pratt). He's broken away from The Ravagers in an attempt to track down an ancient orb that is also coveted by the evil Ronan (Lee Pace), who is in league with the dreaded Thanos, and who dispatches his top assassin Gamora (Zoe Saldana) to retrieve it from Star Lord. In the process of doing so, Gamora also gets drawn into a fight with furry bounty hunter Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper) and his tree-like, humanoid companion Groot (voice of Vin Diesel). Subsequently thrown into prison, this unlikely quartet quickly makes the acquaintance of fearsome warrior Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista), who seeks bitter revenge for the slaughter of his entire family at the hands of Ronan. In the process of making a daring prison break, Star Lord, Gamora, Rocket, Groot, and Drax recover the orb, and transport it to The Collector (Benecio Del Toro), who reveals that it houses an Infinity Gem - one of six precious stones that harbors incredible powers that could pose a dire threat should they fall into the wrong hands.

It's "Nuclear Plant Employees, Spouses, and No More Than Three Children Night" at Springfield Stadium, as Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta), his family, and his many co-workers assemble to watch the Springfield Isotopes, the town's minor-league baseball team, play ball. Homer finds himself seated next to his boss, Mr. Burns (voice of Harry Shearer), but to Homer's surprise, Mr. Burns is in an expansive mood and buys him beer after beer as they enjoy the game. In the eighth inning, Springfield is down by three points, and Homer, more than a bit drunk, begins dancing wildly to inspire the fans to cheer on the local boys. It actually works, and the team's owner asks Homer to come back and perform at the Isotopes next game. Soon "Dancing Homer" is the team's official mascot and a minor celebrity in Springfield, with his wife Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) especially surprised to see a Simpson on a T-Shirt. Homer's antics attract the attention of the management of the Capital City Capitals, and Homer gets a once-in-a-lifetime offer -- a chance to be a mascot in the Major Leagues. Tony Bennett makes a vocal cameo singing an upbeat big band-style number about the joys of life in Capital City. "Dancing Homer" was first aired on November 8, 1990(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Bart Gets an F. While Bart Simpson (voice of Nancy Cartwright) has never been a star student, his grades have been slipping even further than usual, and his teacher Mrs. Krabappel (voice of Marcia Wallace) warns him that if his marks don't improve, he might fail history and be left back rather than graduate to the fifth grade. Bart intends to study before his big test, but Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) persuades him to watch some television with him first; by the time Bart finally cracks his books, he's nearly fallen asleep. The next morning, Bart is convinced he can't pass and fakes being sick; Bart gets answers for the test from Milhouse (voice of Cartwright), but Milhouse turns out to be a bad choice, and Bart gets an F. Desperate to pass his class, Bart makes a deal with class brain Martin (voice of Russi Taylor) -- if Martin shows Bart how to be smart, Bart will show Martin how to be cool. Martin, however, turns into a party animal and fails to live up to his end of the bargain, and Bart prays to God for a reprieve on his test. To Bart's astonishment, a freak snowstorm causes school to be cancelled the next day, and while all his friends are out having fun, Bart studies like he's never studied before in a last-ditch attempt to pass the fourth grade. "Bart Gets an F" was first aired on October 11, 1990(n)</desc>

Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) puts his natural boisterousness to good use as the town crier in the town's historical pageant, and Lisa (voice of Yeardley Smith) has decided to write an essay for school on the town's founder, Jebediah Springfield. However, while doing research at the Springfield Historical Society Museum, Lisa discovers a document which proves Jebediah Springfield was actually a bloodthirsty pirate with an artificial tongue named Hans Sprungfeld. However, city officials do not eagerly embrace this news, and Hollis Hurlbut (voice of Donald Sutherland), president of the Historical Society, declares that Lisa is a fraud. Homer, however, believes that his daughter speaks the truth, and uses his new credibility as Town Crier to give her a chance to prove her story is true.

    <desc lang="en">The Way We Was. After their TV goes on the blink, the Simpson family is faced with the grim prospect of having to actually talk to each other, and Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) decides to make the best of it by telling Lisa (voice of Yeardley Smith) and Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright) the story of how she and Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) fell in love. It's 1974, and Homer Simpson is a skinny guy with a full head of hair who has no idea of what he wants to do with his future. Marge Bouvier has ended up in detention for the first time after burning a bra on school property in the midst of a brief infatuation with the women's movement. There she meets Homer, who has been kept after school yet again for smoking on school grounds. For Homer, it's love at first sight, and he's determined to find some way to get Marge's attention; pretending to be studying French, Homer gets Marge to tutor him, then asks her to the big dance. Marge says yes, but she's furious when she learns Homer isn't really taking French and that he kept her up late the night before a major forensics tournament. Marge decides instead to accept an invitation from debate club president Arnie Ziff (voice of Jon Lovitz) to go to the prom. Homer, however, never hears about this, figuring that if she never formally broke off their date, she'll still go with him, no matter how angry she is, and he finds himself going to the prom stag and watching Marge enjoy her big night with Artie.

Bart Simpson (voice of Nancy Cartwright) has grown tired of listening to his sister Lisa (voice of Yeardley Smith) practice her saxophone, but she doesn't feel like stopping for the day; a fight breaks out between them, and the sax flies out the window, where it's soon crushed by a truck. Lisa becomes despondent, and Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) and Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) share the story of how she picked up the instrument in the first place. Years ago, Bart was starting kindergarten and was having trouble fitting in with the other kids; they took him to see child psychologist Dr. J. Loren Pryor (voice of Harry Shearer), and Pryor quickly realizes that Lisa is a gifted child. Pryor suggests Marge and Homer send Lisa to a pre-school for children of above-average intelligence, but they discover there's no way they can afford it. Someone suggests they could encourage Lisa's creativity by getting her a musical instrument, but Homer isn't eager to spend the money he'd earmarked for an air conditioner on his daughter. Meanwhile, Bart makes an important discovery that sends him on a long path of proving bad attention is better than no attention at all. "Lisa's Sax" was first aired on October 19, 1997, and featured a brief voice cameo from Fyvush Finkel, who is shown playing Krusty The Clown in a made-for-TV movie(n)</desc>

Lately, Burns has been pining for the teddy bear he had as a child, Bobo, and he won't be happy until he can recover the toy. Smithers is put on the project, but the bear soon turns up in a very unlikely place -- in a bag of ice purchased by Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castallaneta). Homer gives the teddy bear to his baby daughter, Maggie, and when Homer learns that there's a very valuable old teddy bear in his home, he discovers that Maggie doesn't want to give up her new teddy. Burns offers Homer a large sum of money for the bear, but Homer is forced to turn it down when Maggie refuses to give up the bear; angry, Burns then tries to force Homer to give up the bear by cutting off his supplies of beer and television, and eventually Burns and Smithers plan an elaborate plot to steal the bear.

    <title lang="en">The Greatest Game Ever Played</title>
    <desc lang="en">The true story of an upset victory that helped change the sport of golf forever provides the basis for this period drama. Francis Ouimet (played by Shia LaBeouf) was born in 1893 to a working-class family in Massachusetts, and grew up fascinated by golf. However, at that time golf was considered a pastime of the wealthy and privileged, and British and Scottish players dominated the professional game. Ouimet's familial home was near the Brookline, MA, Country Club, and over the stern objections of his father, Francis got a job there as a caddy. Honing his skill in his spare time, Francis displayed a tremendous natural talent for the game and an understanding of its strategies, and 1913 he became the first amateur to play in the U.S. Open, held at the Brookline Country Club. Ouimet's presence was considered little more than a novelty at the time; Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane), a British champion with six tournament victories under his belt, was considered a shoo-in to win, with Ted Ray (Stephen Marcus) his only serious competition. However, Vardon, a fellow working-class boy who had overcome tuberculosis to become Britain's premier professional golfer, had more in common with Ouimet than anyone expected, and the tournament unexpectedly became a hard-fought competition between an established star and a promising unknown. Directed by Bill Paxton in his second directorial effort, The Greatest Game Ever Played also stars Elias Koteas as Francis' father, Josh Flitter as the ten-year-old boy who becomes Francis' caddy, and Peyton List as Sarah Wallis, Francis' sweetheart(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman star as two terminally ill cancer patients who decide to break out of the hospital and live their last days to the fullest in director Rob Reiner's seriocomic road movie. Edward Cole (Nicholson) is a corporate billionaire who is currently sharing a hospital room with blue-collar mechanic Carter Chambers (Freeman). Though initially the pair seems to have nothing in common, conversation gradually reveals that both men have a long list of goals they wish to accomplish before they kick the bucket, and an unrealized desire to discover what kind of men they really are. But one can't accomplish such lofty objectives from the confines of a hospital bed, so now, in order to live their lives to the absolute fullest, Edward and Carter will have to make a break for it. With a checklist that includes playing the poker tables in Monte Carlo, consuming copious amounts of caviar, racing the fastest machines on four wheels, and much more, these two terminally ill men will do their best to fit a lifetime of experience into their last remaining days while forging an unlikely, but truly remarkable, friendship(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Disney's The Kid</title>
    <desc lang="en">If you could talk to the child that you used to be, what advice would you give him? That question forms the basis of this comic fantasy. Forty-year-old Russ Duritz (Bruce Willis) is a wealthy and powerful "image consultant" who has made a career out of telling people how to present themselves. But while he's a success in business, he's a failure in life; he's vain, mean-spirited, and hasn't been able to hold onto a marriage (or even a pet dog). One day, Russ is startled to meet Rusty (Spencer Breslin), a stocky kid whom he soon realizes is himself at the age of eight, having passed through a wrinkle in time. Young Rusty doesn't seem much happier than the grown-up Russ, so the older man takes his younger self under his wing and tries to teach him how to avoid the mistakes he's made, while Rusty encourages Russ to be a more caring human being. Along the way, Russ and Rusty become friends, and realize how much they can learn from each other. Disney's The Kid also stars Jean Smart as one of Russ' clients, Lily Tomlin as his assistant, and Daniel Von Bargen as his father(n)</desc>

Unlike her father, Maya hasn't found a suitable use for her talents, and as she finds an outlet for her unique language skills, she is sent away to Durango, a combination summer camp and dude ranch, where she strikes up a rapport with both the fellow campers and the livestock. When she learns that Durango is on the verge of going out of business due to money problems, Maya starts working with the camp's horses and cattle, giving them a much needed pep talk as they're entered in a local rodeo that could save Durango.

Stokes (Billy Bob Thornton) is a con man and a thief who teams up with his friend Marcus (Tony Cox), a midget, for a very special scam each year during the holiday season. Willie gets a job as Santa Claus at a shopping mall, his pal tags along as an elf, and they use their employee status to crack mall security and rob stores blind just before Christmas. However, there's one flaw to this plan -- Willie is a bitter, foul-mouthed and perpetually grouchy alcoholic who doesn't care for kids, and it's all he can do to keep himself from getting fired while on the job. The mall's manager (John Ritter, in his last film appearance) is certain something's wrong with the Santa he's hired, so he asks the mall's chief of security (Bernie Mac) to do some research on Willie. Meanwhile, one of the kids Willie is forced to talk to becomes a regular customer; overweight, awkward, and the frequent target of bullies, the boy manages to arouse something like sympathy from Willie, who tries to give him some advice and develops something vaguely resembling Christmas sprit along the way. Bad Santa was directed by Terry Zwigoff, who enjoyed previous success with Crumb and Ghost World(n)</desc>

When Roy finds himself in desperate need of more pills, he is forced to see legitimate psychotherapist Dr. Klein (Bruce Altman). Roy ends up talking about his emotional damage from a troubled marriage and divorce, which results in the discovery of a child whom he has never met. Dr. Klein suggests that he spend a weekend with the kid, so in walks teenaged Angela (played by twentysomething Alison Lohman). Reluctant to develop his role as a father, Roy also gets heavily involved in Frank's ambitious swindle(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">An Ache in Every Stake. The Three Stooges play ice delivery men in this comic short. It's a hot day, and they've been cooling off in the back of the truck; in fact, Curly has gotten his head stuck inside a block of ice. After the other two Stooges free him, he bowls a strike with another block of ice and some milk bottles. Finally he is put into service carrying some ice up a long, long flight of stairs (no, they're not the same stairs used in Laurel and Hardy's short, The Music Box, but they seem to be located in the same area of Los Angeles -- the Silverlake district). By the time Curly reaches the top, the ice block has melted into an ice cube. As a solution the boys bring the ice box down the stairs and load it up at the bottom -- a good idea except that near the top the filled cabinet goes barreling down the steps and smashes into a man (Vernon Dent) holding a cake. Up at the house, the Stooges annoy the cook into quitting, and the dismayed matron has no one to fix dinner for her husband's birthday party. The well-meaning Stooges volunteer their services, with the predictably disastrous results. The finale is a fresh cake, which the boys have pumped full of gas because it fell. With a huge blast it explodes, sending the Stooges back down the long, long flight of stairs(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A-Plumbing We Will Go. One of The Three Stooges best Columbia shorts, this picture begins with the boys in a typical situation -- they're down and out and on trial for stealing chickens. They manage to get off, but find themselves in trouble once again when they go fishing...in a pet store's fish tank. They escape from a cop with the use of a magician's disappearing act and drive off in a plumber's truck. The estate the trio land on has a leaky pipe, so the Stooges do their best to fix it -- which means they just about destroy the whole house. One of the best gags shows Curly Howard in the bathroom, screwing pipe onto pipe onto pipe until he's caged in -- the answer to his dilemma, of course, is to drill through the floor. Later, the lady of the house shows off her new "television receiver" to some guests (quite a novelty in 1940!). A live shot of Niagara Falls turns into a real-life Niagara as a gush of water smashes through the screen. Not surprisingly, a chase results from the mayhem. Th! e magician from earlier in the short is part of the afternoon's entertainment, and the Stooges emerge from his disappearing box -- as do a number of cops and a couple of police motorcycles(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Boobs in Arms. World War II was just heating up, but the U.S. hadn't yet entered the fighting when the Three Stooges made this comic short. It opens with the boys selling greeting cards on the street, none too successfully. One surly guy in particular is a victim of the Stooges' harassment. To get away from his wrath, the boys dash into an apartment building, where they find a weepy young woman who thinks her husband doesn't love her anymore. To help her out, the Stooges offer to try to make her husband jealous. The woman's spouse turns out to be the very same man they harassed a few minutes earlier. To get away from him -- again -- the guys get in what they think is a bread line, but it's really a recruitment line for the Army. In a flash the Stooges are in uniform -- only to discover that their sergeant is the very same angry husband. They manage to make it through basic training and are sleeping through bomb blasts when they're woken up and sent on a mission. The sergeant has been captured and they're supposed to bomb enemy headquarters with laughing gas. Naturally, the gas shell explodes on them and they're captured. At the enemy headquarters, they manage to knock everyone unconscious while laughing uncontrollably. The place is being shelled by the American troops, and the Stooges, still laughing, ride one of the shells as it soars out of the building(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">From Nurse to Worse. Written by former Buster Keaton gag man (Clyde Bruckman, this typical Three Stooges 2-reeler centered on Curly (Curly Howard, who is forced to act insane in order to collect on an insurance -- not too difficult a task for the infantile Stooge. Pretending to be a dog, Curly is delivered to the insurance doctor on a leash, but the good doc insists on performing a cerebrum decapitation on his patient and the Stooges flee on a runaway gurney. One of the busiest starlets in the Stooges stock company, Dorothy Appleby, headed the supporting cast which also included black comic Dudley Dickerson, former boxer Cy Schindell, the formidable-looking Blanche Payson and sour-faced Ned Glass (in his second of two early Stooges appearances). The latter became one of the victims of the insidious Hollywood "red scare" blacklist, but his friendship with Moe Howard led to work in such Stooge comedies as Hokus Pokus (1949) and Three Hams on Rye (1954)(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">A Gem of a Jam</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">A Gem of a Jam. This clever Three Stooges comedy opens, like many of their films do, with a sign: "Drs. Heart-Burns and Belcher." But that's not referring to the Stooges -- they're merely the night janitors, and not very good ones. They have the usual round of mishaps, the funniest being when Curly gets his head stuck in a fish bowl. Even after Larry and Moe free him from the globe, he's not quite right, so they stick him behind the fluoroscope and discover he has swallowed a fish. They retrieve it by sticking a fishing line -- with bait -- down his throat. Their work is further interrupted by a trio of crooks. While escaping the police, one of them was shot in the shoulder, and they insist that the Stooges -- who they have mistaken for doctors -remove the slug. The wounded crook insists on being anesthetized, which confuses the trio until they're told, "That means he wants to be knocked out!" "Ohhh---" they reply knowingly, and they knock him cold with a hammer. But the wounded crook slides off the gurney, out the window and into a waiting police car. To fool the other two gun men (who apparently aren't much smarter than the Stooges), Moe and Larry stick Curly under the sheet. The police finally show up looking for the crooks and both the gunmen and Stooges go running. While the crooks are nabbed, the Stooges wind up in a strange storage area with a bunch of mannequins, a gigantic, spooky jack-in-the-box, a frightened night watchman and a vat of plaster. Curly falls into the plaster and his ghostly white visage scares everyone he encounters until the short comes to a rather abrupt end(n)</desc>

But when they discover that the establishment is run by an old widow who is about to lose her lease, they instead attack the landlord. Despite their usual detructive antics, the Stooges manage to turn the run-down place into a swank night spot, saving the widow from ruin. Screenwriter Clyde Bruckman made the mistake of lifting an entire sequence (Curly performing a magic act) from Harold Lloyd's earlier Movie Madness (1932). Lloyd sued, seeking $500,000 in damages, and won. The court case, and a rather public bout with alcoholism, damaged Bruckman's career almost beyond repair and, dejected and out of work, he committed suicide in 1955(n)</desc>

They've been sleeping in the awning of a swap shop and are rudely awakened when the shop owner unrolls it. After turning the store into a disaster area, the trio run away. They escape to city hall and exit as census takers. Excited over their four-cents-per-head fee, they get working. One place they invade is a mansion during a party. Curly, who has been flirting with the maid in the kitchen, mixes the punch and sweetens it with alum, which he mistakes for powdered sugar. Meanwhile, Moe and Larry somehow get collared by the hostess into playing bridge. When the card players drink the alum-saturated punch, their mouths shrivel up, which makes bidding very difficult. Curly and the maid get into a spat and the hostess, who is in the wrong place at the wrong time, winds up with a dress soaked with punch. The Stooges dash off and find a stadium full of spectators watching a football game. The potential income from all these surveys is very appealing, so the boys sneak into the stadium and start off by trying to survey the players. This doesn't go over very well with the team, and after the Stooges have disrupted the game, the players chase them out of the stadium and into the street(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Capital of Baseball. New York held sway in the world of baseball from 1950-1960, and the seventh episode -- or "inning" -- of Ken Burns' documentary series focuses on the dominating forces of the Yankees, Dodgers, and Giants. At least one of these teams played in every World Series between 1949 and 1958, and six of those series saw the Yankees pitted against either the Dodgers or the Giants. Yogi Berra and Mickey Mantle of the Yankees, Jackie Robinson and Roy Campanella of the Dodgers, as well as Willie Mays and Bobby Thompson of the Giants are just some of the legendary players who lit up the newsreel clips and increasingly popular TV screens. It was a decade of moving franchises, as the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles, the Giants to San Francisco, and the Braves to Milwaukee. But in the seventh inning, the game is far from over(n)</desc>

Ken Burns' Baseball: Inning 9 -- Home, the final episode, deals with such threats to our national pastime as drug use by players, the egos of players and owners such as Reggie Jackson and George Steinbrenner, sky-rocketing salaries, and Pete Rose's banishment for gambling. But it also relives such moments as Hank Aaron breaking Babe Ruth's home run record, Carlton Fisk keeping the ball fair at Fenway with his body language, and Ken Griffey Sr. and Ken Griffey Jr. hitting back-to-back home runs in a game. Jackie Robinson's funeral is also covered in this episode, as Burns continues to pay tribute to the man who broke baseball's color barrier(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Babe</title>
    <desc lang="en">John Goodman is cast as the Sultan of Swat, whose excesses -- especially drinking -- and private demons can (in this context) be excused in view of his genuine love of baseball. The facts never get in the way of a good story for screenwriter John Fusco; we're even offered the umpteenth rehash of "Little Johnny", the largely fanciful tale of the invalid boy who promises to get well if Babe hits him a homer (as in Pride of the Yankees, the cured Johnny makes return a appearance as grownup). The most amusing fabrication is the casting of narrow James Cromwell as the Babe's orphanage mentor Brother Mathias, who in real life weighed 300 pounds. Many of the characters are composites, notably Bruce Boxleitner's Jumpin' Joe Dugan. At least Ruth's two wives--Trini Alvarado as Helen, who suffers Babe's many peccadilloes and dies under strange circumstances, and Kelly McGillis as Claire, who keeps Babe on a very short leash-are depicted with a modicum of accuracy. The baseball sequences are well handled (though there could have been less slo-mo) while Elmer Bernstein's charmingly old-fashioned musical score is right in tune with the film's approach to its subject. The Babe is rated PG; had this been the whole truth and nothing but, and R rating would probably have been in order(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Shop 'til You Drop. Nonstop glamour and excess find a new poster girl in the 1980s when a hot young singer sees her chance to create her own brand. Catapulted to superstardom with a shocking performance of Like a Virgin at the first MTV Music Video Awards, Madonna inspires countless girls across the globe to hit the nearest shopping mall to match her distinctive style. But, it's not just teen girls who are putting their credit cards to work; successful young men with money to burn are buying into the young professional - or yuppie - lifestyle, and scooping up the latest expensive gadget: the cell phone. For USD $4,000, U.S. consumers can pick up their own portable phone, weighing over one kilogram. But people also find important causes to rally behind in the 1980s: in October 1983, nearly three million people take to the streets to create the biggest peace demonstration of the 20th century in protest against the proposed installation of American nuclear missiles in Western Europe(n)</desc>

For the first time, huge, star-studded events are staged to deal with the crisis of poverty around the world. And, in the UK, the AIDS campaign gets some very high profile support from Princess Diana. Through her work with AIDS patients, she raises awareness about the disease, and helps clear up important misconceptions. On the political front, as U.S. and Soviet Union Presidents Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev take steps to end the Cold War between two great superpowers, a 19-year-old from West Germany risks his life to spread his own message of peace between West and East. Mathias Rust manages to slip through the largest air defence system in the world and lands a small plane in Moscow's Red Square. Sentenced to four years in prison, he is released after 14 months(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Something nefarious is afloat in the depths of Bikini Bottom: King Neptune's crown has been stolen, and the prime suspect is Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob's boss at Mr. Krabs' Krabby Patties. Despite the overwhelming evidence against Mr. Krabs -- not to mention having been turned down for a long-awaited promotion at the restaurant -- SpongeBob (voice of Tom Kenny) refuses to believe that his boss is responsible and teams up with his best friend, Patrick (voice of Bill Fagerbakke), on a mission to Shell City, where he hopes he can exonerate Mr. Krabs and return the crown to its rightful owner. Of course, this is no easy task; once outside the safety of Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob is faced with the overwhelming dangers of the sea, not the least of which being a cyclops that many believe to be responsible for the deaths of countless other unfortunate sea-creatures who ventured outside county lines. Among those who lent their vocal chords to the film include Scarlett Johansson, Jeffrey Tambor, and Alec Baldwin(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">First to Fly.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The veteran naturalist examines the world of flight, travelling across the globe to chart the evolutionary story of those creatures who seemingly defy the rules of gravity by taking to the air. Initially focusing on insects, Attenborough meets a descendant of the dragonfly, before examining the Atlas beetle, which tends to restrict flight to times when it needs a mate or a fresh supply of food. More aesthetically pleasing is a group of beautiful tropical butterflies, followed by an in-depth study into the blow fly - the jet fighter of insects.(n)</desc>

However, the harvestman spider has no use for sex at all, and reproduces by cloning itself.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The broadcaster explores the Galapagos, a collection of volcanic islands in the Pacific known for its extraordinary wildlife. More than 150 years after Charles Darwin formulated his ground-breaking theory of evolution on the remote archipelago, Attenborough explains how life on the islands has continued to evolve in biological isolation, examining how the ever-changing volcanic landscape has given birth to species and sub-species that exist nowhere else in the world. He begins by revealing how Galapagos rose from the ocean four million years ago.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Cold Souls</title>
    <desc lang="en">Writer/director Sophie Barthes crafts this metaphysical tragicomedy, which straddles the line between reality and fantasy, set in a world where souls are extracted from humans and traded as commodites. Paul Giamatti is an anxious New Yorker who finds the answer to his deep-rooted malaise after stumbling upon an article about a high-tech company that claims to have found a solution to human suffering. By deep-freezing souls, claims the company, they can give their customers a life free from fear, doubt, and worry. Eager to free himself from the emotional burden of angst, Giamatti eagerly enlists their services. Trouble arises, however, when Giamatti's soul is swiped by a soul-trafficking "mule" who in turn gives it to a no-talent Russian soap opera actress. Now, in order to get back the soul that is rightfully his, Giamatti must make the arduous trip to St. Petersburg, along the way discovering that the true key to happiness isn't the absence of pain, but the ability to experience the entire spectrum of emotion and cherish the things that really matter(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Writer/director Sophie Barthes crafts this metaphysical tragicomedy, which straddles the line between reality and fantasy, set in a world where souls are extracted from humans and traded as commodites. Paul Giamatti is an anxious New Yorker who finds the answer to his deep-rooted malaise after stumbling upon an article about a high-tech company that claims to have found a solution to human suffering. By deep-freezing souls, claims the company, they can give their customers a life free from fear, doubt, and worry. Eager to free himself from the emotional burden of angst, Giamatti eagerly enlists their services. Trouble arises, however, when Giamatti's soul is swiped by a soul-trafficking "mule" who in turn gives it to a no-talent Russian soap opera actress. Now, in order to get back the soul that is rightfully his, Giamatti must make the arduous trip to St. Petersburg, along the way discovering that the true key to happiness isn't the absence of pain, but the ability to experience the entire spectrum of emotion and cherish the things that really matter(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Kirk (William Shatner), McCoy (DeForest Kelley), and Spock (Leonard Nimoy) are enjoying a vacation in Yosemite National Park when duty calls. Vulcan cult leader Sybok (Laurence Luckinbill) and his followers have invaded a "planet of peace," where delegates from hostile races coexist in a sort of intergalactic United Nations. Ordered to quell the crisis, the Enterprise crew discovers that it's a ruse perpetrated by Sybok, who takes over the ship, piloting it toward the "Great Barrier," an energy field at the galaxy's rim. Sybok, who is revealed to be Spock's half-brother, possesses the ability to help people face their "inner pain." He also believes that God lies beyond the Great Barrier. Once arriving there, however, Sybok and the Enterprise crew discover only an imprisoned alien entity. Shatner wrote the story and made his directorial debut with the film, failing to ape the success that his colleague Nimoy enjoyed with his pair of Trek directing forays(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Shawshank Redemption</title>
    <desc lang="en">Based on a story by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption is the directorial debut of screenwriter Frank Darabont. In 1946, a banker named Andy Dufresne is convicted of a double murder, even though he stubbornly proclaims his innocence. He's sentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine, where another lifer, Ellis "Red" Redding, picks him as the new recruit most likely to crack under the pressure. The ugly realities of prison life are quickly introduced to Andy: a corrupt warden,sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley, and inmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or beatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the hope of the truly innocent, which allow him to prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with the warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal business schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the prison staff. In exchange, he is able to improve the prison library and bring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates, including Red. Starring Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins, Bob Gunton(n)</desc>

Fred Flintstone (Mark Addy), a working-class caveman who earns his living at Mr. Slate's quarry, falls in love with wealthy heiress Wilma Slaghoople (Kristen Johnson). While many people think that Fred is out of his league, including Wilma's mother Pearl (Joan Collins) and her father Col. Slaghoople (Harvey Korman), he's determined to win her heart. And when his best friend Barney Rubble (Stephen Baldwin) decides to take his best girl Betty (Jane Krakowski) for a fun weekend in Rock Vegas, he invites Wilma to tag along. The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas recasts all the major roles from 1994's The Flintstones; Harvey Korman is the only actor to appear in both films, though in different roles (in the previous movie, he was the voice of the Dictabird)(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A scrawny rat named Remy (voice of Patton Oswalt) finds his dreams of culinary superstardom stirring up sizable controversy in the kitchen of a fine French restaurant in director Brad Bird's madcap computer-animated comedy. It's hard being a rat with culinary aspirations, but Remy is convinced he has what it takes to break the stereotypes and follow in the footsteps of star chef Auguste Gusteau (voice of Brad Garrett). As fate would have it, Remy is currently situated in the sewers directly beneath Gusteau's elegant restaurant. Soon Remy teams up with a young chef with little talent named Linguini (voice of Lou Romano).

Fred Flintstone (Mark Addy), a working-class caveman who earns his living at Mr. Slate's quarry, falls in love with wealthy heiress Wilma Slaghoople (Kristen Johnson). While many people think that Fred is out of his league, including Wilma's mother Pearl (Joan Collins) and her father Col. Slaghoople (Harvey Korman), he's determined to win her heart. And when his best friend Barney Rubble (Stephen Baldwin) decides to take his best girl Betty (Jane Krakowski) for a fun weekend in Rock Vegas, he invites Wilma to tag along. The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas recasts all the major roles from 1994's The Flintstones; Harvey Korman is the only actor to appear in both films, though in different roles (in the previous movie, he was the voice of the Dictabird)(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A scrawny rat named Remy (voice of Patton Oswalt) finds his dreams of culinary superstardom stirring up sizable controversy in the kitchen of a fine French restaurant in director Brad Bird's madcap computer-animated comedy. It's hard being a rat with culinary aspirations, but Remy is convinced he has what it takes to break the stereotypes and follow in the footsteps of star chef Auguste Gusteau (voice of Brad Garrett). As fate would have it, Remy is currently situated in the sewers directly beneath Gusteau's elegant restaurant. Soon Remy teams up with a young chef with little talent named Linguini (voice of Lou Romano). Together they are able to create some fabulous dishes, but they live in fear that someone will discover their secret and object strenuously to a rat being in a kitchen. When Remy's passion for cooking turns the haughty world of French cuisine upside down, the rat who would be king of the kitchen learns important lessons about life, friends, and family while questioning whether he should pursue his culinary calling or simply go back underground and return to his life as a sewer rat(n)</desc>

She's incarcerated in a mental health institution for her insistent, passionately held belief that mankind is on the verge of extinction instigated by the soon-to-go-rogue Skynet automated US defence network. Meanwhile, her young son, John Connor, is living with his grandparents. Having failed at the first attempt to eradicate its future nemesis, Skynet sends another deadly envoy, a shape-shifting T-1000 Terminator, back in time to the present to murder John. But the future John Connor has counteracted the Skynet mission by reprogramming a T-800 Terminator to protect his young self. Unfortunately, Sarah's last encounter with the T-800 was a far from happy experience, so she's not going to react well to seeing it again; and she's blissfully unaware of the real threat to her son. Can she once again save John's life, and the future of humanity? Head-spinning time travel complications aside, Cameron and the cast deliver another much-praised, thoughtful and thrilling ride, which earned one of its four Oscars for its superb special effects(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">54</title>
    <desc lang="en">Mark Christopher wrote and directed this look back at the Disco Era when the popular Studio 54 was at its apogee in the late '70s. With obvious comparisons to Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights (1997) and Whit Stillman's The Last Days of Disco (1998), the story introduces working-class 19-year-old Irish-American Shane O'Shea (Ryan Phillippe), who has lived with his father and siblings since the death of his mother when he was 12. Shane quickly rises from busboy to bartender at Studio 54, co-owned and managed in a paternal manner by entrepreneur Steve Rubell (Mike Myers). Busboy Greg Randazzo (Breckin Meyer) and Greg's wife, Anita (Salma Hayek), the club's coat check girl, become Shane's new friends, and he encounters the possibility of romance with soap star Julie Black (Neve Campbell). The story spans the summer of 1979 until the decline of Studio 54 a year later with IRS investigations, followed by the arrest and jailing of Rubell. Costumes by Ellen Lutter capture the glitter and glam-glitz of the period(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">First Sunday</title>
    <desc lang="en">Gospel-minded playwright David E. Talbert produces, writes, and directs this urban crime comedy concerning a pair of criminals who take a group of church parishioners hostage while attempting to rob the holy house, only to find their captives slowly convincing them to repent and give up their lawless lifestyles. Durell (Ice Cube) and LeeJohn (Tracy Morgan) are two best friends with a special knack for petty crime. Upset at discovering that his ex-girlfriend is planning to move out of state with the couple's young son, Durell knows that the only way to keep his fractured family in close proximity to one another is to raise the 17,000 dollars needed to pay off her growing debt. In order to get the money before his ex decides to make the big move, the desperate Durell enlists the aid of his scheming best buddy to rob their neighborhood church. But someone has beaten Durell and LeeJohn to the punch, and if they ever hope to get their hands on that quick cash, this bumbling pair will first have to spend an entire night in the presence of not just the almighty lord, but some of his most fervent followers as well.

    <desc lang="en">Real-life sweethearts Michael Cera and Charlyne Yi star in a fictionalized version of their romance in this indie semi-documentary comedy, written by Yi. Playing themselves, Yi and Cera embark on a scripted version of their own story. In the movie, Yi has agreed to be the subject of a documentary about her quest to discover if love really exists, since she's never experienced it. As part of her participation in the project, she has a film crew follow her around throughout every new development in her love life -- which gets complicated when she starts dating fellow comedian Cera. This portion of the film is all narrative, and was written into the script, but also as part of the documentary, Yi travels the country interviewing various people about their opinions and experiences with love, and these portions of the film are real -- the interviewees are not actors. Melding truth and fantasy, Paper Heart uses equal parts comedy and realism to resolve the ultimate question of whether love is fact or fiction(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Smoke</title>
    <desc lang="en">This ensemble drama centers on a neighborhood cigar store as it chronicles the entangled lives of fifteen characters. The story is divided into five chapters each bearing the name of a different character. The main players have roles in all five stories. The first, "Paul" follows recently widowed novelist Paul Benjamin whose wife died during a bank robbery. He is almost hit by a truck when a black teenager who calls himself Rashid, saves him. The thankful novelist lets the teen stay with him for a while. Rashid's story forms the basis of chapter two. Paul is visited by Rashid's aunt who tells him that the boys true name is Thomas Cole. He has recently learned that his dad is really alive and living out of the city. Rashid journeys to meet his dad, Cyrus Cole. When he meets him, Rashid tells him his name is Paul Benjamin. Auggie, the cigar store manager, also gets a surprise when his ex-wife shows up to tell him his daughter is a pregnant drug addict. Rashid tells Paul that he has $6000, the spoils of a recent bank robbery perpetrated by his pal, Creeper. The rest of the chapters are equally convoluted(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Redbelt</title>
    <desc lang="en">Tim Allen and Chiwetel Ejiofor co-star in writer/director David Mamet's martial arts drama Redbelt. Ejiofor plays Mike Terry, a jujitsu master who co-runs a very modest martial arts studio in Los Angeles with his bossy wife, Sondra (Alice Braga). Mike demonstrates an unwavering commitment to his craft and draws a cadre of defiantly loyal pupils including Joe (Max Martini), an LAPD cop. All told, it appears that he has chosen a peaceful and conflict-free path in life. The dedicated martial artist's fate takes an unanticipated turn, however, one evening when a young woman named Laura (Emily Mortimer) bursts into the academy in a state of near hysteria, and reaches for a policeman's gun when he tries to restrain her. One thing leads to another, and before long, Laura is regularly receiving martial arts lessons from Mike. As master begins to teach pupil and his martial arts philosophies emerge, his path also crisscrosses with that of a Hollywood movie star, Chet Frank (Tim Allen), when he saves the fellow from a beating at a local club and gets invited (along with Sondra) to Chet's house for dinner. Chet extends gestures of friendship, and Mike's guard breaks down; he speaks openly and candidly of a special martial arts method he employs that requires one of the participants to "assume a handicap." In time, the association with Chet leads to involvement in the motion-picture industry, and relations with a bevy of characters who aren't exactly what they seem -- including a pay-per-view fight mogul (Ricky Jay) and Chet's slimy and manipulative manager (Joe Mantegna)(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Four directors, John Landis, Steven Spielberg, Joe Dante and George Miller, created their own versions of classic stories from the television series Twilight Zone. Landis crafted story of a bigoted man who can taste a tremendous game of his own hatred. Spielberg follows with a fable about pensioners as if by magic, the chance to become young again. Dante offers a horror experience, but its like when a child uses his series inspired super powers to enslave his entire family. In Miller's final fear knows no boundaries when a neurotic passenger sees a monster on jet wing. Or what is it he sees exactly?(n)</desc>

A surprise visit from her now-decrepit leading man Jerry Hearndon (Jerome Cowan) forces Barbara to face reality -- or does it? Bearing traces of Sunset Boulevard, but with a poignant Twilight Zone twist, "The Sixteen-Millimeter Shrine" was written by Rod Serling and directed by Mitchell Leisen (one of the last assignments for this veteran); the episode originally aired October 23, 1959(n)</desc>

Richard Conte stars as Edward Hall, a man who lives in mortal fear of falling asleep. Visiting a psychiatrst (John Larch), Hall explains that he has a weak heart, and that his recurring dream of a beautiful woman (Suzanne Lloyd) luring him to his doom will surely result in a fatal coronary. Alas, the psychiatrist's nurse is the spitting image of the woman in Hall's nightmares. Superbly directed by Robert Florey and boasting an eerie musical score by Nathan Van Cleave, "Perchance to Dream" is enough to give anyone nightmares(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">The Four of Us Are Dying</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The Four of Us Are Dying. Once seen in childhood, the January 1, 1960 Twilight Zone episode "The Four of Us Are Dying" can never be forgotten. Set in a surrealistic New York City (replete with flashing neon signs and forced-perspective streets), the story concerns one Arch Hammer (Harry Townes), a two-bit hood gifted with the ability to change his facial features. In rapid succession, he assumes the personalities of two recently deceased individuals -- jazz musician Johnny Foster (Ross Martin) and murdered gangster Virgil Sterig (Phillip Pine) -- for his own financial and sexual gain. But Arch comes to grief when, pursued by Sterig's killers, he transforms his face into that of punkish prizefighter Andy Marshak (Don Gordon). Enchancing the episode's dramatic clout is a brilliant performance by Beverly Garland as a nightclub singer and a driving musical score by Jerry Goldsmith. "The Four of Us Are Dying" was written by Rod Serling from a story by George Clayton Johnson(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">The Chaser</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The Chaser. Scripted by Robert Presnell, Jr. from a short story by John Collier, this Twilight Zone episode focuses on Robert Shackleforth (George Grizzard), a lovestruck young man who cannot get the girl of his dreams, the ravishing Leila (Patricia Barry), to acknowledge his existence. In desperation, Robert pays a visit to the mysterious Professor Daemon (John McIntyre), who gives the young would-be romeo a potion that transforms the icy Leila into Robert's "love slave." Before long, however, Robert regrets having Leila hanging upon him like a clinging vine, leading him to contemplate using Daemon's special antidote: The dreaded "glove cleaner." Previously dramatized in 1951 on Billy Rose Television Theater, "The Chaser" made its Twilight Zone bow on May 13, 1960(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A Passage for Trumpet. Written by Rod Serling, this episode represented the joint Twilight Zone debut of actor Jack Klugman (who went on to star in three additional episodes) and director Don Medford. Klugman stars as trumpet player Joey Crown, who, regarding his life as empty and futile, tries to kill himself. Instead, he is briefly hurtled into Limbo, where he learns a number of valuable lessons from a mysterious musician named Gabe (played by Twilight Zone "regular" John Anderson). Originally telecast May 20, 1960, "A Passage for Trumpet" was the first of four Twilight Zone episodes introduced by the "big-eye" opening logo. Also: watch for a brief "inside joke" when Joey Crown passes by a construction company named for series producer Buck Houghton(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A World of His Own. The first season Twilight Zone came to a delightful conclusion on July 1, 1960, with this episode, written by Richard Matheson. Coming home early one afternoon, Victoria West (Phyllis Kirk) is shocked to find her playwright husband Gregory West (Keenan Wynn) in the arms of another woman named Mary (Mary LaRoche). When Victoria demands an explanation, Gregory is forced to reveal that Mary was purely a figment of his imagination, "invented" on the writer's tape recorder. To prove this point, Gregory not only makes Mary re-appear, but also a "huge, red-eyed element." But this is not the only surprise in store for the nonplussed Victoria West. The hilarious finale finds series creator Rod Serling joining in on the festivities(n)</desc>

Originally titled "Nobody Here but Us Martians," this darkly comic Twilight Zone episode was a rewrite of (and vast improvement upon) an unfilmed Rod Serling script from 1958, "The Night of the Big Rain." Having spotted what they think is a UFO, two highway patrolmen converge upon a roadside diner, where an interesting cross-section of humanity has gathered. The patrolmen plant the suggestion that one of the patrons is actually a "spy" from another planet, a suggestion scoffed at by such likely suspects as taciturn Mr. Ross (John Hoyt) and scraggly vagabond Avery (Jack Elam). The check-checkmate ending is one of the series' most memorable, thanks to the skillful underplaying of Barney Phillips as the diner's sarcastic counterman. "Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up?" first aired May 26, 1961(n)</desc>

Deducing that TV viewers would be more emotionally affected by a woman in distress, Serling rewrote the main character as Nan Adams, with Inger Stevens filling the role. While making a cross-country motor trip, Nan is terrified by the repeated appearances of a shabby-looking hitchhiker (Leonard Strong) who shows up at every turn and who seems to be beckoning her to. . .what?

    <desc lang="en">Dust. Wandering into the small Mexican town where Luis Gallegos (John Alonso) is about to be hanged, mercenary peddler Sykes (Thomas Gomez) sells the rope to the hangman, then turns around and sells a handful of "magic dust" to the condemned man's father (Vladimir Sokoloff). Lying through his teeth, Sykes insists that the dust will spread goodwill throughout the community -- and, it is hoped, will spare Gallegos' life. One doesn't have to be a diehard Twilight Zone fan to guess what will happen next. Douglas Heyes, Jr., son of the episode's director, plays a small role. Written by Rod Serling, "Dust" was first telecast January 6, 1961(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Back There</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Back There. After speculating on the possibility that a person can travel back in time and change history, Peter Corrigan (Russell Johnson) bids farewell to his friends and prepares to head home from his club. As he walks through the doors, he is unexpectedly transported from 1961 to 1865. Once he gets his bearings, Corrigan finds himself in a position to prevent the assassination of Abraham Lincoln -- but this "wrinkle in time" turns out to have entirely different results. Scripted by Rod Serling, "Back There" is one of the lesser offerings of Twilight Zone's 1960-61 season, though it does boast an excellent musical score by Jerry Goldsmith, which would remain in the standard TV stock-music repertoire throughout the 1960s and 1970s. The episode first aired January 13, 1961(n)</desc>

Hunnicutt's prevaricating nature undergoes a terrifying about-face when a spooky old man (George Chandler sells Harvey a dilapidated Model A Ford -- one which compels its owner to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. The punchline of this episode will be amusing only to those who lived through the darkest days of the Cold War (though a passing reference to "Jack Kennedy" has been excised from most existing prints). Future Laugh-In regular Arte Johnson appears as Hunnicutt's long-suffering assistant. One of six Twilight Zone episodes shot on videotape, "The Whole Truth" was written by Rod Serling and was initially telecast on January 20, 1961(n)</desc>

Making his second appearance on the series, Burgess Meredith stars as Luther Dingle, a mild-mannered salesman whom a pair of Martians select for a most unusual experiment. The aliens endow Dingle with the strength of 300 men, a gift which he eventually abuses and loses. The ending of this one is a beaut. Don Rickles costars as an obnoxious horse player, displaying the same comic invective with which he infested his nightlclub act. Written by Rod Serling, "Mr. Dingle, the Strong" would be remade, after a fashion, as the third-season Twilight Zone entry "Cavender Is Coming."(n)</desc>

It is Ace's contention that Jimbo's unsual gift will enable him to "fix" dice games and roulette wheels without detection, and for a while this proves to be the case. But what Ace hasn't counted on is the fact that Jimbo has a conscience -- and that Jimbo is disgusted by Ace's cavalier treatment of his erstwhile girlfriend Kitty Cavanaugh (Christine White).

    <desc lang="en">A Hundred Yards Over the Rim. After briefly experimenting with the videotape format, The Twilight Zone wisely returned to film with this episode, which originally aired April 7, 1961. The story begins in the California desert in 1847; Chris Horn (Cliff Robertson), leader of a bedraggled wagon train, sets out to search for food, water, and medicine for himself, his ailing child, and the rest of his party. Upon climbing "over the rim," Chris finds himself in a roadside diner -- in the year 1961. The supporting cast includes future TV-series stars Ed Platt (Get Smart) and John Astin (The Addams Family), as well as actress Evans Evans, who later played Gene Wilder's wife in the 1967 film classic Bonnie and Clyde. Written by Rod Serling, "A Hundred Yards over the Rim" benefits immeasurably from a driving musical score by Fred Steiner, which would pop up in truncated form in dozens of films and TV series throughout the '60s and '70s(n)</desc>

The star is cast as Archibald Beechcroft, a dyed-in-the-wool misanthrope who despises everyone around him. With the help of an unusual "will power" book given to him by office boy Henry (Jack Grinnage), Beechcroft is able to make everyone else in the world disappear. Before long, however, the silence drives Beechcroft crazy, so he decides to populate the world with millions of Archibald Beechcrofts -- with similarly irksome results.

Some five years after a devastating war that wiped out virtually all mankind, a pair of surviving soldiers from opposing armies confront each other in the deserted streets of a bombed-out city. Only the male soldier, played by Charles Bronson, has any dialogue; the female soldier, played by Elizabeth Montgomery, prefers to do her "talking" with a high-powered rifle. While the episode's ending is inevitable, the buildup to that ending takes a variety of unexpected twists and turns. Filmed on the old Hal Roach Studios backlot, "Two" originally aired September 15, 1961(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Nothing in the Dark. Written by George Clayton Johnson, this low-key Twilight Zone episode stars Gladys Cooper as Wanda Dann, an old woman terrified at the prospect of death. Sequestering herself in a shabby basement apartment, Wanda refuses to let anyone past her door, fearful that one of her visitors might be Death himself. And then late one evening, she lets down her guard long enough to offer shelter to wounded policeman Harold Belden (played by a very young Robert Redford).

    <desc lang="en">A Stop at Willoughby. First telecast May 6, 1960, A Stop at Willoughby was scripter Rod Serling's favorite of the first-season Twilight Zone episodes. Plagued by a pushy boss (Howard I. Smith) and a vitriolic wife (Patricia Donahue), ulcerated businessman Gart Williams (James Daly) briefly dozes off while taking the commuter train home. When he awakens, the train has changed to a 19th century model -- as has the conductor, who invites Williams to get off at the peaceful, picture-postcard town of Willoughby.

    <sub-title lang="en">The Shelter</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The Shelter. One of the few Twilight Zone episodes with virtually no sci-fi/fantasy trappings whatsoever, this is nonetheless a disturbing and unsettling half hour. In the midst of a surprise birthday party, the revellers are shocked to hear a Civil Defense announcement on the radio, declaring that America is under attack from UFOs. Only Dr. Stockton (Larry Gates) has had the foresight to build a bomb shelter, and before long, he and his family are besieged by desperate neighbors, demanding to be allowed to take refuge in Stockton's cellar. As tensions reach a fever pitch, all of the suppressed hostilities and prejudices of the neighbors come rushing to the surface -- a dangerous situation reminiscent of the finale of the first-season episode "The Monsters are Due on Maple Street," minus the extraterrestrial punchline. Written by Rod Serling, "The Shelter" first aired on September 29, 1961(n)</desc>

The woman becomes very upset at the comments and dies soon thereafter, leaving Jerry torn between attending the funeral and playing in a big softball game. As usual, Elaine is only interested in who will get the late woman's apartment.

Both of these elements come into play when the two meet Elaine's gruff father, Alton Benes, at the airport. George is scolded for constantly singing the tune and Jerry is forced to have his jacket ruined by the falling snow because Alton refuses to be seen with him wearing it with the lining-side out. Meanwhile, Elaine and Kramer run into some trouble with a magician's doves.

    <desc lang="en">Da Boom. Peter (voice of Seth MacFarlane) is excited about New Year's Eve, until a man in a chicken suit outside the supermarket tells him about Y2K. "What are you selling?" asks the initially confused Peter. "Chicken or sex jelly?" No one in the family takes the threat seriously except Peter, who ruins their New Year's plans by locking them in the basement. They wear radiation suits and watch the neon alabaster clam drop at midnight in downtown Quahog on TV. A second later, the world ends. Planes drop out of the sky, and every other dire warning about Y2K comes true. After Peter foolishly squanders their dehydrated food supply, the family hits the road, searching for a Twinkie factory in Natick. They manage to elude Jorad and his easily distracted band of highway warriors. They find an old man who's got plenty of room in his house and a healthy apple tree in the backyard, but they're driven away by fellow survivor Randy Newman, who sings about everything he sees. Eventually, they find the Twinkie factory and set about rebuilding civilization with Peter in charge. Aside from Stewie (voice of Seth MacFarlane) sprouting tentacles, everything seems to be going well. But Peter angers the townspeople when decides that New Quahog will be safer if he takes the town's irrigation pipes and converts them into guns. "A chicken in every pot and a cap in every ass," is his motto. This episode features guest voice appearances by Victoria Principal and Patrick Duffy(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey</title>
    <desc lang="en">Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) joins Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and a band of dwarves led by the brave Thorin (Richard Armitage) on a treacherous quest to reclaim their mountain home from the fierce dragon Smaug in this epic fantasy adventure adapted from J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved novel by the creative forces behind the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Long before Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) made his arduous journey to Mordor, his brave uncle Bilbo embarked on an adventure for the ages. Bilbo's story gets under way when the great wizard Gandalf appears at his front gate with a most unusual offer. Displaced from their massive fortress in the Lonely Mountain by Smaug - a greedy dragon who coveted their gold - a community of noble dwarves were decimated by a surprise attack by monstrous orcs, whose dreaded leader the Pale Orc slew their king in a gruesome battle. Now, Thorin, the descendent of the king, is determined to reclaim his mountain kingdom for his people. Together with a fearless team of dwarves, Thorin and Gandalf recruit Bilbo to aid them in their quest since Hobbits have the unique ability to go undetected when they wish to. Before Bilbo, Gandalf, and the dwarves can reach The Lonely Mountain and defeat Smaug, however, they'll have to contend with trolls, goblins, stone giants, Gollum (Andy Serkis), and even the dreaded Pale Orc himself. Peter Jackson directs a screenplay he co-penned with Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, and Guillermo del Toro(n)</desc>
