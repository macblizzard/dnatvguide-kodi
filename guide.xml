    <title lang="en">Panic Room</title>
    <desc lang="en">A well-regarded spec script by A-list screenwriter David Koepp became this stylish thriller from director David Fincher. Jodie Foster stars as Meg Altman, a single mother of an diabetic preteen daughter, Sarah (Kristen Stewart). Meg's going through an unhappy divorce that forces her and Sarah to move into a new home. They choose a deluxe New York brownstone that coincidentally boasts an unusual feature: a "panic room," a vault-like hidden space capable of literally sealing itself off from the rest of the building. With its thick steel door on springs, separate ventilation and communications systems, and video monitors linked to cameras mounted throughout the home, the room is an impregnable fortress. It quickly comes in handy when the Altmans' new residence is invaded by a trio of thieves: Junior (Jared Leto), Burnham (Forest Whitaker), and Raoul (Dwight Yoakam). Meg and Sarah are able to secure themselves in the panic room before the robbers can get to them, but it turns out that Sarah's medication is still on the outside, the phone's not yet connected, and the loot the gang's seeking is inside the panic room with them. A cat-and-mouse battle of wits ensues, with Meg trying to outwit their captors over the course of one very long night, as her daughter's health dissipates. Panic Room (2002) co-stars Ann Magnuson, Patrick Bauchau, and Koepp's fellow screenwriter, Andrew Kevin Walker, in a cameo role(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Rocker</title>
    <desc lang="en">The Office star Rainn Wilson portrays a drummer named "Fish," who gets a second shot at fame 20 years after getting kicked out of his band on the very night they signed the record contract that made them stars. Fish has spent the past two decades languishing at soul-crushing day jobs while his old bandmates became legends, continuing to grace magazine covers and dominate the radio. He might just get another chance at musical success, however, when his teenage cousin invites him to drum for his high school garage band, and they end up catching the ear of record executives. Now, Fish is determined to live the hedonistic rock &amp; roll lifestyle he missed out on 20 years ago, but his new bandmates don't appreciate his hard partying -- and neither do his middle-aged knees. This Fox Atomic comedy co-stars Christina Applegate. Shawn Levy (Night at the Museum) and Tom McNulty co-produced the feature, which was penned by Wallace Wolodarsky and Maya Forbes, and directed by Peter Cattaneo (Opal Dream)(n)</desc>

Dalton (Patrick Swayze) has a Ph.D., but rather than make a living teaching Socrates at some university, he's opted to become a top-drawer "cooler" -- an expert barroom bouncer who can break up fights without getting himself killed in the process. Dalton is hired to keep the peace at the Double Duce, a rough-and-tumble honky tonk in Jasper, Missouri, where beer-soaked free-for-alls are a nightly event. Dalton is hurt on his first night on the job, and he is patched up by "Doc" Clay (Kelly Lynch), a beautiful woman working as the town's physician. Dalton and Doc immediately hit it off, but Dalton learns that another man, Brad Wesley (Ben Gazzara), already has his eye on her. Wesley is a man used to getting his way; he's an extortionist and crime boss who has nearly everyone in Jasper under his thumb, and he sets out to teach Dalton a lesson, while Dalton is determined to clean up the town like he breaks up brawls at the Double Duce. Sam Elliott plays Dalton's mentor Wade, and Red West, a one-time member of Elvis Presley's "Memphis Mafia," appears as Webster; Canadian blues-rock guitarist Jeff Healey leads the Double Duce house band(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Bring It On Again</title>
    <desc lang="en">Whittier (Anne Judson-Yager) arrives at the fictional California State College hoping to join the national champion varsity cheerleading team. She meets up with her friend from cheerleading camp, Monica (Faune Chambers), and they're both impressive at the tryouts. Head cheerleader Tina (Bree Turner) is ready to ask them to join the team, but Dean Sebastian (Kevin Cooney) goes a step further, telling Tina that Whittier will be the next head cheerleader. This angers Tina's pal Marni (Joie Lenz), who had the position staked out, but Tina goes along with the plan, taking Whittier under her wing. Whittier meets Derek (Richard Lee Jackson), a campus deejay who immediately takes a shine to her. But Tina is very demanding and controlling. She warns Whittier that Derek is not the type of boy she should be dating. Monica is bothered by Tina's meddling, but Whittier momentarily lets her cheerleading ambition get the better of her, and breaks it off with Derek. Then Tina, upset with Monica's sassy attitude, forces Whittier to choose between her friendship and the squad. Whittier and Monica get fed up and quit the team, but Whittier's school spirit cannot be suppressed. With Monica's help, she gathers up the outcasts from the drama club, the dance club, and other groups that have lost their funding and forms a ragtag squad of her own, determined to battle the varsity squad for a spot at the national championship. Directed by Damon Santostefano (Three to Tango), Bring It On Again was released straight-to-video; aside from its subject matter, it has no direct connection to the original Bring It On(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Brideless Groom</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Brideless Groom. Shemp Howard plays a vocal coach in this Three Stooges short. His most adoring student is a homely young miss who cheerfully mangles "The Voice of Spring." As soon as her lesson is over, Moe and Larry show up and inform him that his Uncle Caleb has left him a half a million dollars -- provided that he is married by six o'clock that evening. Shemp needs a bride in a hurry, so he heads to a phone booth with his little black book and a handful of nickels, but he only manages to get tangled up with Moe. Then he sees a pretty girl (Christine McIntyre), who's a new resident in the building, but she turns out to be a violent psychopath. Shemp has no choice but to take his awful voice student to the altar, but as the justice of the peace (Emil Sitka) is preparing to wed them, an angry group of Shemp's former girlfriends show up -- Moe ran a notice in the paper announcing his dilemma. The women battle furiously to become Shemp's bride, and the Stooges are all the worse for wear. The semi-conscious Shemp manages to say "I do" to the singing student, and when he comes to and realizes what he's done, his response is to scream, "Help!" If this short bears a few similarities to the Buster Keaton silent Seven Chances, it could be because writer Clyde Bruckman worked on both films. Emil Sitka's line, "Hold hands, you lovebirds," was immortalized in Pulp Fiction -- it can be heard while John Travolta is pumping a hypodermic full of adrenaline into the overdosed Uma Thurman(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Stir of Echoes</title>
    <desc lang="en">In this supernatural thriller, Tom Witzky (Kevin Bacon) is a fairly typical working-class guy living in Chicago with his wife Maggie (Kathryn Erbe) and his son Jake (Zachary David Cope). One night at a party, Tom gets into a lively discussion with his sister-in-law, Lisa (Illeana Douglas), who believes in psychic communication and the power of hypnosis. He challenges Lisa to hypnotize him, and she plants in him a post-hypnotic suggestion to be more open-minded. But the results aren't quite what Lisa or Tom expected; Tom now senses an air of terrible dread throughout his house and is convinced that evil lurks just around the corner. He also sees the spirit of a girl from the neighborhood who disappeared months ago -- and Jake sees the spirit as well. Stir of Echoes was based on a novel by Richard Matheson, whose work inspired such disparate films as Somewhere in Time and The Incredible Shrinking Man; it was written and directed by David Koepp, who wrote the screenplays for Jurassic Park and Mission: Impossible(n)</desc>

The actor has only one photo of his ancestor, which shows him aged roughly 17 and wearing a military uniform. By zooming in on the picture, Martin's brother was able to identify their grandfather's badge, which suggests he was in the Royal Marines. Now, by meeting with a military historian, Martin tries to fill in the rest of the story, and in the process learns more about Edwin's role in defending Birmingham against German air assaults during the Second World War.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">For most women multiple orgasms can seem almost mythical. But some can experience it not once, twice or even 10 times, but 60, 70 or 100 - a super-orgasm. In this documentary, a group of these women volunteer for a series of tests in a scientific investigation to reveal the truth behind the super-orgasm. The aim is to measure and record the phenomenon for the first time, finding out how the brain and the body react before, during and after, and asking if these women are wired differently to other people. And if not, is it something that could be learned by anyone?.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Raising Arizona</title>
    <desc lang="en">Combining influences from Tex Avery cartoons to Sam Raimi horror movies to 1940s B-movies, Joel Coen and Ethan Coen followed up the stylish film noir of their debut, Blood Simple (1984), with this frantic screwball comedy. H.I. "Hi" McDonnough (Nicholas Cage) is a philosophical but slightly dim career criminal who has been arrested so often that he gets to know "Ed," short for Edwina (Holly Hunter), the officer who takes his mug shots. Hi takes a shine to Ed and promises to go straight if she marries him. She accepts, and they move to the Arizona desert, where Hi holds down a factory job and blissfully watches the sunsets with Ed. Their serenity is shattered when the couple decides that they want a child and discover that, as Hi puts it, "Ed's womb was a rocky place where my seed could find no purchase." (One of the film's many delights is Hi's unexpectedly flowery dime-novel narration.) Ed goes into a severe depression until she sees an item in the news. Nathan Arizona (Trey Wilson), owner of a chain of unpainted furniture stores, has become the father of quintuplets, and he and his wife joke that they now have more children than they know what to do with. In what seems like a perfect "helps you, helps me" situation, Hi and Ed kidnap one of the Arizona infants, figuring that they'll have a baby and the Arizonas will have less of a burden(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Raising Arizona</title>
    <desc lang="en">Combining influences from Tex Avery cartoons to Sam Raimi horror movies to 1940s B-movies, Joel Coen and Ethan Coen followed up the stylish film noir of their debut, Blood Simple (1984), with this frantic screwball comedy. H.I. "Hi" McDonnough (Nicholas Cage) is a philosophical but slightly dim career criminal who has been arrested so often that he gets to know "Ed," short for Edwina (Holly Hunter), the officer who takes his mug shots. Hi takes a shine to Ed and promises to go straight if she marries him. She accepts, and they move to the Arizona desert, where Hi holds down a factory job and blissfully watches the sunsets with Ed. Their serenity is shattered when the couple decides that they want a child and discover that, as Hi puts it, "Ed's womb was a rocky place where my seed could find no purchase." (One of the film's many delights is Hi's unexpectedly flowery dime-novel narration.) Ed goes into a severe depression until she sees an item in the news. Nathan Arizona (Trey Wilson), owner of a chain of unpainted furniture stores, has become the father of quintuplets, and he and his wife joke that they now have more children than they know what to do with. In what seems like a perfect "helps you, helps me" situation, Hi and Ed kidnap one of the Arizona infants, figuring that they'll have a baby and the Arizonas will have less of a burden(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Treasure Hunters</title>
    <sub-title lang="en">Raw Treasure.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Dallas Campbell and Ellie Harrison present the first of two programmes in which they embark on the ultimate treasure hunt, searching the globe to uncover its extraordinary riches, from natural gems to precious metals - and more besides. Dallas begins his search Down Under, free-diving for lustrous pearls in the waters around north-west Australia and seeking out diamonds from the bottom of the ocean. He also learns about opal mining in one of the most hostile places on Earth and, together with Ellie, reveals how ambergris, a substance that starts life in a sperm whale's stomach, can prove an expensive ingredient in perfume. Plus, how one of the largest and most unusual treasures has helped solve a 67-million-year-old puzzle.(n)</desc>

In Transylvanian caves, she discovers evidence of a conflict between a cave bear and a lion, both of which became victims of a deep freeze that swept across Europe, while in Siberia she finds that the well-preserved remains of a female woolly rhinoceros demonstrate it was perfectly evolved to face the bitter conditions in Yakutsk - the coldest city on Earth. Alice also travels to a Jersey cave, where archaeological findings shed light on how Ice Age human beings and Neanderthals fashioned stone tools to hunt mammoths.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Based on the novel by Michael Shaara, For Love of the Game brought Kevin Costner back to the world of baseball after his successes with Bull Durham (1988) and Field of Dreams (1989). Billy Chapel (Kevin Costner) is a star pitcher with the Detroit Tigers, standing on the mound at Yankee Stadium and throwing what is shaping up to be a perfect game with the help of his best friend and catcher, Gus Osinski (John C. Reilly). However, Billy is having a hard time keeping his mind on the game; he's come to a crossroads in both his personal and professional lives, and he isn't sure what to do or where to go. He's learned that the Tigers are about to be sold, and the new owners intend to trade him at the end of the season, and that his girlfriend Jane (Kelly Preston) is planning to leave him. For Love of the Game represents a change of pace for director Sam Raimi, best-known for the Evil Dead trilogy and the acclaimed suspense drama A Simple Plan (1998) (although Raimi, a baseball fan born in Michigan, doubtless enjoyed making a film featuring the Detroit Tigers)(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Machine Gun Preacher</title>
    <desc lang="en">Gerard Butler stars in Marc Forster's violent, fact-based drama about a substance-addicted criminal who finds God and relocates to Sudan to offer his own idiosyncratic brand of Christian charity. The film initially portrays Sam Childers as being a far from nice man: a misogynistic biker whose life is steeped in crime, narcotics and violence, and who quickly returns to armed robbery almost as soon as he's released from jail. But while he was inside, his wife Lynn found Jesus, and, after Sam gets stabbed, she urges him to join her at church. Sam subsequently has his own Damascene moment and starts life afresh, founding his own (legitimate) construction company. Before long he has also built his own church. But it's only after a trip to Sudan, where he witnesses the devastation wrought by the marauding Lord's Resistance Army, that he truly becomes driven. Relocating to the African country, he sets up a faith-based centre to care for victims of the LRA's violence and rape. And also takes up arms to literally fight the good fight...

    <title lang="en">Reign Of Fire</title>
    <desc lang="en">Medieval fantasy meets futuristic science fiction in this effects-heavy action epic from former X-Files director Rob Bowman. In present-day London, 12-year-old Quinn Abercromby witnesses the awakening of a hibernating dragon from a centuries-long slumber, the result of a construction dig supervised by his mother and an incident for which Quinn feels partially responsible. Twenty years later, the adult Quinn (Christian Bale) is the fire chief of a refortified castle community, responsible for dousing the blazes lit by the dragon's prodigious number of flame-spewing offspring, airborne juggernauts that have wreaked havoc across the globe, torching civilization and turning humans into an endangered species. Hope arrives in the form of Denton "Dragon Slayer" Van Zan (Matthew McConaughey), an American known to be the only man to ever kill one of the dragons, and Alex (Izabella Scorupco), a scientist/pilot who's a member of Van Zan's army, a zealous fighting force that includes a secret weapon: the Archangels, paratroopers using themselves as bait to attract and then dispatch the deadly beasts. Reign of Fire (2002) co-stars Gerard Butler, Alice Krige, and Alexander Siddig(n)</desc>

It all begins when Frodo receives a ring from his uncle Bilbo (Ian Holm) and wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) discovers it is the Unique Ring itself. This powerful ring has been conceived by Sauron, the dark Lord of Mordor (Sala Baker), and with it, it is possible to enslave the whole of the Middle-earth through the use of dark forces. To destroy the ring, Frodo must take it to a distant mountain in Mordor, a region controlled by the Master of Evil. Fortunately, he is accompanied by a group formed by Hobbits Sam (Sean Astin), Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), as well as Gandalf, the human warriors Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and Boromir (Sean Bean), and elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom). Together they have to confront dangerous obstacles in a frightening world of mystery and darkness. This spectacular adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's epic trilogy was directed by Peter Jackson(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Marge Gets a Job. The Simpson family's home is in sad shape -- the house has slipped from its foundation, and has begun sliding on an angle into the ground. Surly Joe, proprietor of the only foundation-repair firm in town, tells Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) and Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) that it will cost 8,500 dollars to set the house right. This is more than the family budget can handle at the moment, so Marge decides to look for a job. After Lisa (voice of Yeardley Smith) encourages Marge to beef up her resumé with a creative approach to the facts, she lands a job at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, where Homer works. It isn't long before C. Montgomery Burns (voice of Harry Shearer), the ancient and ill-tempered owner of the plant, develops a powerful infatuation with Marge, and he's willing to do whatever he must to win her heart away from her husband, including a candlelight dinner with music from Marge's favorite singer, Tom Jones (performing his own voice), who has been specially kidnapped for the occasion. Meanwhile, Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright) discovers his habit of telling tall tales is catching up with him when he finds himself trailed by an escaped wolf -- but given his history of spinning whoppers, no one believes him. "Marge Gets a Job."(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The 10 remaining amateur cooks' tart-making abilities are put to the test in the third round of the competition. Their first task is to bake a tarte Tatin, with judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry looking for intriguing flavour combinations to tickle their tastebuds. The hopefuls then face another daunting technical challenge as they try to replicate Mary's seemingly straightforward recipe for treacle tart, but the delicate task of adding a lattice top leaves some contestants flummoxed. Finally, they try to create an ornate fruit tart fit for gracing the window display of a leading patisserie - before discovering the identities of the latest Star Baker and the person who will be heading home. Presented by Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins. From 2012.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Accused of cheating and desperate to prove his innocence, an eighteen-year-old orphan from the slums of Mumbai reflects back on his tumultuous life while competing to win 20 million rupees on India's Who Wants to Be a Millionaire in Danny Boyle's inspirational drama. Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) may not have a penny to his name, but that could all change in a matter of hours. He's one question away from taking the top prize on India's most popular television game show, but as with everything else in Jamal's life, it isn't going to be easy. Arrested by police under suspicion of cheating, Jamal is interrogated by the authorities. The police simply can't believe that a common "slumdog" could possibly possess the knowledge to get this far in the game, and in order to convince them of how he gained such knowledge, Jamal begins reflecting back on his childhood. As young boys, Jamal and his older brother, Salim, lived in squalor, and lost their mother in a mob attack on Muslims. Subsequently forced to rely on their own wits to survive, the desperate siblings fell back on petty crime, eventually befriending adorable yet feisty young Latika as they sought out food and shelter on the unforgiving streets of Mumbai. Though life on the streets was never easy, Jamal's experiences ultimately instilled in him the knowledge he needed to answer the tough questions posed to him on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. And though Jamal makes a convincing case for himself, one question still remains: why would a young man with no apparent desire for wealth or fame be so determined to win big on a national game show? Of course, it won't be long until everyone finds out the answer to this burning question, because as Jamal sits down to find out whether he will be rich beyond his wildest dreams, 60 million viewers remain transfixed to their televisions eager to see if he'll correctly answer the final question(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Just Married</title>
    <desc lang="en">Can a new marriage survive meddling friends, disapproving families, and some of the worst accommodations in Europe? That's the question posed in this broad comedy. Tom Leezak (Ashton Kutcher) is a regular guy who likes sports and beer and tries to make ends meet working as a nighttime radio traffic reporter. Sarah McNerney (Brittany Murphy) is a beautiful young woman from a wealthy and privileged family who is trying to make a name for herself as a writer. Tom and Sarah have seemingly nothing in common, but that doesn't stop them from falling in love. Sarah's family doesn't much care for Tom's boorish ways, and Tom's buddies think Sarah is too highbrow for him, but, if anything, this makes the couple all the more determined to be together, and they decide to get married and head off to Italy for a month-long honeymoon despite the pleas of those closest to them. However, even after the knot is tied, Sarah's former beau, Peter Prentiss (Christian Kane), is dead set upon breaking up the happy couple, though as it turns out, a seemingly endless stream of bad luck and post-marital jitters may do the job for him. Just Married was written by Sam Harper, who claims to have loosely based the script on his own experiences on an ill-starred European honeymoon with his wife; fortunately, the couple's marriage survived the experience(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Accused of cheating and desperate to prove his innocence, an eighteen-year-old orphan from the slums of Mumbai reflects back on his tumultuous life while competing to win 20 million rupees on India's Who Wants to Be a Millionaire in Danny Boyle's inspirational drama. Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) may not have a penny to his name, but that could all change in a matter of hours. He's one question away from taking the top prize on India's most popular television game show, but as with everything else in Jamal's life, it isn't going to be easy. Arrested by police under suspicion of cheating, Jamal is interrogated by the authorities. The police simply can't believe that a common "slumdog" could possibly possess the knowledge to get this far in the game, and in order to convince them of how he gained such knowledge, Jamal begins reflecting back on his childhood. As young boys, Jamal and his older brother, Salim, lived in squalor, and lost their mother in a mob attack on Muslims. Subsequently forced to rely on their own wits to survive, the desperate siblings fell back on petty crime, eventually befriending adorable yet feisty young Latika as they sought out food and shelter on the unforgiving streets of Mumbai. Though life on the streets was never easy, Jamal's experiences ultimately instilled in him the knowledge he needed to answer the tough questions posed to him on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. And though Jamal makes a convincing case for himself, one question still remains: why would a young man with no apparent desire for wealth or fame be so determined to win big on a national game show? Of course, it won't be long until everyone finds out the answer to this burning question, because as Jamal sits down to find out whether he will be rich beyond his wildest dreams, 60 million viewers remain transfixed to their televisions eager to see if he'll correctly answer the final question(n)</desc>

And, like all her friends, she dreams of having a chance to appear on it. However, this is Baltimore and it is 1962 - and Tracy's both overweight and, worse, has liberal attitudes to race relations, which don't sit comfortably with the segregationist views of the show's producer.

In Lost and Found, David Spade plays Dylan, who is about to open an new restaurant and has finally found the perfect apartment. The apartment just gets better when he meets his new neighbor, Lila (Sophie Marceau), a very beautiful women who has recently come to the United States from France. However, Lila has just gotten out of a bad relationship with René (Patrick Bruel), who doesn't want to leave her alone, so she has little interest in romance, preferring to devote herself to her cello and her dog Jack. One day, Jack runs away and Dylan finds him; when he returns the pooch to Lila, it's the first time she's been willing to speak in full sentences to him, though not for very long. Faster than you can say "That idea is so crazy it just might work!", Dylan decides to kidnap Jack; when Lila thinks the dog is lost, Dylan will generously volunteer to help look for him, which will give Dylan a chance to impress Lila when he's able to find Jack so quickly. Sure enough, Dylan swipes the dog, but from that point on the plan hardly goes the way he had hoped. Star David Spade also co-wrote the screenplay with J.B. Cook and Marc Meeks; the supporting cast includes Martin Sheen, Mitchell Whitfield, Artie Lang and Jon Lovitz(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Parenthood</title>
    <desc lang="en">This feel-good ensemble comedy tracks a quartet of suburban siblings and their families over the course of a single summer. Hardworking Gil Buckman (Steve Martin) and his stay-at-home wife, Karen (Mary Steeenburgen), have just a few months to help their oldest son, Kevin (Jasen Fisher), overcome his high-strung behavior problems before he'll be relegated to special-education classes. Gil's difficult relationship with his own father, Frank (Jason Robards), has led him to become a would-be super-dad for his three kids, so he takes his son's difficulties more than a little personally. Gil's sister, Helen (Dianne Wiest), is trying to raise a moody, adolescent son (Leaf Phoenix) and an independent-minded daughter (Martha Plimpton) with no help from her well-off ex-husband, who's more interested in his new wife and family. Gil and Helen's sister, Susan (Harley Jane Kozak), meanwhile, must participate in the too-scripted Big Life Plans of her anal-retentive husband, Nathan (Rick Moranis), whose overachiever zeal infects even their toddler daughter. When long-lost brother Larry (Tom Hulce) show up with yet another get-rich-quick scheme, he brings with him a surprise addition to the family. Screenwriters Babaloo Mandel, Lowell Ganz, and Ron Howard negotiate their varied subplots with a deftness and comedic touch that transforms this conflicted clan into a suburban everyfamily(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Last Mimzy</title>
    <desc lang="en">An intergalactic package discovered on the beach holds a myriad of fantastic discoveries for siblings Noah and Emma Wilder in The Last Mimzy, studio head-turned-director Bob Shaye's wondrous sci-fi fantasy parable. The children stumble onto their discovery amid a trip to the family beach house, and find inside of the crate strange crystals that Emma levitates with her mind, as well as the Mimzy -- a stuffed bunny with a built-in supercomputer that advances its possessor's brain by great leaps and bounds by whispering into the person's ear. Meanwhile, via interaction with the box and its contents, Noah gains the ability to converse with spiders and instructs them to build miniature bridges. He also etches complex Tibetan mandalas, and somehow manages to black out half of Seattle. The children naturally keep these happenings (and the box) from their mom and dad (Joely Richardson and Timothy Hutton), but in time the kids set their sights higher and embark on correcting huge problems that cannot be missed. Rainn Wilson (The Office) co-stars as the children's hippie science teacher; New Age expert Bruce Joel Rubin (Ghost, Jacob's Ladder) and Toby Emmerich co-authored the script, adapting the 1943 short story Mimsy Were the Borogoves, by Lewis Padgett(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">M Night Shyamalan's widely acclaimed chiller about a boy who has the not-entirely-welcome ability to directly contact the dead. Bruce Willis stars as child psychologist Dr Malcolm Crowe, who is asked to help Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), who claims he can 'see dead people'. Crowe is sceptical at first, but - prompted partly by a similar case from his past, who he felt he badly let down - he's gradually convinced that the boy is telling the truth. Crowe believes that actively engaging with the ghostly presences could help both Sear and the spirits to find peace. Overcoming his terror, the lad finds that communicating with the deceased does, at first, seem to be beneficial. But then matters take on their own momentum, leading to one of the director's trademark plot twists..(n)</desc>

Teen Tracy Turnblad's regular cultural highlight is a local television music-and-dance programme called The Corny Collins Show. And, like all her friends, she dreams of having a chance to appear on it. However, this is Baltimore and it is 1962 - and Tracy's both overweight and, worse, has liberal attitudes to race relations, which don't sit comfortably with the segregationist views of the show's producer. But, could Tracy's ambitions for not only appearing on the show, but also racially integrating it, receive a fillip when she meets the son of Motormouth Maybelle, host of the monthly 'Negro Day' edition of the show? Also starring John Travolta (in drag and a fat-suit) as Tracy's mum, Christopher Walken, as her dad, and Amanda Bynes, James Marsden, Brittany Snow, Zac Efron and Elijah Kelley; plus cameos from the star of the original movie, Ricki Lake, and its director, John Waters(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The wind whispers ominous warnings of death before a malevolent entity arrives to claim the life of a young girl as director Courtney Solomon brings author Brent Monahan's chilling, fact-based story of supernatural murder to the screen in this tale of terror starring Donald Sutherland and Sissy Spacek. The year is 1818 and the Bell family is a quiet clan residing on a remote farm in Red River, TN. A normal, loving family by all accounts, the uneventful lives of the Bell family begin to take a dark turn when strange noises around the farm are followed by the arrival of a black wolf with piercing yellow eyes said to strike unspeakable fear into the very soul of all who encounter it. As the sadistic spirit singles out the youngest daughter of the Bell family for torment and her frightened parents search frantically for a rational explanation to the chilling events unfolding in their once-happy home, an eerie, disembodied voice promises death from beyond the grave. With the struggle rapidly turning violent and the Bells' desperate prayers for mercy going unanswered time and again, the shocking murder that followed would prove the only case in recorded American history where the death of a human being was directly attributed to an attack by an evil entity or spirit(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Academy Award-nominated for his groundbreaking animated short of the same name, filmmaker Shane Acker makes his feature directorial debut with this expanded version of his acclaimed post-apocalyptic fable. In a world parallel to our own, the worst has happened, and humanity is in danger of extinction. From the ashes of destruction emerges a courageous rag doll named 9 (voice of Elijah Wood) whose unique leadership skills could prove the key to survival for those who have not yet perished. Perhaps with a little help from his friends, who include domineering war veteran 1 (voice of Christopher Plummer), aging inventor 2 (voice of Martin Landau), stout mechanic 5 (voice of John C. Reilly), visionary artist 6 (voice of Crispin Glover), and fearless warrior 7 (voice of Jennifer Connelly), 9 will prove capable of salvaging what still remains of this world, and laying the groundwork for a hopeful future. Produced by Tim Burton, Timur Bekmambetov (Wanted, Night Watch), and Jim Lemley (The Diving Bell and the Butterfly), 9 takes viewers on a surrealistic journey into a world where anything is possible(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Accused of cheating and desperate to prove his innocence, an eighteen-year-old orphan from the slums of Mumbai reflects back on his tumultuous life while competing to win 20 million rupees on India's Who Wants to Be a Millionaire in Danny Boyle's inspirational drama. Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) may not have a penny to his name, but that could all change in a matter of hours. He's one question away from taking the top prize on India's most popular television game show, but as with everything else in Jamal's life, it isn't going to be easy. Arrested by police under suspicion of cheating, Jamal is interrogated by the authorities. The police simply can't believe that a common "slumdog" could possibly possess the knowledge to get this far in the game, and in order to convince them of how he gained such knowledge, Jamal begins reflecting back on his childhood. As young boys, Jamal and his older brother, Salim, lived in squalor, and lost their mother in a mob attack on Muslims. Subsequently forced to rely on their own wits to survive, the desperate siblings fell back on petty crime, eventually befriending adorable yet feisty young Latika as they sought out food and shelter on the unforgiving streets of Mumbai. Though life on the streets was never easy, Jamal's experiences ultimately instilled in him the knowledge he needed to answer the tough questions posed to him on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. And though Jamal makes a convincing case for himself, one question still remains: why would a young man with no apparent desire for wealth or fame be so determined to win big on a national game show? Of course, it won't be long until everyone finds out the answer to this burning question, because as Jamal sits down to find out whether he will be rich beyond his wildest dreams, 60 million viewers remain transfixed to their televisions eager to see if he'll correctly answer the final question(n)</desc>

Scotty buys an antique desk and -- hidden in a secret compartment -- he finds a letter from a woman named Elizabeth Whitcomb (Jennifer Jason Leigh), who lived during the 19th century. Fascinated by the letter, Scotty writes her a reply, using antique writing materials, and is shocked when he receives a reply -- somehow he's been able to communicate with her through time, and they begin a correspondence that spans a century and a half. It turns out that Elizabeth is also pledged to marry, but she does not love her fiancée, and a romance begins to blossom through the mail and across time. The Love Letter was produced for the television anthology series The Hallmark Hall of Fame(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A belief in "angels on earth," not to mention a belief in oneself, may enhance the enjoyment of this made-for-cable drama. Jaclyn Smith stars as Kay Woodbury, a tough, no-nonsense judge whose intractability in legal matters is intensified by a number of personal crises, including a bitter feud with her jurist father and her anguish over the recent remarriage of her ex-husband. Thus, Kay is no mood to play nice when teenager Sally Powell (Lyndsy Fonseca) is brought before her. Harboring an intense hatred for the father who apparently abandoned her, Sally is a seemingly incorrigible delinquent who has already "flunked out" in four foster homes. Figuring that she could no worse than anyone else, Kay takes Sally home on a trial basis. The girl proceeds to behave as atrociously as possible, but surprisingly Kay does not decide to write her off as a bad job, but instead concludes that what the girl needs is someone to trust and something to believe in. In this spirit, Kay locates Sally's birth father (C. Thomas Howell), and, upon being convinced that he was not motivated by selfishness when he dropped out of his daughter's life, secretly contrives for Sally and her dad to reconnect -- and in so doing Kay finds her own way toward forgiveness, not only of those whom she feels have wronged her, but also of herself. Ordinary Miracles made its Hallmark Channel debut on May 7, 2005(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Kick-Ass</title>
    <desc lang="en">Matthew Vaughn's violent-but-hilarious action movie is a knowing take on the superhero genre, based on Mark Millar and John Romita Jr's comic-book series. Avid comic fan and New York high schooler Dave Lizewski has begun to wonder why his contemporaries are keener on vapid celebrity than wanting to emulate his (super) heroes and try to make the world a better place. Thus Lizewski orders a simply hideous skiing outfit and dons it to become Kick-Ass, scourge of New York's criminals. Well that's the idea, but of course it's his ass that gets kicked when he first tries to put his plan into action. Despite that setback, and spurred on by his desire for a female classmate, he has another go at launching his crime-fighting career. It almost ends as badly as the first one, but this time he's rescued by fellow 'superheroes' Hit Girl and Big Daddy. She's just 11 years old, but has a taste and aptitude for violence that would impress a ninja and swears frequently and badly enough to shock a football fan; he's ever the doting father, gifting her presents of lethal weapons. Together the trio embark on their quest to clean up the city. But waiting in the wings is crime boss Frank D'Amico - and he's no pushover. The film's controversial mix of humour, bad language, sophisticated satire and frequent violence garnered a raft of awards as well as widespread critical acclaim(n)</desc>

However, gangster Eddie Kim has secreted crates of venomous serpents in the cargo hold and when they're released, all hell breaks loose. The film earned a reputation for the inclusion of plot lines from blogging fans, including one now infamous line. Despite the novel approach to its production, David R Ellis's film is surprisingly well-acted and tense, with both Julianna Margulies as flight attendant Claire Miller and David Koechner as co-pilot Rick receiving a fair share of the cracking dialogue(n)</desc>

The year is 2017, and a vampire plague has turned most of the planet's human population into bloodsucking ghouls. As the population of mortals fast begins to dwindle, a vampiric corporation sets out to capture and farm every remaining human while simultaneously researching a consumable blood substitute, headed by undead hematologist Edward Dalton (Ethan Hawke). His work is interrupted after stumbling onto a pocket of human survivors lead by Elvis (Willem Dafoe), a former vampire, whose past reveals a cure that could reverse the tide and save the human race. With time running out, Dalton's only hope lies in outsmarting the security forces of his boss (Sam Neill), whose goal isn't just to find a substitute, but to repopulate humanity in order to sell its blood to the highest bidder(n)</desc>

In the first episode of a two-part story, Addison (Kate Walsh) heads to LA for a reunion old medical-school friends, blissfully unprepared for what it is in store for her.

This episode serves to introduce the future costars of the Grey's Anatomy spinoff Private Practice: Tim Daly (Pete), Amy Brennerman (Violet), Taye Diggs (Sam), Chris Lowell (Dell) and Paul Adelstein (Cooper) (the character of Naomi, here played by Merrin Dungey, would be taken over by Audra McDonald in Private Practice)(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The team visits Belton House stately home near Grantham, Lincolnshire, to investigate the creation of the Machine Gun Corps during the First World War. The regiment was set up in the grounds, but today there is virtually no sign of its existence and most regimental records have been destroyed. The dig, however, is rich in finds, revealing glimpses of the lives of the thousands of men who trained at the site, many of whom died in battle.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Brancaster, Norfolk.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Tony Robinson and the team explore a site at Brancaster in Norfolk that is believed to have been a Roman `shore fort', and possibly a key military outpost. They amass 2,500 finds - their biggest-ever haul - which provide information on contemporary decorative arts, sport and much more, and also undertake a high-definition geophysics survey that generates enough data to crash the computers. The biggest surprise reveals evidence of a high level of trade with the local population, and clues as to how Britons living near the site benefited financially from the Roman presence.(n)</desc>

This programme follows the stories of a variety of visitors, from the King of Uganda to a firefighter who has saved up months of wages, and the workers who serve them.(n)</desc>

Cillian Murphy returns as Birmingham-based mobster Thomas Shelby in the second run of author Steven Knight's period drama, which is set to reunite the Irish star with his Dark Knight Rises colleague Tom Hardy. The first series was a huge success for the BBC, winning plaudits not only for its plot and acting, but also for its amazing production design, which helped create an atmosphere of threat and foreboding in the Midlands immediately after the First World War. Now the action moves on to the Roaring Twenties, and Thomas is determined to expand the legal and illegal sides of the Shelby family business by taking on various interests in the south of England. But an enemy from his past looks set to stand in his way.(n)</desc>

However, some take as long as three years to complete - and the noise of the digging, fleets of concrete mixers and builders' lorries has made daily life hell in some of the capital's poshest neighbourhoods. This documentary tells the story of the conflict that has resulted from some of these improvements, going behind the scenes as Kensington council responds to angry residents, and featuring contributions from owners, builders and irate neighbours.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">David Attenborough's Conquest of the Skies</title>
    <sub-title lang="en">First to Fly.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The veteran naturalist examines the world of flight, travelling across the globe to chart the evolutionary story of those creatures who seemingly defy the rules of gravity by taking to the air. Initially focusing on insects, Attenborough meets a descendant of the dragonfly, before examining the Atlas beetle, which tends to restrict flight to times when it needs a mate or a fresh supply of food. More aesthetically pleasing is a group of beautiful tropical butterflies, followed by an in-depth study into the blow fly - the jet fighter of insects.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">David Attenborough's Conquest of the Skies</title>
    <sub-title lang="en">First to Fly.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The veteran naturalist examines the world of flight, travelling across the globe to chart the evolutionary story of those creatures who seemingly defy the rules of gravity by taking to the air. Initially focusing on insects, Attenborough meets a descendant of the dragonfly, before examining the Atlas beetle, which tends to restrict flight to times when it needs a mate or a fresh supply of food. More aesthetically pleasing is a group of beautiful tropical butterflies, followed by an in-depth study into the blow fly - the jet fighter of insects.(n)</desc>

When the corpse of the man ghost-writing the memoirs of former British Prime Minister Adam Lang is found, apparently having accidentally fallen from a ferry, another writer is quickly hired to finish the job. The new man is dispatched to the ex-PM's swish home in the States. As the writer begins his task, he's frustrated that he's not allowed completely free access to his predecessor's draft but gets on with the work, under pressure from all sides to finish the job quickly. But, later, he uncovers documents, seemingly left by the dead man, which throw a new light on everything: they suggest Lang and his wealthy friends have very dark secrets that they'd kill for. Will the new ghost-writer now suffer the same fate as the previous one? Also starring Olivia Williams, Tom Wilkinson and Kim Cattrall(n)</desc>

When the corpse of the man ghost-writing the memoirs of former British Prime Minister Adam Lang is found, apparently having accidentally fallen from a ferry, another writer is quickly hired to finish the job. The new man is dispatched to the ex-PM's swish home in the States. As the writer begins his task, he's frustrated that he's not allowed completely free access to his predecessor's draft but gets on with the work, under pressure from all sides to finish the job quickly. But, later, he uncovers documents, seemingly left by the dead man, which throw a new light on everything: they suggest Lang and his wealthy friends have very dark secrets that they'd kill for. Will the new ghost-writer now suffer the same fate as the previous one? Also starring Olivia Williams, Tom Wilkinson and Kim Cattrall(n)</desc>

Peter (Keir Dullea) is a mad-killer who terrorizes the women by making threatening telephone calls. As the body count mounts, the women realize that the killer may be in the house. Black Christmas, one of the first of the slasher pictures, is still frightening despite some plot devices which have now become standard and predictable.

    <desc lang="en">When Todd Anderson (Storm P) signs a 30-million-dollar contract with the New Jersey Nets after being named the number one NBA draft pick of the year, his mother (Jenifer Lewis) vows to prevent her son from forgetting his roots. Not used to balancing his new life with his old, Todd mistakenly invites family and friends from his old neighborhood to his multi-million-dollar house for a cookout on the same day of an important endorsement interview. Though his extravagant family cookouts were welcome at his old digs, Todd's stuffy new neighbors -- particularly the conservative Republican Judge Halsted Crowley (Danny Glover) -- are less than thrilled with the arrival of Todd's massive family. Complicating the situation further is the eccentric neighborhood security guard (Queen Latifah), who takes on the heady assignment of ensuring that none of the private community's rules are broken, as well as two thugs who, determined to get an autographed pair of sneakers, hold up the cookout at gunpoint. Directed by Lance Rivera, The Cookout also features performances from Ja Rule, Eve, Farrah Fawcett, and Jonathan Silverman(n)</desc>

Unfortunately there's just one thing standing in between Henry and his bright future -- his high-school principal. An uptight authoritarian with a hard-line anti-marijuana stance, Principal Gordon (Michael Chiklis) announces that the entire senior class will undergo mandatory drug testing, and anyone who refuses will be immediately expelled. Henry has just danced with Mary Jane for the very first time, and now his entire future is on the line thanks to a few innocent tokes. But Henry is a bright kid, and when he and local pothead Travix Breaux (Sean Marquette) put their heads together, they come up with a brilliant plan to subvert the testing policy: if they can just get every student in school stoned, Principal Gordon's plan to crucify his pot-loving charges will go completely up in smoke(n)</desc>

The film stars Jude Law as Vassili, a marksman from the Urals who is transported to Stalingrad in 1942, and a master German sniper, Major Koenig (Ed Harris). Koenig, an expert German sniper, is determined to eliminate his formidable opponent by any means necessary; meanwhile, Vassili has joined forces with Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), a young Russian political adversary, who is impressed by Vassili's skills and raises his profile in the Soviet Union. Both Vassili and Danilov become involved with Tanya (Rachel Weisz), whose Jewish parents have been captured by the Germans and have forced her to take up with the men on a sniper expedition. Koenig and Vassili begin to develop traps for each other, until fate inevitably must bring the two sharpshooters together. This large-scale production, financed mostly by Teuton companies, also features Bob Hoskins as Nikita Krushchev and Ron Perlman as an aging Russian sniper(n)</desc>

The new man is dispatched to the ex-PM's swish home in the States. As the writer begins his task, he's frustrated that he's not allowed completely free access to his predecessor's draft but gets on with the work, under pressure from all sides to finish the job quickly. But, later, he uncovers documents, seemingly left by the dead man, which throw a new light on everything: they suggest Lang and his wealthy friends have very dark secrets that they'd kill for. Will the new ghost-writer now suffer the same fate as the previous one? Also starring Olivia Williams, Tom Wilkinson and Kim Cattrall(n)</desc>

Not used to balancing his new life with his old, Todd mistakenly invites family and friends from his old neighborhood to his multi-million-dollar house for a cookout on the same day of an important endorsement interview. Though his extravagant family cookouts were welcome at his old digs, Todd's stuffy new neighbors -- particularly the conservative Republican Judge Halsted Crowley (Danny Glover) -- are less than thrilled with the arrival of Todd's massive family. Complicating the situation further is the eccentric neighborhood security guard (Queen Latifah), who takes on the heady assignment of ensuring that none of the private community's rules are broken, as well as two thugs who, determined to get an autographed pair of sneakers, hold up the cookout at gunpoint. Directed by Lance Rivera, The Cookout also features performances from Ja Rule, Eve, Farrah Fawcett, and Jonathan Silverman(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A hotshot detective who was killed in the line of duty joins a supernatural police force that protects the living from the malevolent souls who have escaped judgment in this adaptation of the popular Dark Horse comic book. Nick Walker (Ryan Reynolds) was a cop with a reputation for getting a results when he was brutally gunned down during a violent raid. The next thing Nick knew, he was sitting in the headquarters of the Rest in Peace Department -- a supernatural police force tasked with arresting lost souls who are hiding out on Earth. His new partner Roy Pulsifer (Jeff Bridges) is a veteran sheriff with a knack for spotting a fugitive soul in disguise. Now Roy and Nick are about to face a menace that threatens to upset the ethereal balance between the physical world and the supernatural realm, and should they fail in maintaining that balance Earth will be flooded with a wave of very angry -- and very powerful -- lost souls. Kevin Bacon, Mary-Louise Parker, and Stephanie Szostak co-star(n)</desc>

Arrested on charges of drug distribution after he's caught with a package of Ecstasy, 18-year-old Jason Collins (Rafi Gavron) faces a mandatory ten-year sentence in a federal prison. But Jason's father John (Dwayne Johnson) knows that his son is no drug dealer, and vows to do whatever it takes to win back his freedom. When Jason refuses an offer to reduce his sentence by setting someone up to take a big fall, John pleads with U.S. Attorney Joanne Keeghan (Susan Sarandon) to let him go undercover, and gather enough evidence to convict the real power players. With the help of ex-con-turned-family man Daniel (Jon Bernthal), John is hot on the trail of Malik (Michael Kenneth Williams), a vicious drug dealer and the leader of a notorious street gang. Meanwhile, in his efforts to free his son, John may have inadvertently put Daniel's family in jeopardy. Later, when the growing trail of clues leads John to ruthless cartel leader Juan Carlos "El Topo" Pintera (Benjamin Bratt), the loyal father vows not to let his fate be dictated by the ambitious powers that be on either side of the law.

    <title lang="en">Jumper</title>
    <desc lang="en">Following up his blockbuster action hit Mr. and Mrs. Smith, director Doug Liman turns to an entirely new genre -- sci-fi -- for this tale of an underground world of teleporters. Based on the novel by Steven Gould, Jumper concerns David (Hayden Christensen), a young man who quite literally wills himself away from his grim family life by teleporting to another place with the power of his mind. Years later, David is using his powers to raid bank vaults, seduce girls in London, lunch on the pyramids, and surf in Fiji. But he soon discovers that he is not the only one bestowed with this unique gift, and all is not well in the world of jumpers. There are people out there, such as Roland (Samuel L. Jackson), who view jumpers as a threat to all humankind, and have made it their mission in life to eliminate them. After jumping back to Michigan to get reacquainted with his long lost love, Millie (Rachel Bilson), David makes the acquaintance of experienced jumper Griffin (Jamie Bell). Informed by Griffin of a secret between jumpers and a shadowy group that seeks to destroy them, the pair soon finds themselves facing off against a legion of murderous opponents who won't stop fighting until every last jumper has been eliminated(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Abyss</title>
    <desc lang="en">Approved by director James Cameron, The Abyss - Special Edition is an extended director's cut of the 1989 underwater science fiction epic, reinstating nearly a half hour of footage removed from the original release under studio pressure. The plot remains the same: the crew of an experimental, high-tech submersible is called into action to investigate a mysterious nuclear submarine crash. A series of strange encounters leads the crew to suspect the accident was caused by an extraterrestrial craft, and that they may be participating in an encounter with an alien species. However, in order to make contact, they must not only brave the abyss, an exceedingly deep underwater canyon, but also deal with the violent actions of one of their own crew members, an increasingly paranoid Navy SEAL officer. Much of the restored footage places these events in a grander political context, as the crew's mission becomes a factor in the dangerous escalation of nuclear tension between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The largest change involves the film's ending, which provides further information on the aliens' mission on Earth, bringing the film to closer to Cameron's intention: a modern remake of Robert Wise's The Day the Earth Stood Still(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Shattered</title>
    <desc lang="en">A sociopathic kidnapper methodically pushes a desperate pair of parents to their absolute breaking point in this thriller starring Piece Brosnan, Gerard Butler, and Maria Bello. Life has been good to happily married Chicago couple Neil (Butler) and Abby (Bello); their flames in their relationship are still burning bright, Neil has a great job, and with the birth of their beautiful daughter Sophie the loving couple has grown into a budding family. So much can change in an instant though, and the moment that sadistic kidnapper Ryan (Brosnan) appears the fibers of this happy family are torn violently apart. Ryan knows everything there is to know about Neil, Abby, and Sophie, and now he's ready to use that information to put the two parents through the most excruciating experience of their entire lives. Should Neil and Abby not comply with Ryan's every demand over the course of the next twenty-four hours, he will kill young Sophie without a second thought. While at first the demands seem typical of your average kidnapper, they gradually begin to grow increasingly outlandish until it becomes obvious that Ryan doesn't want money, but simply enjoys the power that comes along with systematically dismantling their idyllic lives until there's nothing left for Neil and Abby to live for. Now left with nothing to lose, the monstrous Ryan finds out just how far a parent is willing to go in order to save their child when he commands Neil to commit one final act of annihilation that goes against everything the loving father and husband stands for(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In this historical drama, idealistic German public prosecutor Johann Radmann (Alexander Fehling) becomes interested in the case of Charles Schulz, a former Nazi officer at Auschwitz who is now a schoolteacher. Radmann initially encounters resistance from the rest of his department when he begins his investigation, but senior prosecutor Walter Friedberg (Robert Hunger-Buhler) ultimately allows him to build as many cases as possible against the 8000 people who worked at the death camp. Helmed by first-time feature-film director Giulio Ricciarelli, Labyrinth of Lies is based on the Frankfurt Auschwitz trials, a previously lesser-known chapter of Germany's post-WWII history in which the country was forced to reckon with the Nazis who returned to everyday life following the end of the war.

    <desc lang="en">Two college students heading home for the holidays break down on a lonesome stretch of highway, only to find themselves targeted by the malevolent spirits of other travelers who met their end on the same road in a supernatural road movie directed by Greg Jacobs, and produced by Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney. All she (Emily Blunt) wanted was to make it back home to Delaware for the holidays. Though her classmate (Ashton Holmes) has a working car and is happy to oblige by offering a ride, it quickly becomes apparent that the boy has been admiring her from afar for the entire semester. After hours of traveling on the lonesome snow swept roads, an ill-advised shortcut finds the young pair side swiped by a speeding car and hopelessly stuck in a massive snow bank. Now stranded in a cell-phone dead zone with nothing to eat and no heat, the pair gradually begins to suspect that they're not alone in this beautiful but foreboding landscape. After a run-in with a malevolent cop (Martin Donovan) provides little hope for rescue, a series of frightening apparitions begin to emerge from the chilly surroundings to suggest that these two students weren't the first to face a life or death struggle on this treacherous stretch of road(n)</desc>

Though the maniacal driver himself always comes out relatively unscathed, the same certainly can't be said for the poor young lass in his passenger seat -- or anyone unfortunate enough to be on the road when the urge to kill strikes for that matter. With a list of potential road-kill candidates that includes Rose McGowan, Jordan Ladd, Rosario Dawson, and Vanessa Ferlito, Death Proof takes viewers on an adrenaline-infused drive that's as sexy as it is shocking(n)</desc>

Alongside Carr, Ginsberg manages to strike up friendships with aspiring writers William S. Burroughs (Ben Foster) and Jack Kerouac (Jack Huston) that would cast conformity to the wind, and serve as the foundation of the Beat movement. Meanwhile, an older outsider named David Kammerer falls deeply and madly in love with the impossibly cool Carr. Later, when Kammerer dies under mysterious circumstances, police arrest Kerouac, Burroughs, and Carr as potential suspects, paving the way for an investigation that would have a major impact on the lives of the three emerging artists.

    <desc lang="en">Ryuhei Kitamura, director of The Midnight Meat Train, delivers this twisting tale of terror concerning a missing heiress, a gang of vicious bandits, and a vacationing couple who aren't what they seem. In the wake of a bloodbath that left 14 students dead, wealthy heiress Emma (Adelaide Clemens) has vanished without a trace. A few months later, a young couple (Luke Evans and Laura Ramsey) cross paths with the ruthless Hoag (Lee Tergesen) and his band of thieves, who run them off of the road in a violent robbery attempt.

Tim Blake Nelson portrays the patriarch, a boozy lawyer who oversees the lives of his children with cynical monologues delivered through an alcoholic haze. Quentin, the oldest child, goes to Harvard, but he's very close with Caddy, the only daughter in the family who has a child out of wedlock. Second son Jason attempts to rule the family with an iron fist, but he's full of resentment towards Caddy's bastard child. All of them attempt to care for the developmentally disabled Benjy (Franco). Franco employs a fractured approach to the narrative in an attempt to capture Faulkner's distinctive prose style.

    <title lang="en">Trainspotting</title>
    <desc lang="en">A controversial, blackly comic view of the life of heroin addict Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor) and the group of junkies, deadbeats, thieves, liars, and psychopaths who he calls friends. Renton is a clever, witty anit-hero, who consciously chooses the life of a junkie over the utter boredom of everything else. While getting the squalor and degradation of the junkie lifestyle down to the last grotesque detail, Trainspotting also captures the way drugs give structure and meaning to otherwise aimless lives, and describes, in detail, the breathtaking rapture of a fix. Director Danny Boyle shows himself to be a unique talent, in this stunning and at times revolting follow-up to his earlier success Shallow Grave. Much of the success of the film is due to the performance of Ewan McGregor, who is both charming and repellant in the role of Mark. McGregor deftly plays the unrepentant Mark as he tells his story, and shows the same comic flair that he did in Shallow Grave. Danny Boyle challenges his audience as Mark explains his chosen lifestyle, but does not apologize for it, and it is this nonjudgmental stance that gives the film its power. The audience is asked neither to approve of Mark nor to emulate him. Boyle simply tells Mark's story, brutal, funny and loathsome as it can be, leaving the moralizing to be done by others(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Picture Perfect</title>
    <desc lang="en">Television actress Jennifer Anniston makes her feature-film debut in a starring role as Kate, a bright but mousey and single young advertising executive seeking to climb the corporate ladder. But though she has all the right qualifications professionally, Kate has a problem in her boss's eyes: she's single. In his opinion, only married and henceforth deeply indebted people should be on the fast track for promotions because they have more motivation to remain loyal to a company. Desperate to ascend, Kate follows overenthusiastic colleague Darcy's (Illeana Douglas) bad advice and fabricates a fabulous fiance. Kate's other motivation for inventing a lover is to capture the attentions of the office Lothario, Sam (Kevin Bacon), a lean, sexy guy who thinks Kate is too good to warrant his bad-boy affections. For her dream fiance, Kate chooses handsome, heroic wedding-photographer Nick (Jay Mohr), whom she recently met at a friend's marriage in Boston. Not realizing that Nick is secretly in love with her, Kate offers him $1,000 to pretend to be her intended and to break up with her during an important business dinner. Meanwhile, Sam, upon learning that Kate is a taken women, launches a successful seduction campaign. With everything finally going her way, Kate couldn't be happier. But when Nick finally arrives, her careful plans begin to go spectacularly awry, and she is forced to face the truth about her feelings for the sneaky Sam and the patient, knightly Nick. Picture Perfect is an average-quality romantic comedy, one that would work especially on television. Anniston does well in her role as the confused Kate, exuding an off-beat beauty, considerable charm and a calculated comic timing, but whether or not she has the chops to make it as a movie star remains to be seen. Her co-star Mohr (Tom Cruise's slimy rival in Jerry Maguire) is more natural and charismatic. Though more low-key than the tightly-wound Anniston, he managed to steal most of the scenes in which he appeared(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Bowfinger</title>
    <desc lang="en">A group of wanna-be filmmakers and actors concocts a scheme to make a movie with a major star without having to pay him in this comedy. Bobby Bowfinger (Steve Martin) has struggled for years to make it in Hollywood with no real success; he's convinced that he has to make his big break soon or it will be too late. Bobby has a script, and he has a cast, including an ingenue straight off the bus from Ohio (Heather Graham), a one-time regional stage star who fondly recalls her brief moment of glory (Christine Baranski), and a hunky aspiring matinee idol (Kohl Sudduth). He also has a young associate named Dave (Jamie Kennedy), who has a low-level job at a movie studio as a gofer -- which means that he has keys to every part of the lot and can "borrow" whatever they need. All they need is a star, but without any money, how do they get one? Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy) is a leading action star, and he is obviously beyond Bowfinger's budget. But Bobby has an idea: what if he tricked Kit into appearing in the film without his knowing it? Steve Martin also wrote the film's screenplay, and former Muppets performer Frank Oz directs(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Smoke</title>
    <desc lang="en">This ensemble drama centers on a neighborhood cigar store as it chronicles the entangled lives of fifteen characters. The story is divided into five chapters each bearing the name of a different character. The main players have roles in all five stories. The first, "Paul" follows recently widowed novelist Paul Benjamin whose wife died during a bank robbery. He is almost hit by a truck when a black teenager who calls himself Rashid, saves him. The thankful novelist lets the teen stay with him for a while. Rashid's story forms the basis of chapter two. Paul is visited by Rashid's aunt who tells him that the boys true name is Thomas Cole. He has recently learned that his dad is really alive and living out of the city. Rashid journeys to meet his dad, Cyrus Cole. When he meets him, Rashid tells him his name is Paul Benjamin. Auggie, the cigar store manager, also gets a surprise when his ex-wife shows up to tell him his daughter is a pregnant drug addict. Rashid tells Paul that he has $6000, the spoils of a recent bank robbery perpetrated by his pal, Creeper. The rest of the chapters are equally convoluted(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Bowfinger</title>
    <desc lang="en">A group of wanna-be filmmakers and actors concocts a scheme to make a movie with a major star without having to pay him in this comedy. Bobby Bowfinger (Steve Martin) has struggled for years to make it in Hollywood with no real success; he's convinced that he has to make his big break soon or it will be too late. Bobby has a script, and he has a cast, including an ingenue straight off the bus from Ohio (Heather Graham), a one-time regional stage star who fondly recalls her brief moment of glory (Christine Baranski), and a hunky aspiring matinee idol (Kohl Sudduth). He also has a young associate named Dave (Jamie Kennedy), who has a low-level job at a movie studio as a gofer -- which means that he has keys to every part of the lot and can "borrow" whatever they need. All they need is a star, but without any money, how do they get one? Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy) is a leading action star, and he is obviously beyond Bowfinger's budget. But Bobby has an idea: what if he tricked Kit into appearing in the film without his knowing it? Steve Martin also wrote the film's screenplay, and former Muppets performer Frank Oz directs(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Grindhouse</title>
    <desc lang="en">Kill Bill director Quentin Tarantino and Sin City director Robert Rodriguez join forces to offer a cinematic tribute to the blood-soaked exploitation epics of yesteryear with this hyper-violent coupling of two full-length features punctuated by a collection of outrageous trailers. The first segment, directed by Rodriguez and entitled Planet Terror, details the violent struggle between a ravenous army of zombie-like humanoids who have taken control of the planet and the remaining survivors who refuse to go down without a fight. Freddy Rodriguez, Naveen Andrews, and Rose McGowan headline a cast that also includes Marley Shelton, Michael Biehn, Josh Brolin, Bruce Willis, and Tom Savini. In Death Proof -- director Tarantino's take on such peddle-to-the-metal shockers as White Line Fever -- Kurt Russell stars as an engine-revving psychopath who prefers to take out his beautiful victims at 200 mph. With a list of potential roadkill candidates that includes Rose McGowan, Jordan Ladd, Rosario Dawson, and Vanessa Ferlito, Death Proof takes viewers on an adrenaline-infused drive that's as sexy as it is shocking. Its tantalizing title borrowed from the term frequently used to describe the seedy, 1970s-era inner-city movie theaters that screened excessive, low-budget independent films containing copious amounts of violence and nudity as a means of offering counter-programming to the decidedly more restrained big-budget studio films, Grindhouse takes its love for these unabashedly sleazy efforts one step further by offering a jaw-dropping collection of fake exploitation trailers from such directors as Rob Zombie, Eli Roth, and Edgar Wright(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Pure Luck</title>
    <desc lang="en">This wacky buddy comedy was the fifth in a series of Hollywood remakes of films by French director Francis Veber, none of which were box office successes. Sheila Kelley is Valerie Highsmith, an heiress who, despite her family's wealth, suffers from horribly bad luck. On a vacation to Mexico, she takes a fall, causing amnesia, then is mugged and kidnapped for ransom. When her father (Sam Wanamaker) becomes frustrated with the failed attempts of a detective, Ray Campanella (Danny Glover) to find his daughter, he teams a very reluctant Ray with Eugene Proctor (Martin Short), an accountant whose bumbling bad luck is even worse than Valerie's. The theory is that perhaps two such incredibly unlucky people will act like magnets, with Eugene leading Ray to Valerie's location. Although Ray finds Eugene irritating, the unlikely partners eventually begin making surprising progress in the case, despite Eugene's never-ending screw-ups and pratfalls(n)</desc>

The Nanomite threat has been neutralized, and the U.S. government has imprisoned Cobra Commander and Destro in an inescapable subterranean prison. When the leader of Pakistan is assassinated, the U.S. president (Jonathan Pryce) calls on the Joes to secure Pakistan's nuclear warheads before they fall into enemy hands. In the wake of successfully completing their mission, however, the Joes are decimated in a devastating surprise attack. When the smoke clears, Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson), Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki), and Flint (D.J. Cotrona) are the sole survivors. They're convinced that something is amiss in the White House, and as Lady Jaye theorizes that an imposter is pretending to be the commander in chief, bad guys Storm Shadow (Lee Byung-hun) and Firefly (Ray Stevenson) team up to break Cobra Commander (Luke Bracey) out of prison. Later, as Storm Shadow retreats into the mountains to recover from burns incurred in the extraction, Snake Eyes (Ray Park) and Jinx (Elodie Yung) manage to capture the elusive white ninja, in the process discovering a shocking secret about his past and learning that Zartan (Arnold Vosloo), posing as the president, has called an international summit to discuss nuclear disarmament in order to bring the leaders of the world to their knees before the diabolical Cobra Commander. Now, as Cobra holds the entire globe hostage with a revolutionary new weapon placed on satellites orbiting the planet, it's up to the Joes and a trustworthy old friend to save the day(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A thwarted leprechaun exacts his bloody revenge in this darkly comic horror film. A thousand years ago in Ancient Erin, there lived a wee Leprechaun who searched for a comely bride. Legend has it that his proper bride would thrice sneeze. Poor Leprechaun did find his sneezing lass, but just before the third achoo, her daddy, the Leprechaun's slave, thwarts his plans. Angry, the wee man vows to exact his revenge upon the man's fairest ancestor 1,000 years hence. Time flies and the movie moves to modern California on St. Paddy's day. The Leprechaun returns to find the lovely Bridget sneezing. Once. Twice. Thrice. He captures hapless Colleen. To her rescue comes her fearless boyfriend Cody who steals a bit of gold from the Leprechaun. Enraged, the greedy greeny begins systematically killing people. Will Cody prevail?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Joes reteam to prevent Cobra from achieving total world domination in this sequel that picks up shortly after the events of G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra. The Nanomite threat has been neutralized, and the U.S. government has imprisoned Cobra Commander and Destro in an inescapable subterranean prison. When the leader of Pakistan is assassinated, the U.S. president (Jonathan Pryce) calls on the Joes to secure Pakistan's nuclear warheads before they fall into enemy hands. In the wake of successfully completing their mission, however, the Joes are decimated in a devastating surprise attack. When the smoke clears, Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson), Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki), and Flint (D.J. Cotrona) are the sole survivors. They're convinced that something is amiss in the White House, and as Lady Jaye theorizes that an imposter is pretending to be the commander in chief, bad guys Storm Shadow (Lee Byung-hun) and Firefly (Ray Stevenson) team up to break Cobra Commander (Luke Bracey) out of prison. Later, as Storm Shadow retreats into the mountains to recover from burns incurred in the extraction, Snake Eyes (Ray Park) and Jinx (Elodie Yung) manage to capture the elusive white ninja, in the process discovering a shocking secret about his past and learning that Zartan (Arnold Vosloo), posing as the president, has called an international summit to discuss nuclear disarmament in order to bring the leaders of the world to their knees before the diabolical Cobra Commander. Now, as Cobra holds the entire globe hostage with a revolutionary new weapon placed on satellites orbiting the planet, it's up to the Joes and a trustworthy old friend to save the day(n)</desc>
