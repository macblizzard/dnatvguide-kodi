Plus, an acrimonious divorce in Chessington comes to a head when the estranged wife obtains a writ to reclaim the house, and an off-licence owner in Hampshire with unpaid rent of more than £5,000 battles to keep his business open just as everything shuts down for the holidays.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Joe Darrow works as a doctor in the emergency room of Chicago Memorial Hospital. His wife, Emily Darrow, was last seen in a rainstorm in Venezuela, where she was on a retreat with the Red Cross offering humanitarian aid. She vanished in a bus accident. There were no survivors and her body was never found. That rich, green, exotic land is left behind as Joe is challenged to persevere through sad, rainy days back home. Joe promised Emily that if anything ever happened to her, he would visit her patients in the oncology ward. Strangely, the children seem to know him, and they say they've seen Emily in their near-death experiences. Joe starts to believe that his wife is using the near-death experiences of her terminal patients to communicate with him, through images the children report seeing in their dreams, and symbols they are inexplicably compelled to draw. While the children see Joe as a kindred spirit, the hospital staff worries about how these interactions are agitating them. At home, Joe begins finding other ethereal evidence of his wife's attempt to contact him from beyond the grave, some of it featuring the image of a dragonfly, which was the shape of the birthmark on her shoulder. His friends and a caring neighbor (Kathy Bates) worry that Joe is losing his marbles, especially as his quest becomes more frantic, putting his job in jeopardy(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Dead Poets Society</title>
    <desc lang="en">Robin Williams toned down his usually manic comic approach in this successful period drama. In 1959, the Welton Academy is a staid but well-respected prep school where education is a pragmatic and rather dull affair. Several of the students, however, have their thoughts on the learning process (and life itself) changed when a new teacher comes to the school. John Keating (Williams) is an unconventional educator who tears chapters of his textbooks and asks his students to stand on their desks to see the world from a new angle. Keating introduces his students to poetry, and his free-thinking attitude and the liberating philosophies of the authors he introduces to his class have a profound effect on his students, especially Todd (Ethan Hawke), who would like to be a writer; Neil ( Robert Sean Leonard), who dreams of being an actor, despite the objections of his father; Knox (Josh Charles), a hopeless romantic; Steven (Allelon Ruggiero), an intellectual who learns to use his heart as well as his head; Charlie (Gale Hansen), who begins to lose his blasé attitude; unconventional Gerard (James Waterston); and practical Richard (Dylan Kussman). Keating urges his students to seize the day and live their lives boldly; but when this philosophy leads to an unexpected tragedy, headmaster Mr. Nolan (Norman Lloyd) fires Keating, and his students leap to his defense.

Although disheartened, Austin also travels in time and discovers that the criminal now has new allies -such as the dwarf clone, Mini-Mim (Verne Troyer) and the repugnant Igor Dan (once again, Myers). With the help of the beautiful agent, Felicity Fasobem (Heather Graham), Austin must strive to defeat the enemy and recover his vitality.

The two things the people of this posh town treasure most are their children and their cheeses; unfortunately, those are also the things that the Boxtrools - a race of unsightly, sewer-dwelling creatures - covet most. Clad in cast-off cardboard boxes as they scuttle about underground, the Boxtrolls may look like a fearsome bunch, they're actually quite friendly. Having previously adopted an orphaned infant named Eggs (voiced by Isaac Hempstead-Wright), the diminutive tinkerers raise him as one of their own. Meanwhile, Eggs may be the Boxtrolls' only hope for survival when scheming exterminator Archibald Snatcher (voiced by Oscar-winner Ben Kingsley) seeks to earn his entry into the ultra-exclusive Cheesebridge society by eradicating the misunderstood creatures once and for all. Little does the villainous Snatcher realize that Eggs has a wealthy friend named Winnie (voiced by Ellie Fanning), and that Winnie may be the key to solving the longstanding feud between the people above, and the benevolent creatures below(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Death Race</title>
    <desc lang="en">The Transporter star Jason Statham takes the wheel in director Paul W.S. Anderson's remake of the Roger Corman classic about a hyper-violent cross-country race that breaks all of the traditional rules of the road. The time is the not-so-distant future, and as America's prisons begin overflowing with violent criminals, the powers that be devise a grisly game that will free up space in the cells and entertain the masses at the same time. Jensen Ames (Statham) is a three-time speedway champion with a dark past. A survival expert and ex-con whose sordid history comes back to haunt him when he is framed for a murder he didn't commit, Ames is forced to choose between donning the metallic mask of a mythical racer known as Frankenstein or languishing away on Terminal Island -- America's most notorious penitentiary. Over the course of the next three days, this unlikely champion will get behind the wheel of a nightmare machine outfitted with machine guns, grenade launchers, and flamethrowers in a desperate attempt to outrun some of the most violent criminals ever imprisoned. Should Ames be the first to cross the checkered flag, he will win his freedom; should he come in second, however, death would be preferable to a grim future in a cramped concrete cell. Co-stars include Joan Allen, Ian McShane, Natalie Martinez, and Tyrese Gibson, who takes over the role of Machine Gun Joe, made famous by Sylvester Stallone in the original(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Story of Funk: One Nation Under a Groove</title>
    <desc lang="en">Documentary examining the history of funk, starting from its birth in the black community at a time of self-discovery, struggle and social change. The fun style of the music changed the streets of the US in the seventies with new trends in fashion and slang emerging, and its celebration of African-American culture. The genre produced some of the most famous acts in the world, such as James Brown, Sly &amp; the Family Stone, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, and Kool &amp; the Gang. Including interviews with George Clinton, Ray Parker Jr and trombonist Fred Wesley.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Music for Misfits: The Story of Indie</title>
    <sub-title lang="en">The Alternative 80s.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">During the 1980s, independent record labels transformed from cottage industries into real businesses that could compete with the majors. This documentary recalls the first cross-over of alternative music into the mainstream chart, as well as the emergence of fanzines, whereby aspiring music journalists could access their favourite indie stars at the small and intimate gigs where they performed. Narrator Mark Radcliffe also considers the latter part of the decade when the emerging acid house rave culture spawned a new crop of bands such as the Stone Roses and Happy Mondays. Contributors include Stephen Morris, Gillian Gilbert, James Dean Bradfield and Shaun Ryder.(n)</desc>

In the village of Countesthorpe, recently divorced Elaine wants to move on from her family home, but the former police officer can't see why its tired and dated look is putting buyers off.(n)</desc>

Lee Mack, Sally Bretton and Katy Wix star in this festive special of the sitcom, with Bobby Ball, Geoffrey Whitehead and Deborah Grant. Festive edition from 2013.(n)</desc>

Jeremy Clarkson chooses a Volkswagen Up for the journey, while Richard Hammond takes a Ford Fiesta and James May opts for a Dacia Sandero. On their adventure, the trio absorb the history of the Crimean Peninsula, including a visit to an old submarine pen - but the carefree exploration looks likely to become a chore when Jeremy, Richard and James are challenged to a long drive north through the expansive country, during which they must combat serious boredom. And as if that wasn't arduous enough, a new task is set when they arrive in Kiev - a trip into the wasteland of Chernobyl.

Meanwhile, Jeremy - who has promised to change his name to Jennifer if the Porsche is faster around the test track than the McLaren P1 driven earlier in the series - compares the seventh-generation Volkswagen Golf GTI to BMW's critically acclaimed M135i.

    <title lang="en">Atlantic: The Wildest Ocean on Earth</title>
    <sub-title lang="en">Atlantic: Mountains of the Deep.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Documentary examining the animals pitting themselves against the world's wildest ocean, unveiling the natural forces that underpin life in the Atlantic. In the vast South Atlantic, huge pods of dolphins, massive penguin colonies and the largest gathering of marine mammals on Earth pack chains of extraordinary islands, created by powerful volcanic forces far below them. Meanwhile, the nutrient-rich upwellings create profusions of life in some areas, and the abyssal depths host a world of bizarre creatures in others.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">David Attenborough observes the wildlife of the desert-like west and south of the island, an area where dry spells can last months and survival is a struggle. Verreaux's sifakas live among trees with potentially lethal spikes, while the baobab trees house mouse lemurs, primates that feed on the droppings of fluffy bugs. During the toughest time of year, gangs of ring-tailed lemurs try to raise their young, and as the rains arrive, the year-long life cycle of the Labord's chameleon begins.(n)</desc>

And when a Coastguard boat appears on the scene, things get even worse for her in director Bruce Beresford's revenge thriller. Libby is imprisoned for his murder on the circumstantial evidence - which also includes a massive death insurance payout - and her best friend, Angie, steps in to look after Libby's young son, Matty. But, speaking to Angie on the phone one day, Libby hears Matty say 'Hello Daddy... ' in the background and puts two and two together: she's been framed by her closest friends. Unfortunately for them, Libby discovers that once someone's been convicted of a crime, they can't be tried for it again. So she's got nothing to lose, and if she can get out of jail, she can make the pair pay the ultimate price for their treachery. Also starring Tommy Lee Jones(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Layer Cake</title>
    <desc lang="en">Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels producer Matthew Vaughn kicked off his directorial career with this crime thriller starring Daniel Craig, Sienna Miller and Michael Gambon. Craig plays an unnamed gentleman drug dealer (well, all things are relative in his line of work) who, landed with an astonishingly lucrative job, spies his opportunity to retire relatively unscathed from the business. However, before he can do so, his boss Jimmy Price asks him to track down the missing daughter of another gangster, Eddie Temple, and as Temple's of an even nastier temperament than Price it's not a request he can easily refuse. And once he embarks on his task, complications begin to stack upon each other in much the manner of the confection that gives the film its title - though rather than some lovely sponge, cream and berries, this one consists of brutal henchmen, drug deals gone bad and violent bloodletting(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis star in Seth MacFarlane's irreverent and vulgar comedy-drama about the relationship between a man, a woman and the man's toy bear. The young John Bennett had such an unpleasant and lonely childhood that he wished his soft toy, Teddy, would come alive and be his friend. And to everyone's surprise it did. The walking, talking and wisecracking plush creature became an overnight sensation - even appearing on The Johnny Carson Show. But fame being what it is, Teddy's time in the limelight ended. Now, Bennett is a directionless slacker in his 30s and still inseparable from Ted. They share a fondness for booze and pot, but the cynical bear has also developed his own distinctive sexual peccadillos, which he indulges with prostitutes (while harbouring a deep resentment that he wasn't made with anatomical correctness). However, Bennett's emotional loyalty towards Ted faces its biggest test yet, in the shape of Bennett's girlfriend Lori. She feels Bennett needs to grow up - and choose between her and Ted. Meanwhile, the bear must deal with a fan who's stalking him(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis star in Seth MacFarlane's irreverent and vulgar comedy-drama about the relationship between a man, a woman and the man's toy bear. The young John Bennett had such an unpleasant and lonely childhood that he wished his soft toy, Teddy, would come alive and be his friend. And to everyone's surprise it did. The walking, talking and wisecracking plush creature became an overnight sensation - even appearing on The Johnny Carson Show. But fame being what it is, Teddy's time in the limelight ended. Now, Bennett is a directionless slacker in his 30s and still inseparable from Ted. They share a fondness for booze and pot, but the cynical bear has also developed his own distinctive sexual peccadillos, which he indulges with prostitutes (while harbouring a deep resentment that he wasn't made with anatomical correctness). However, Bennett's emotional loyalty towards Ted faces its biggest test yet, in the shape of Bennett's girlfriend Lori. She feels Bennett needs to grow up - and choose between her and Ted. Meanwhile, the bear must deal with a fan who's stalking him(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish. One day, Bart Simpson (voice of Nancy Cartwright) is fishing along the river downstream from the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, and catches a strange three-eyed fish. A reporter happens to be passing by, and writes a story about the mutant fish; inspectors from the Nuclear Regulatory Committee soon arrive in town, and are outraged at the shoddy state of the plant. Mr. Burns (voice of Harry Shearer) attempts to bribe them, which only makes matters worse. Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) mentions in passing to Mr. Burns that if he were governor, he could change the state's laws regulating power plants and stay in business; Burns seizes upon the idea and runs for office. For the sake of his job, Homer finds himself helping Mr. Burns, while Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) and Lisa (voice of Yeardley Smith) both support the state's longtime governor, Mary Bailey. Near the end of his campaign swing, Mr. Burns persuades Homer to allow him to have dinner with his family the night before the election as a publicity stunt. Marge and Lisa are not at all happy to be helping Burns in his bid for the governorship, but Marge has a secret plan to derail the Burns campaign. "Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish" first aired on November 1, 1990(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Determined to grow as both a human being and an artist, hip-hop icon Snoop Dogg takes a spiritual pilgrimage to Jamaica as filmmaker Andy Capper captures his gradual metamorphosis into Snoop Lion over the course of one profoundly transformational month. For as long as Snoop can remember, he's been rapping, but upon turning 41, the hustler lifestyle begins to take its toll on the man who turned out such hits as "Murder Was the Case," and who has seen the lives of too many friends taken by violence. While visiting Trench Town, Snoop seeks the wisdom of the Nyabinghi community elders in finding a new direction, and reflects on the past and future while immersing himself in Rastafarian culture. Later, in the wake of a deeply affecting meeting with the legendary Bunny Wailer, Snoop Dogg embraces his new identity as Snoop Lion(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">P.S. I Love You</title>
    <desc lang="en">A grieving widow finds her husband's warmth radiating from the afterlife when she discovers that he left her a series of tasks to be revealed in ten monthly messages and designed to help her overcome her sorrow while gradually making the transition into a new life. Holly Kennedy (Hilary Swank) is a New York real estate broker whose good-humored husband, Irishman Gerry (Gerard Butler), always stood by her side. Suddenly, and seemingly out of nowhere, Gerry succumbs to a brain tumor and Holly is left to face an uncertain future. No one in the world knows Holly better than Gerry, not even her mother (Kathy Bates) or her best friends, Sharon (Gina Gershon) and Denise (Lisa Kudrow). But while Holly remains unsure if she can go on without the love of her life to help guide her, Gerry has planned ahead. On Holly's 30th birthday, she receives a cake and a special tape recording from Gerry that implores her to get out and celebrate instead of staying in and mourning. Later, as the months wear on, a series of additional messages arrive from Gerry -- always delivered in the most remarkable and surprising of ways. With each new message comes a new adventure, and each letter signs off in the same familiar way: "P.S. I love you." Despite the fact that Holly's mother and friends think these humorous, posthumous messages are keeping Holly bound to the past, the truth is that they are lovingly guiding her into the future while proving that sometimes death isn't just the end, but a new beginning as well. Director Richard LaGravenese teams with screenwriter Steve Rogers to adapt author Cecelia Ahern's best-selling novel(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Speed Racer</title>
    <desc lang="en">The Matrix masterminds Andy and Larry Wachowski usher anime icon Tatsuo Yoshida's classic 1960s-era hit into the new millennium with this family-friendly story of a young racecar driver who takes on the mysterious Racer X in a custom-made, gadget-loaded speed machine named the Mach 5. Speed Racer (Emile Hirsch) is the kind of driver that every wheelman wishes he could be: a born winner whose unbeatable combination of aggression, instinct, and fearlessness always finds him crossing the checkered flag with a comfortable lead. In Speed Racer's mind, the only driver who could present him with any real challenge is his late brother -- the legendary Rex Racer. Rex died in a heated cross-country rally known as The Crucible many years ago, and now his younger sibling is driven to fulfill the legacy that Rex left behind. To this day, Speed Racer is fiercely loyal to family. It was Speed Racer's father, Pops Racer (John Goodman), who designed the unbeatable Mach 5, and even a lucrative offer from racing giants Royalton Industries isn't enough to get the young ace to break his family ties. Upon turning down Royalton's (Roger Allam) astronomical offer, Speed Racer makes the shocking discovery that the outcomes of the biggest races are being predetermined by a handful of powerful moguls who pad their profits by manipulating the drivers. Realizing that his career would be ruined if word of the fix gets out, Royalton vows that the Mach 5 will never make it to another finish line. Now, the only way for Speed Racer to save the family business and beat Royalton at his own game will be to win the very same race that claimed his brother's life so many years ago. In order to accomplish that formidable feat, however, Speed Racer will not only have to rely on his family and the aid of his longtime girlfriend, Trixie (Christina Ricci), but form a tenuous alliance with his longtime rival -- the mysterious Racer X (Matthew Fox) -- as well(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Longing to discover the identity of her true father before she exchanges her wedding vows, the daughter of a once-rebellious single mother secretly invites a trio of paternal candidates to her upcoming wedding in this feature adaptation of the beloved stage musical. Independent-minded single mother Donna (Meryl Streep) has always done her best to raise her spirited daughter, Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), while simultaneously running a successful hotel on a small Greek island, but now the time has come for this hardworking mom to finally let go. In just a few days, Sophie will be married, and Donna will stand by bittersweetly as her little girl takes flight. Of course, Donna's lifelong friends Rosie (Julie Walters) and Tanya (Christine Baranski) will both be present at the wedding, but unbeknownst to the mother, Sophie has furtively invited three very special guests of her own. When Sophie walks down the aisle on that fateful day, she wants her father to hand her off. The only problem is that Donna has never revealed the true identity of Sophie's father, leaving the resourceful future bride to narrow the list down to three potential candidates. Now, as three key figures from Donna's past return to the picturesque Mediterranean shores they all walked 20 years prior, one beautiful bride will discover the secret of her past while one lonely mother finds out that it's never too late for a little romance. Phyllida Lloyd, director of both the original London sensation as well as the hit Broadway incarnation, makes her feature directorial debut with this big-screen version of the beloved musical featuring 22 classic ABBA hits.

    <desc lang="en">A grieving widow finds her husband's warmth radiating from the afterlife when she discovers that he left her a series of tasks to be revealed in ten monthly messages and designed to help her overcome her sorrow while gradually making the transition into a new life. Holly Kennedy (Hilary Swank) is a New York real estate broker whose good-humored husband, Irishman Gerry (Gerard Butler), always stood by her side. Suddenly, and seemingly out of nowhere, Gerry succumbs to a brain tumor and Holly is left to face an uncertain future. No one in the world knows Holly better than Gerry, not even her mother (Kathy Bates) or her best friends, Sharon (Gina Gershon) and Denise (Lisa Kudrow). But while Holly remains unsure if she can go on without the love of her life to help guide her, Gerry has planned ahead. On Holly's 30th birthday, she receives a cake and a special tape recording from Gerry that implores her to get out and celebrate instead of staying in and mourning. Later, as the months wear on, a series of additional messages arrive from Gerry -- always delivered in the most remarkable and surprising of ways. With each new message comes a new adventure, and each letter signs off in the same familiar way: "P.S. I love you." Despite the fact that Holly's mother and friends think these humorous, posthumous messages are keeping Holly bound to the past, the truth is that they are lovingly guiding her into the future while proving that sometimes death isn't just the end, but a new beginning as well. Director Richard LaGravenese teams with screenwriter Steve Rogers to adapt author Cecelia Ahern's best-selling novel(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Speed Racer</title>
    <desc lang="en">The Matrix masterminds Andy and Larry Wachowski usher anime icon Tatsuo Yoshida's classic 1960s-era hit into the new millennium with this family-friendly story of a young racecar driver who takes on the mysterious Racer X in a custom-made, gadget-loaded speed machine named the Mach 5. Speed Racer (Emile Hirsch) is the kind of driver that every wheelman wishes he could be: a born winner whose unbeatable combination of aggression, instinct, and fearlessness always finds him crossing the checkered flag with a comfortable lead. In Speed Racer's mind, the only driver who could present him with any real challenge is his late brother -- the legendary Rex Racer. Rex died in a heated cross-country rally known as The Crucible many years ago, and now his younger sibling is driven to fulfill the legacy that Rex left behind. To this day, Speed Racer is fiercely loyal to family. It was Speed Racer's father, Pops Racer (John Goodman), who designed the unbeatable Mach 5, and even a lucrative offer from racing giants Royalton Industries isn't enough to get the young ace to break his family ties. Upon turning down Royalton's (Roger Allam) astronomical offer, Speed Racer makes the shocking discovery that the outcomes of the biggest races are being predetermined by a handful of powerful moguls who pad their profits by manipulating the drivers. Realizing that his career would be ruined if word of the fix gets out, Royalton vows that the Mach 5 will never make it to another finish line. Now, the only way for Speed Racer to save the family business and beat Royalton at his own game will be to win the very same race that claimed his brother's life so many years ago. In order to accomplish that formidable feat, however, Speed Racer will not only have to rely on his family and the aid of his longtime girlfriend, Trixie (Christina Ricci), but form a tenuous alliance with his longtime rival -- the mysterious Racer X (Matthew Fox) -- as well(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Longing to discover the identity of her true father before she exchanges her wedding vows, the daughter of a once-rebellious single mother secretly invites a trio of paternal candidates to her upcoming wedding in this feature adaptation of the beloved stage musical. Independent-minded single mother Donna (Meryl Streep) has always done her best to raise her spirited daughter, Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), while simultaneously running a successful hotel on a small Greek island, but now the time has come for this hardworking mom to finally let go. In just a few days, Sophie will be married, and Donna will stand by bittersweetly as her little girl takes flight. Of course, Donna's lifelong friends Rosie (Julie Walters) and Tanya (Christine Baranski) will both be present at the wedding, but unbeknownst to the mother, Sophie has furtively invited three very special guests of her own. When Sophie walks down the aisle on that fateful day, she wants her father to hand her off. The only problem is that Donna has never revealed the true identity of Sophie's father, leaving the resourceful future bride to narrow the list down to three potential candidates. Now, as three key figures from Donna's past return to the picturesque Mediterranean shores they all walked 20 years prior, one beautiful bride will discover the secret of her past while one lonely mother finds out that it's never too late for a little romance. Phyllida Lloyd, director of both the original London sensation as well as the hit Broadway incarnation, makes her feature directorial debut with this big-screen version of the beloved musical featuring 22 classic ABBA hits.

    <title lang="en">American Psycho</title>
    <desc lang="en">Bret Easton Ellis's dark and violent satire of America in the 1980s is brought to the screen in this unsettling drama with blackly comic overtones. Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), the son of a wealthy Wall Street financier, is pursuing his own lucrative career with his father's firm. Bateman is the prototypical yuppie, obsessed with success, fashion, and style. He is also a serial killer who murders, rapes, and mutilates both strangers and acquaintances without provocation or reason. Donald Kimble (Willem Dafoe), a police detective, questions Bateman about the disappearance of Paul Allen (Jared Leto), whom Patrick murdered several days earlier. As Kimble stays on Bateman's trail, Bateman's mask of studied, distant cool begins to fall apart. American Psycho also features Reese Witherspoon as Bateman's girlfriend, as well as Samantha Mathis, Chloe Sevigny, and Guinevere Turner; the latter also co-authored the screenplay. Controversy followed the production from the start, when speculation that Leonardo Di Caprio would play Bateman sparked concerns that he would lure preteens to an R-rated movie. Di Caprio soon bowed out of the project, and original leading man Bale was reinstated. Later, a group of Toronto residents attempted to block filming in that city after Canadian serial killer Paul Bernardo claimed that Ellis's novel inspired his murder spree(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">After decades of movies about college sports, the bands who take the field at halftime finally get their day in the sun in this musical comedy drama. Devon Miles (Nick Cannon) is a talented young percussionist from Harlem who wins a music scholarship to Atlanta A &amp; T, a prestigious African-American university. For years, Atlanta A &amp; T has won awards for their show-style marching band, who combine expert musicianship (incorporating funk, R&amp;B, and jazz rhythms into the traditional marching band repertoire) with choreography, dancing cheerleaders, and roof-raising showmanship. Dr. Aaron Lee (Orlando Jones), the school's band director, gives Devon a spot in the marching band's drumline, the heart and soul of a show-style band, but discovers Devon's previous musical education hardly meets his usual standard when he learns that his new drummer can't read music. Devon soon earns a reputation as a stubborn individualist within the band, not necessarily a good thing in an ensemble where a strictly unified performance is considers the ideal. Devon's cocksure attitude and streetwise style doesn't mesh very comfortably with Sean Taylor (Leonard Roberts), a disciplined senior who resents the presence of the upstart freshman in the drumline, and things become even less harmonious when Devon begins making a play for Laila (Zoe Saldana), a beautiful girl who is also being courted by Sean. Songwriter and record producer Dallas Austin, who has worked with Boyz II Men, TLC, and Pink, served as executive producer for Drumline, helped produce the film's musical score, and contributed his own experiences as a marching band member to the screenplay(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Longing to discover the identity of her true father before she exchanges her wedding vows, the daughter of a once-rebellious single mother secretly invites a trio of paternal candidates to her upcoming wedding in this feature adaptation of the beloved stage musical. Independent-minded single mother Donna (Meryl Streep) has always done her best to raise her spirited daughter, Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), while simultaneously running a successful hotel on a small Greek island, but now the time has come for this hardworking mom to finally let go. In just a few days, Sophie will be married, and Donna will stand by bittersweetly as her little girl takes flight. Of course, Donna's lifelong friends Rosie (Julie Walters) and Tanya (Christine Baranski) will both be present at the wedding, but unbeknownst to the mother, Sophie has furtively invited three very special guests of her own. When Sophie walks down the aisle on that fateful day, she wants her father to hand her off. The only problem is that Donna has never revealed the true identity of Sophie's father, leaving the resourceful future bride to narrow the list down to three potential candidates. Now, as three key figures from Donna's past return to the picturesque Mediterranean shores they all walked 20 years prior, one beautiful bride will discover the secret of her past while one lonely mother finds out that it's never too late for a little romance. Phyllida Lloyd, director of both the original London sensation as well as the hit Broadway incarnation, makes her feature directorial debut with this big-screen version of the beloved musical featuring 22 classic ABBA hits.

    <title lang="en">P.S. I Love You</title>
    <desc lang="en">A grieving widow finds her husband's warmth radiating from the afterlife when she discovers that he left her a series of tasks to be revealed in ten monthly messages and designed to help her overcome her sorrow while gradually making the transition into a new life. Holly Kennedy (Hilary Swank) is a New York real estate broker whose good-humored husband, Irishman Gerry (Gerard Butler), always stood by her side. Suddenly, and seemingly out of nowhere, Gerry succumbs to a brain tumor and Holly is left to face an uncertain future. No one in the world knows Holly better than Gerry, not even her mother (Kathy Bates) or her best friends, Sharon (Gina Gershon) and Denise (Lisa Kudrow). But while Holly remains unsure if she can go on without the love of her life to help guide her, Gerry has planned ahead. On Holly's 30th birthday, she receives a cake and a special tape recording from Gerry that implores her to get out and celebrate instead of staying in and mourning. Later, as the months wear on, a series of additional messages arrive from Gerry -- always delivered in the most remarkable and surprising of ways. With each new message comes a new adventure, and each letter signs off in the same familiar way: "P.S. I love you." Despite the fact that Holly's mother and friends think these humorous, posthumous messages are keeping Holly bound to the past, the truth is that they are lovingly guiding her into the future while proving that sometimes death isn't just the end, but a new beginning as well. Director Richard LaGravenese teams with screenwriter Steve Rogers to adapt author Cecelia Ahern's best-selling novel(n)</desc>

The Feds are prepared to escort "most-wanted" criminal Miguel Escobar (Carlos Gomez) to his long-overdue trial, and Monk (Tony Shalhoub) is summoned to jury duty on a minor robbery case. Though it makes him queasy to be locked in a room with eleven strangers, Monk appears to be in no hurry to leave when he is the only one to vote "Not Guilty." As he tries to sway the other jurors to his way of thinking, Monk finds himself saddled with another legal headache when the body of a dead woman is found stuffed in a dumpster just outside the courtroom. This being Monk, it is virtually a foregone conclusion that our hero's "Not Guilty" ballot, the woman's death, and the impending Escobar trial are all linked together(n)</desc>

Bruce Nolan is a television reporter working in Buffalo, NY, who has been growing increasingly dissatisfied with his existence, and after an especially bad day, he flies into a rage and curses God for making his life miserable. To Bruce's great surprise, the Supreme Being Himself appears, and tries to convince Bruce of the enormity of his task. Bruce, however, isn't buying it, so God gives him a chance to find out what he's up against; God bestows all of his powers on Bruce for a week, to see how he'd handle things. At first, Bruce has a great time bending the world around him to his will, much to the puzzlement of his girlfriend, Grace (Jennifer Aniston), but after six days God stops by to remind Bruce he hasn't done much to make the Earth a better place. Disappointed, God presents Bruce with an ultimatum -- he has one day to improve the world in a concrete way, or God will toss the planet back into the void. Bruce Almighty was directed by Tom Shadyac, who previously teamed with Jim Carrey for Liar, Liar and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective(n)</desc>

After a series of mishaps, including the arrest and incarceration of the officer in charge of the project, the unlucky pair are abandoned and forgotten, only to wake up 500 years later in a world where the rampant breeding of stupid people has created a universally dumb society ruled by half-wits.

    <desc lang="en">A man with a remarkable talent for violence must fight to survive when he sets out on an extraordinary journey in this fantasy from director Nicolas Winding Refn. One Eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is the nickname given to a nameless, mute warrior who has become a slave to Barde (Alexander Morton), a wealthy Scotsman who obtained One Eye for his remarkable fighting skills. One Eye is a fierce warrior but shows little loyalty to his master, and when the opportunity presents itself, One Eye murders Barde and his mercenaries and sets off on his own, with a young boy (Maarten Stevenson) tagging along to speak on his behalf. Eager to leave Denmark behind in favor of freedom and adventure, One Eye throws in his lot with a band of Christian Vikings, who've set out on an ambitious quest to travel to Jerusalem and claim the Holy Land as their own. But the voyage to the Holy City is a difficult one, and the Vikings are met with violent resistance, forcing One Eye to rely on his talents as a warrior to protect himself and his young apprentice. Valhalla Rising received its North American premiere at the 2009 Toronto Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Michelle a La Cart. To prove to snotty classmate Kenny (J. Evan Bonifant) that girls are just as good as boys, Michelle (the Olsen twins) enters a go-kart competition.

Elsewhere, DJ (Candace Cameron) and Steve (Scott Weinger) have trouble adjusting to being friends, lovers no more; and Steph (Jodie Sweetin), whose arm is in a sling due to a real-life accident) uses her ballet skills to help Joey (David Coulier) improve his hockey game(n)</desc>

In the second of Friends' four special 40-minute episodes which originally ran in February 2000, the magic number is not "40" but "30," as Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) becomes the last of the friends to hit the big three-oh.

And there's something else: thanks to her redoubtable twin sister, Ursula, Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) discovers that she's slightly older than she ever suspected(n)</desc>

When the corpse of the man ghost-writing the memoirs of former British Prime Minister Adam Lang is found, apparently having accidentally fallen from a ferry, another writer is quickly hired to finish the job. The new man (McGregor, in an un-named role) is dispatched to the ex-PM's swish home in the States, where he now resides. As the writer begins his task, he thinks it odd that he's not allowed access to his predecessor's draft but gets on with the work, under pressure from all sides to finish the job quickly. But, later, he uncovers documents, seemingly left by the dead man, which throw a new light on everything: they suggest Lang and his wealthy friends have very dark secrets, ones they'd possibly even kill for in order to keep them hidden. Will the new ghost-writer now suffer the same fate as the previous one?(n)</desc>

Earl Brooks (Costner) is a successful businessman, noted philanthropist, and loving father. He's the kind of man whom no one would ever suspect of being a notorious serial killer, but then again history's most dubious psychopaths are often the quiet neighbor whom no one would ever suspect was capable of committing such unspeakable atrocities. Until now, no one has had any reason to link Earl Brooks with the heinous crimes of the dreaded Thumbprint Killer. Even his beautiful wife (Marg Helgenbeger) and teenage daughter (Danielle Panabaker) could never conceive of such an awful truth. But when Mr. Brooks's dark side begins to outshine his sane exterior, an amateur photographer (Dane Cook) captures the killer succumbing to his murderous instinct on film. Now, as Mr. Brooks is pursued by tenacious detective Tracy Atwood (Moore) and forced to bend to the will of an opportunistic bystander, the killer who was once able to keep his murderous alter ego (Hurt) in check finds his control steadily slipping(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Double Whammy</title>
    <desc lang="en">A cop tries to sort out his personal life while a wave of odd behavior sweeps through his apartment building in this quirky comedy. Ray Pluto (Dennis Leary) is a New York City police detective who has been in an emotional slump since his wife and daughter died in an accident several years earlier. Ray's mood isn't lightened at all when he and his partner Jerry Cubbins (Steve Buscemi) stop into a fast food restaurant just as an armed robbery is taking place. Ray throws out his back while reaching for his gun and drops the weapon; a child who picks up the gun and kills the intruders is declared a hero in the press, while Ray is dubbed "the loser cop." Put on medical leave, Ray sinks deeper into a funk until he starts seeing a chiropractor for his bad back; the beautiful Dr. Ann Beamer (Elizabeth Hurley) begins kneading the kinks out of Ray's spine and starts him thinking about a new romance. Meanwhile, Juan Benitez (Luis Guzman) is the superintendent of Ray's apartment building, and he's not been getting along well with his teenage daughter Maribel (Melonie Diaz), who has a wild streak and refuses to obey her father's strict rules. Maribel is no happier with her father, and decides to do something about their relationship -- she hires two men to assassinate her dad. And elsewhere in the same building, a pair of would-be screenwriters (Donald Faison and Keith Knobbs) wants to ensure the realism of their cops-and-robbers story by going on a little crime spree of their own. Double Whammy had its world premiere at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Deliver Us From Eva</title>
    <desc lang="en">Three men discover that meddling in their sister-in-law's love life only makes their own lives more complicated in this romantic comedy. Eva Dandridge (Gabrielle Union) developed a sense of responsibility early on in life, when after the death of her parents she was left to care for her three younger sisters, Kareenah (Essence Atkins), Bethany (Robinne Lee), and Jacqui (Meagan Good). All four of the Dandridge sisters have grown up to be attractive, intelligent, and successful; Kareenah is happily married to Tim (Mel Jackson), while Bethany is engaged to Michael (Duane Martin), and Jacqui is going steady with Darrell (Dartanyan Edmonds). However, Eva still watches over her siblings like a hawk, and while her sisters love Eva dearly, Tim, Michael, and Darrell wish their sister-in-law would stay out of their business. The guys decide that if Eva had a boyfriend, she might be less interested in running other people's lives, and they turn to Ray (LL Cool J), a notorious ladies' man, for help. Ray is short on cash, so the guys make him a deal -- they'll give him 5,000 dollars to romance Eva, sweep her off her feet, and then dump her a few weeks later. Ray agrees, and while getting past her no-nonsense demeanor takes some doing, before long she's head over heels for him. However, Ray unexpectedly finds himself falling in love with Eva, and Eva, when offered a job in another town, decides to stay on to be with Ray. Even worse, the other Dandridge sisters are so impressed with the romantic Ray that they start demanding a bit more TLC from their own men(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Deliver Us From Eva</title>
    <desc lang="en">Three men discover that meddling in their sister-in-law's love life only makes their own lives more complicated in this romantic comedy. Eva Dandridge (Gabrielle Union) developed a sense of responsibility early on in life, when after the death of her parents she was left to care for her three younger sisters, Kareenah (Essence Atkins), Bethany (Robinne Lee), and Jacqui (Meagan Good). All four of the Dandridge sisters have grown up to be attractive, intelligent, and successful; Kareenah is happily married to Tim (Mel Jackson), while Bethany is engaged to Michael (Duane Martin), and Jacqui is going steady with Darrell (Dartanyan Edmonds). However, Eva still watches over her siblings like a hawk, and while her sisters love Eva dearly, Tim, Michael, and Darrell wish their sister-in-law would stay out of their business. The guys decide that if Eva had a boyfriend, she might be less interested in running other people's lives, and they turn to Ray (LL Cool J), a notorious ladies' man, for help. Ray is short on cash, so the guys make him a deal -- they'll give him 5,000 dollars to romance Eva, sweep her off her feet, and then dump her a few weeks later. Ray agrees, and while getting past her no-nonsense demeanor takes some doing, before long she's head over heels for him. However, Ray unexpectedly finds himself falling in love with Eva, and Eva, when offered a job in another town, decides to stay on to be with Ray. Even worse, the other Dandridge sisters are so impressed with the romantic Ray that they start demanding a bit more TLC from their own men(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A single woman envies the security of her married friends, while they in turn dream of her freedom in this comedy drama. Olivia (Jennifer Aniston) is a single woman in her mid-thirties who feels she's reached a crossroads in her life. Unhappy with her career as a teacher, Olivia quits and takes a job as a maid until she sorts out her feelings. However, Olivia feels as if she could use some support, both personal and financial, from her best friends, all of whom at very least have more in the bank than she does. But that's not to say they don't have problems of their own. Christine (Catherine Keener) and her husband Patrick (Jason Isaacs) are screenwriters who have discovered that collaborating is more stress than they can deal with. Jane (Frances McDormand) is married to Aaron (Simon McBurney); they work together as designers, but while their professional relationship is cordial, they've become numb to one another as lovers and friends. And Franny (Joan Cusack) and Matt (Greg Germann) are a couple who comfortably support themselves and their children thanks to an inherited fortune; while their material needs are met, emotionally they can barely handle marriage and parenthood. Friends With Money was written and directed by Nicole Holofcener, who previously made the acclaimed independent features Walking and Talking and Lovely &amp; Amazing(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Dark Girls</title>
    <desc lang="en">When Africans were first brought to the United States as slaves, many slave owners took a strange approach to diving the labor among the humans they owned -- lighter skinned blacks were assigned to work inside the house, performing more precise but less physically demanding chores, while their darker skinned brethren were forced to perform punishing manual labor in the fields. In the 21st Century, a grim vestige of this tradition lives on in African-American culture, as women with dark complexion often find themselves looked down upon by their peers, considered less attractive, less intelligent and less refined than women with a lighter skin tone. A variety of African-American women discuss this phenomenon, sharing their thoughts on the social and cultural implications of this subtle but common form of prejudice, in the documentary Dark Girls. Directors Bill Duke and D. Channsin Berry feature interviews with women sharing their own experiences as dark skinned African-Americans, children who reveal how young these beliefs are implanted in girls, and men who share their feelings about women and skin color. Dark Girls was an official selection at the 2011 Toronto Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Hotel Rwanda</title>
    <desc lang="en">Terry George's moving, dramatic film is based on a true story from the Rwanda genocide of 1994. Don Cheadle plays Hutu Paul Rusesabagina, the manager of a four-star hotel in the capital Kigali, who's married to Tutsi Tatiana. When the Hutus start massacring Tutsis, he gives refuge to over 1000 Tutsis in the hotel and its grounds. At first, he uses the hotel's stock of beer, wine and spirits to bribe the marauding, murderous Hutu gangs. But as stocks run low, he must use all the diplomatic skills he learnt as a successful manager to save not just the lives of the Tutsis but his own and those of his family. The film also stars Nick Nolte as Col Oliver, a UN representative in the capital who finds himself impotent and without any support as the world abandons Rwanda's Tutsis to their terrible fate(n)</desc>

Television reporter Angela Vidal (Carpenter) and her trusty cameraman (Steve Harris) were documenting a night in the life of a Los Angeles fire station crew when the firefighters were summoned to a nearby apartment building to answer a routine 911 call. Upon arriving at the scene, Angela and company discover that police have already arrived to investigate the blood-curdling screams ringing out from one of the apartments. One of the women living in the building has been infected with something terrible, but what? When a few of the other residents are viciously attacked, they try to escape and discover that the CDC has quarantined the building. The officials in charge won't relay any information to those trapped inside the building, and it's impossible to seek information from the outside since telephone, Internet, television, and cell-phone access have all been cut off. By the time the quarantine is lifted, the intrepid cameraman's chilling footage provides the only evidence of the horrors that unfolded on that terrible night(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Impostor</title>
    <desc lang="en">This long-delayed science fiction thriller from director Gary Fleder was actually filmed prior to his box-office hit Don't Say a Word (2001), which preceded it in theaters by several months. Based on a 1953 short story by Philip K. Dick, the film shares that schizophrenic author's long-running obsessions with concealed identity and humanity's potential inferiority to alternative life forms. Gary Sinise stars as Spencer John Olham, a respected government scientist in the year 2079 trying to devise a secret weapon that will help his fellow humans win a decade-long war with invading aliens that are cloning human subjects and using the replicas as walking time bombs. Suddenly, Olham is accused of being an alien spy and a nationwide manhunt to capture him ensues. With even his doctor wife (Madeleine Stowe) unsure that she can trust him, Olham must uncover the truth on his own, even as he's relentlessly pursued by Hathaway (Vincent D'Onofrio), a federal agent charged with destroying the clones. Imposter has a complicated history, originally produced in early 2000 as a 30-minute short to be included in an anthology entitled "The Light Years Trilogy," a project that never got off the ground. So impressed was Dimension Films with the completed piece, however, that the footage was incorporated into a new feature version. That film was then shuffled around the release schedule for more than a year as effects were completed, reshoots were ordered, and the film was recut for a PG-13 rating instead of its original R. The R-rated "director's cut" was later released on DVD(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Perfect Holiday</title>
    <desc lang="en">Gabrielle Union, Morris Chestnut, Queen Latifah, and Terrence Howard star in a film concerning a young girl who implores a department-store Santa to find a new husband for her divorced mother for Christmas. Single mother of three Nancy (Union) has been putting the needs of her three children ahead of her own for as far back as she can remember, and lately her youngest daughter, Emily (Khail Bryant), has become acutely aware of her mother's palpable sadness. As Christmas draws near, Nancy takes her kids to the mall for a cheerful visit with jolly old Saint Nick. When it comes time for Emily's turn to sit on Santa's lap and make her Christmas wish, she selflessly remembers her mother's recent comment that a compliment from a man would be the best gift of all. Determined to make her mother happy again even if it means sacrificing her own wish, Emily relays the message to Santa (Chestnut), not realizing that the man beneath the beard is actually an office-supply salesman and ambitious singer/songwriter named Benjamin. Recognizing the daughter's love for her mother and sensing something truly special in Nancy, Benjamin cheerfully obliges the young girl, setting into motion a series of events that promise to make this the most memorable holiday in quite some time. Lance Rivera directs a film produced by Shakim Compere and Latifah through Flavor Unit Entertainment(n)</desc>

Edward's endless recounting of yarns about himself has distanced father and son. But when Edward is diagnosed with terminal cancer, William returns to the family home to try and make his peace, and find out who his father really is.

    <title lang="en">Friday the 13th</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Marcus Nispel seems to have a bit of thing for remakes, having remoulded The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in 2003, as well as Conan the Barbarian this year. However, in this slasher horror, Nispel compresses elements of the first four films in the Friday the 13th franchise, which started way back in 1980, into one blood-sodden whole. This retread gives some background as to why Jason Voorhees became such a relentlessly homicidal maniac, before getting on with the business of steel on flesh and bucketloads of gore, delivering the movie's raison d'être. Some weeks after his sister goes missing, Clay Miller's search for his sibling leads him to Crystal Lake, a remote, wooded campsite. Also arriving at the spot is a group of young revellers, intent on partying. But it's not long before the man with the hockey mask and machete pays them a visit that any survivors are unlikely to forget. Can any of them escape Voorhees' latest murderous rampage? Or will they all vanish like Clay's sister and her friends?(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Independence Day</title>
    <desc lang="en">Roland Emmerich's blockbuster of a science fiction film sees aliens reach Earth. And they're decidedly hostile - their plan is to suck the planet of all its resources and leave behind a burnt cinder circling the sun before moving on. Planting giant ships above the world's major cities, they unleash destruction on an unprecedented scale (superbly caught by the special effects). All attempts at fighting back are met by hordes of fighter craft until pilot Steven Hiller manages to down one and capture the pilot. In tandem, scientist David Levinson, having worked out their purpose, also works out a way to destroy them but he and Hiller need a space craft. Which brings them to a secret base near Las Vegas. The child of countless science fiction movies, Independence Day is rollicking, fast-moving fun and if the fate of the remains of the human race is never in doubt, there's enough tension and action to carry even the most jaundiced viewer along(n)</desc>
