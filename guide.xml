The remains have been identified as dating back to Roman times, but it has yet to be determined who these people were and how their heads ended up buried on the site. Archaeologists examine the bones for evidence of the various theories that have been suggested, questioning whether the skulls belonged to gladiators, executed rebels or the victims of a massacre, or formed part of a grisly ritual.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Paul O'Grady's Hollywood</title>
    <desc lang="en">The TV presenter continues his comprehensive exploration of the bombastic side of Hollywood, this time turning his attention to musical numbers that have elevated the popularity of their respective films. Over the years, Tinseltown musicals have touched on a wide variety of cinematic genres, from the family-friendly fantasies to urban dance and even more macabre territory via The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Here, Paul revisits Mary Poppins' tongue-twisting Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, Pinball Wizard from Tommy, and a variety of numbers from Fame and Flashdance. He also sheds light on how Disney animation studios are keeping the musical genre alive, with blockbuster hits such as Frozen, which came complete with its own Oscar-winning girl-power anthem Let It Go. Includes contributions by Jonathan Ross, Celine Dion, Maureen Lipman and more. The concluding part can be seen on More4 tomorrow at 9pm.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Shattered Glass</title>
    <desc lang="en">Before Jayson Blair made headlines for his plagiarized New York Times reporting, Stephen Glass defamed the weekly current events magazine The New Republic with a series of eye-catching, entertaining, and completely fabricated stories. Now Glass' trail of lies gets the big-screen treatment in writer/director Billy Ray's Shattered Glass, featuring Hayden Christensen in the title role. The film chronicles Glass' time at the magazine in the late '90s, when his colorful coverage of a hedonistic Young Republican convention, superstar web hackers, and the circus surrounding the Bill Clinton/Monica Lewinsky scandal made him the toast of the publishing world, garnering attention from such national publications as George and Rolling Stone. Barely out of college, the eager Glass ingratiates himself with the office staff, including his mentor, managing editor Michael Kelly (Hank Azaria). But when Kelly is unceremoniously fired and replaced with editor Chuck Lane (Peter Sarsgaard), Glass' pieces come under a greater degree of scrutiny, until one in particular threatens to expose his tall tales to the rest of the world. Based in part on a Vanity Fair article by journalist Buzz Bissinger, Shattered Glass premiered at the Telluride and Toronto film festivals before its limited fall theatrical release(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">National Security</title>
    <desc lang="en">The mismatched cops variation of the buddy comedy genre gets taken out of mothballs for this farce directed by longtime Adam Sandler collaborator Dennis Dugan. Martin Lawrence and Steve Zahn star, respectively, as Earl Montgomery, a loudmouthed police academy reject, and Hank Rafferty, a mild-mannered cop who is disgraced and dismissed from his job. Having met once before on a traffic stop, the two men are less than thrilled to be paired together as security guards. When the two men discover a complex smuggling scheme, however, they put aside their animosity to investigate the criminal scheme. They soon learn that the illegal enterprise involves a mastermind named Nash (Eric Roberts) and a new, virtually indestructible metal that's worth a fortune. Unable to persuade Hank's former police department superiors that they're onto a huge case, the two partners must devise a way to expose the sophisticated scam and bring down Nash on their own. National Security co-stars Colm Feore, Bill Duke, Timothy Busfield, and Wayne Knight(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Sixth Sense</title>
    <desc lang="en">(1999) M Night Shyamalan's chiller about a boy who has the not-entirely-welcome ability to directly contact the dead. Bruce Willis stars as child psychologist Dr Malcolm Crowe, who is asked to help Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), who claims he can 'see dead people'. Crowe is sceptical at first, but - prompted partly by a past case he felt he badly let down - he's gradually convinced that the boy is telling the truth. Crowe believes that actively engaging with the ghostly presences could help both Sear and the spirits to find peace. Overcoming his terror, the lad finds that communicating with the deceased does, at first, seem to be beneficial. But then matters take on their own momentum, leading to one of the director's trademark plot twists... Also starring Toni Collette. M,W,S,(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">(2010) Michael Cera (Juno, Superbad) stars in this unconventionally structured, inventive and comic paean to the alternate universe of manga and computer gaming. The movie is based on an acclaimed series of graphic novels by Canadian cartoonist Bryan Lee O'Malley, and is directed by British film-maker Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Channel 4's TV series Spaced), here making his Hollywood debut. Computer game fanatic Scott Pilgrim (Cera) is the bass player with Toronto band Sex Bob-omb. He shares his flat with his slightly-out-of-control gay friend Wallace Wells (Kieran Culkin), and courts a little controversy by dating 17-year-old schoolgirl Knives Chau (Ellen Wong). However, theirs is a fairly platonic relationship, and one he's prepared to ditch the moment he sets eyes on the woman (literally) of his dreams: Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). But if Scott wants to capture the impossibly cool New Yorker's heart, he must first defeat her former lovers, the Seven Evil Exes, in video game end-level-style combat. So he embarks on a kinetic, romantic quest, largely conducted within his own head, replete with slapstick violence, impressive effects and witty retorts(n)</desc>

The Jamaicans won three of the four relays in 2015, with only USA's men's 4x400m triumph preventing a clean sweep, and the likes of Elaine Thompson and Usain Bolt may be rested in the 4x100m, where the champions boast significant strength in depth. The decathlon also continues with the 110m hurdles, discus and pole vault. Coverage continues on BBC2.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A chance to see a performance of the ground-breaking drama To the Sea, the third instalment of James Phillips' epic four-part multimedia narrative Flood, which explores what might happen if England was destroyed by a global flood. Serving as a post-apocalyptic re-imagining of the flood myth found in Judeo-Christian scripture, the first part of Phillips' tale took the form of a short online film in which an enigmatic girl is dragged - still living - from deep beneath the waves by a North Sea fisherman. The second part, Abundance, was presented as a live open-air play at Victoria Dock in Hull earlier this year, and tonight's third installment asks a simple question: what if the masses of refugees, frequently seen on news broadcasts fleeing scenes of devastation, had English accents?.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The TV presenter continues his comprehensive exploration of the bombastic side of Hollywood, this time turning his attention to musical numbers that have elevated the popularity of their respective films. Over the years, Tinseltown musicals have touched on a wide variety of cinematic genres, from the family-friendly fantasies to urban dance and even more macabre territory via The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Here, Paul revisits Mary Poppins' tongue-twisting Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, Pinball Wizard from Tommy, and a variety of numbers from Fame and Flashdance. He also sheds light on how Disney animation studios are keeping the musical genre alive, with blockbuster hits such as Frozen, which came complete with its own Oscar-winning girl-power anthem Let It Go. Includes contributions by Jonathan Ross, Celine Dion, Maureen Lipman and more. The concluding part can be seen on More4 tomorrow at 9pm.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">The Adele Story.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Documentary charting the remarkable career trajectory of Adele Adkins, the pop and soul singer who rose from humble beginnings in Tottenham to become one of the biggest stars of the modern music industry. Now popular enough to warrant going by her forename only, Adele's interest in music was encouraged by her mother from an early age. Winning a place at the Brit School in Croydon, Adele first shot into the public eye when her friend uploaded a demo to MySpace in 2006, and by the time she graduated, the singer had already secured a record deal. What followed were three hugely successful albums, 19, 21 and 25, each of which surpassed the last in terms of critical acclaim and sales figures. Adele also scored an Oscar in 2013 for her song Skyfall, which featured as the theme of the James Bond film of the same name.(n)</desc>

Jorge's (Cesar Ramos) adolescent sister, Adriana (Paulina Gaitan), has been kidnapped and thrust into a lucrative underground trade in which young girls are bought and sold to the highest bidder. Now, as the terrified youngster is herded through a complex network of underground tunnels leading into the United States, her only ally is a Polish woman named Veronica (Alicja Bachleda), who has been tricked into the trade by the same nefarious gang. After circumventing immigration officers and eventually working his way across the border, the desperate Jorge comes into contact with a Texas lawman named Ray (Kevin Kline), whose own devastating personal loss to sex traffickers causes him to join the search for Adriana. In the dark days that follow, Jorge and Ray form a close bond as they witness the horrors of a secret Internet sex slave auction and discover just how far the depths of human depravity can plunge while attempting to maintain hope that brother and sister will one day be reunited. In the world of international sex trafficking, however, innocent victims disappear without a trace every day and few who fall prey to these reprehensible predators are ever seen again(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Following the life of cocaine-trafficking pioneer George Jung in a way that recalls Martin Scorsese's Casino, Blow recounts the man's days from his 1950s childhood in Boston to his downfall in the 1980s. George (played by Johnny Depp) begins his life as the son of Fred (Ray Liotta), an earnest breadwinner, and Ermine (Rachel Griffiths), who frequently walks out on them in pursuit of a more fulfilling life. When George moves west to California in the late '60s, accompanied by best pal Tuna (Ethan Suplee), he becomes an entrepreneur in the marijuana business, which soon spreads to the East Coast as well, with girlfriend Barbara (Franka Potente) smuggling the product during her stewardess shifts. George is arrested in 1972 -- at which time Barbara dies of cancer -- but George finds a new ally in Diego (Jordi Molla), who proposes the idea that he become the American conduit for Colombian kingpin Pablo Escobar (Cliff Curtis). George flourishes in the heyday of the disco era, and falls for Mirtha (Penelope Cruz), a self-serving bombshell who eventually has a daughter with him. Trouble escalates as the FBI threatens to bring George and his crew down, while he desperately tries to be a stable parent to his young offspring. Blow also features Paul Reubens and Max Perlich in featured roles(n)</desc>

Jorge's (Cesar Ramos) adolescent sister, Adriana (Paulina Gaitan), has been kidnapped and thrust into a lucrative underground trade in which young girls are bought and sold to the highest bidder. Now, as the terrified youngster is herded through a complex network of underground tunnels leading into the United States, her only ally is a Polish woman named Veronica (Alicja Bachleda), who has been tricked into the trade by the same nefarious gang. After circumventing immigration officers and eventually working his way across the border, the desperate Jorge comes into contact with a Texas lawman named Ray (Kevin Kline), whose own devastating personal loss to sex traffickers causes him to join the search for Adriana. In the dark days that follow, Jorge and Ray form a close bond as they witness the horrors of a secret Internet sex slave auction and discover just how far the depths of human depravity can plunge while attempting to maintain hope that brother and sister will one day be reunited. In the world of international sex trafficking, however, innocent victims disappear without a trace every day and few who fall prey to these reprehensible predators are ever seen again(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Following the life of cocaine-trafficking pioneer George Jung in a way that recalls Martin Scorsese's Casino, Blow recounts the man's days from his 1950s childhood in Boston to his downfall in the 1980s. George (played by Johnny Depp) begins his life as the son of Fred (Ray Liotta), an earnest breadwinner, and Ermine (Rachel Griffiths), who frequently walks out on them in pursuit of a more fulfilling life. When George moves west to California in the late '60s, accompanied by best pal Tuna (Ethan Suplee), he becomes an entrepreneur in the marijuana business, which soon spreads to the East Coast as well, with girlfriend Barbara (Franka Potente) smuggling the product during her stewardess shifts. George is arrested in 1972 -- at which time Barbara dies of cancer -- but George finds a new ally in Diego (Jordi Molla), who proposes the idea that he become the American conduit for Colombian kingpin Pablo Escobar (Cliff Curtis). George flourishes in the heyday of the disco era, and falls for Mirtha (Penelope Cruz), a self-serving bombshell who eventually has a daughter with him. Trouble escalates as the FBI threatens to bring George and his crew down, while he desperately tries to be a stable parent to his young offspring. Blow also features Paul Reubens and Max Perlich in featured roles(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The hard work, dedication, and personal politics behind "rah rah rah!" and "sis boom bah!" go under the microscope in this engaging teen comedy. Torrance Shipman (Kirsten Dunst) discovers that being captain of her San Diego high school's six-time championship-winning cheerleading squad is more complicated than she had imagined. Torrance's parents want her to spend more time on her homework, her boyfriend wants her to spend more time with him, and she learns that the squad's former captain stole some of their best routines from other teams -- and that Isis (Gabrielle Union), captain of a top squad at a crosstown, inner-city high school, plans to fight back this year. To make things worse, when one of the cheerleaders is injured, Torrance is forced to replace her with Missy (Eliza Dushku), a cynical new kid who is involved only because the school doesn't offer gymnastics. In the midst of this chaos, with the national championship around the corner, Torrance couldn't have picked a worse time to fall in love with Cliff (Jesse Bradford), a classmate who cares a lot more about punk rock than school spirit. Dunst trained with a cheerleading squad for her role, though a double performed the more complicated stunts(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Roughly once every 40 years in the northern Kalahari Desert of Botswana an ancient waterway called the Savute channel fills and flows into the surrounding marshes. This attracts thousands of grazing animals from across the region - and also draws predators to the area. This documentary follows the fortunes of Africa's largest herd of elephants and a pride of seven lions as they come face to face in an epic fight for survival, with drought having weakened the elephants and the lions desperately hungry. Narrated by Imogen Stubbs.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Return of the Giant Killers: Africa's Lion Kings.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Documentary revisiting the pride of African lions featured in Africa's Giant Killers: Natural World, which detailed a clash between drought-weakened elephants and hungry big cats in the northern stretches of the Kalahari Desert in Botswana. This follow-up rejoins the pride at the start of the rainy season, when the departure of the elephants brings a whole host of new problems for the lions. The males begin to turn against each other, and one inexperienced lioness places her cubs in mortal danger as a rival group challenges the area's resident lions. Wild fires caused by lightning devastate the landscape, and as the dust begins to settle, the pride must once again face off with the elephants or risk starvation. Narrated by Imogen Stubbs.(n)</desc>

Though there are many gadgets, the film is the least gimmicky of all the Bond movies, and is powered by several excellent action set pieces, most notably Connery's fight with arch-villain Robert Shaw on a passenger train(n)</desc>

Dr. No is the film that made former body-builder Sean Connery a star. Actress Ursula Andress also made a splash as the bikini-clad seductress who rises from the sea to use Bond to get revenge upon Dr. No. Bond himself is also after No, who, according to Bond's boss M, is about to financially ruin the United States. Bond's search for the crazed extortionist leads him to Jamaica and gets him into a variety of potentially dangerous scrapes, that while nowhere near as elaborate as those in subsequent Bond films, are still exciting(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Gunmen</title>
    <desc lang="en">This film opens with a big fat close-up of a sweaty prisoner with a fly (on a string) crawling on his face. The prisoner quickly pops the fly in his mouth and spits it out. Then he leeringly laughs about it to the prisoner next door. Nope. This is not a bad undiscovered Sergio Leone spaghetti western. Rather it is the opening shot Deran Sarafin's Gunmen -- a brainless action film without an original thought in its head. Christopher Lambert is the fly-eater, a man named Dani Servigo, the brother of a dead smuggler and a prisoner in a South American jail, who holds the secret to the whereabouts of $400,000 in stolen drug money. The walls of the prison explode, and Cole Parker (Mario Van Pebbles) makes his entrance. Cole is a mercenary working with the DEA who is in this South American hellhole to mop up the drug traders and to avenge his father's death at the hands of the drug traders. He wants Dani to lead him to the gold. In this love-hate buddy film, the two thrown-together friends/enemies race through the Amazon jungle with ruthless assassins in pursuit, as they all gravitate towards the secret stash of money(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Speed 2: Cruise Control</title>
    <desc lang="en">This sequel to Speed sees Sandra Bullock back and Jan de Be Bont directing but with Jason Patric taking over the Keanu Reeves role. The pair are an item and decide on a romantic cruise to the Caribbean. Unfortunately, also aboard the cruise liner are a gathering of diamond merchants, complete with their wares and arch-villain Willem Defoe, who plans to steal their merchandise. Unlike the original Speed, where the trick was that the bus would explode if it slowed down, this time, speed is of the essence - the plan is to ram the ship into dry land and, in the mayhem, escape with the loot. Bullock and Patric are perfect as the dynamic duo who save the day and the ocean-going scenario allows for more spectacular special effects than the original(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Supercross</title>
    <desc lang="en">Two siblings find themselves competing on and off the racetrack in this action-packed drama. K.C. Carlyle (Steve Howey) and his kid brother, Trip (Mike Vogel), are both racers in the rough and tumble world of supercross, a revved-up variation on motocross racing in which specially modified motorcycle negotiate specially built dirt tracks that send riders through tricky twists and turns, over rough terrain, and off high-flying jumps. Both are talented racers, but K.C. has a wilder and more reckless approach, while Trip follows a more cautious path. A more profound difference between them arises when K.C. is offered a lucrative deal to ride for a factory-sponsored team; he takes the deal, and leaves his brother behind to race on his own dime. However, when an accident takes Trip out of the running on the supercross circuit, he and K.C. set aside their differences as Trip helps coach his older brother so he can succeed in his drive to the championship. Made with the cooperation of a leading supercross race promoter, Supercross: The Movie also stars Sophia Bush and Cameron Richardson as the brothers' love interests, and Robert Carradine as a determined race coach(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This was the third follow-up to Tim Burton's Batman (1989), the original revisionist look at the Gotham City legend, as well as the second in the Batman series directed by Joel Schumacher and the first featuring George Clooney as the Caped Crusader; it features not one but two super-villains, and a new heroine to fight crime alongside Bruce Wayne (aka Batman) and Dick Grayson (aka Robin) (Chris O'Donnell). The experiments of Dr. Victor Fries (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to preserve his late wife cryogenically have gone horribly wrong, turning him into the evil genius Mr. Freeze, who must keep his body at sub-zero temperature in order to say alive -- and he wants to put Gotham City on ice. Shy horticulturist Pamela Isley (Uma Thurman) goes a bit wild with a Venus Fly Trap-like creation she's been working on and mutates into Poison Ivy, who wants to kill all the people on Earth so plants can take over. Can Batman and Robin stop these fiends before their plans go too far? Meanwhile, Bruce and Dick's faithful butler Alfred (Michael Gough) isn't feeling well, so his niece Barbara (Alicia Silverstone) comes to pay a visit. When Barbara finds out what her uncle's employers do in their spare time, she decides she wants in on the action, and she joins the crime fighting twosome as Batgirl. Batman &amp; Robin also features Jesse Ventura in a small role as a prison guard; it would be his last film role before becoming Governor of Minnesota in 1998(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">August Rush</title>
    <desc lang="en">Estranged from his parents by circumstance and nudged toward a foster family, a young boy seeks out his long-lost folks and discovers prodigious musical talent in this family-oriented drama from Disco Pigs director Kirsten Sheridan. In the aftermath of a passionate night together above New York's Washington Square, a charismatic Irish guitarist named Louis (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) and a reserved cellist named Lyla (Keri Russell) are forced apart by fate. Despite the fact that they do not remain together, however, their fleeting union has created something amazing that neither could have ever anticipated -- a baby. Unfortunately, just after the child's birth, the mother is misinformed that the infant has died. Cut to 11 years later, when the child, Evan, is living in a Gotham-area boys' home and has developed an acute ability to listen to the sounds of the outside world -- hoping against all hope that his biological mother and father will turn up to claim him, while those in charge try to encourage him to open himself up to the possibility of adoption. Unduly rejecting these bids, Evan runs away into the city. Out on the streets, the child falls into the clutches of a manipulative, untrustworthy street person named Wizard (Robin Williams), who renames Evan "August Rush" and opens the boy up to the depth and breadth of his own musical talent even as he smells the opportunity to grow rich off of the foundling. Meanwhile, Evan/August's hope persists that he will be reunited with his folks, and Louis and Lyla, unable to forget their initial night of love, feel themselves being drawn back together by fate(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This was the third follow-up to Tim Burton's Batman (1989), the original revisionist look at the Gotham City legend, as well as the second in the Batman series directed by Joel Schumacher and the first featuring George Clooney as the Caped Crusader; it features not one but two super-villains, and a new heroine to fight crime alongside Bruce Wayne (aka Batman) and Dick Grayson (aka Robin) (Chris O'Donnell). The experiments of Dr. Victor Fries (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to preserve his late wife cryogenically have gone horribly wrong, turning him into the evil genius Mr. Freeze, who must keep his body at sub-zero temperature in order to say alive -- and he wants to put Gotham City on ice. Shy horticulturist Pamela Isley (Uma Thurman) goes a bit wild with a Venus Fly Trap-like creation she's been working on and mutates into Poison Ivy, who wants to kill all the people on Earth so plants can take over. Can Batman and Robin stop these fiends before their plans go too far? Meanwhile, Bruce and Dick's faithful butler Alfred (Michael Gough) isn't feeling well, so his niece Barbara (Alicia Silverstone) comes to pay a visit. When Barbara finds out what her uncle's employers do in their spare time, she decides she wants in on the action, and she joins the crime fighting twosome as Batgirl. Batman &amp; Robin also features Jesse Ventura in a small role as a prison guard; it would be his last film role before becoming Governor of Minnesota in 1998(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">August Rush</title>
    <desc lang="en">Estranged from his parents by circumstance and nudged toward a foster family, a young boy seeks out his long-lost folks and discovers prodigious musical talent in this family-oriented drama from Disco Pigs director Kirsten Sheridan. In the aftermath of a passionate night together above New York's Washington Square, a charismatic Irish guitarist named Louis (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) and a reserved cellist named Lyla (Keri Russell) are forced apart by fate. Despite the fact that they do not remain together, however, their fleeting union has created something amazing that neither could have ever anticipated -- a baby. Unfortunately, just after the child's birth, the mother is misinformed that the infant has died. Cut to 11 years later, when the child, Evan, is living in a Gotham-area boys' home and has developed an acute ability to listen to the sounds of the outside world -- hoping against all hope that his biological mother and father will turn up to claim him, while those in charge try to encourage him to open himself up to the possibility of adoption. Unduly rejecting these bids, Evan runs away into the city. Out on the streets, the child falls into the clutches of a manipulative, untrustworthy street person named Wizard (Robin Williams), who renames Evan "August Rush" and opens the boy up to the depth and breadth of his own musical talent even as he smells the opportunity to grow rich off of the foundling. Meanwhile, Evan/August's hope persists that he will be reunited with his folks, and Louis and Lyla, unable to forget their initial night of love, feel themselves being drawn back together by fate(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Conjuring</title>
    <desc lang="en">A demonic entity lays claim to family living in a secluded farmhouse, prompting them to seek the aid of two renowned paranormal researchers in this tale of possession inspired by actual events. The story gets underway as paranormal researchers Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) evaluate a mysterious doll discovered by a trio of young roommates in 1968. Believing their house to be haunted by the wayward spirit of a deceased young girl, they give the girl permission to inhabit the doll, and soon their lives become a waking nightmare. Informed by Ed and Lorraine that they have fallen victim to an inhuman spirit (aka a demon) seeking a human host, the roommates entrust the doll to the Warrens, who place it in their personal museum for safekeeping. Flash forward three years to Harrisville, RI, where the Perron family have just moved into their country dream home -- an 18th century farmhouse that offers plenty of space for parents Carolyn (Lili Taylor) and Roger (Ron Livingston), as well as their five daughters Andrea (Shanley Caswell), Nancy (Hayley McFarland), Christine (Joey King), Cindy (Mackenzie Foy), and April (Kyla Deaver). It seems like the ideal place to raise a family until a series of unsettling events leave the Perron family convinced they are not alone. Terrified, Carolyn reaches out to the Warrens for help, and learns that a demonic entity has attached itself to her family, and has no intentions of letting them go. Meanwhile, the deeper the Warrens delve into the farmhouse's history, the clearer it becomes that this spirit has a murderous agenda, and that no one will be safe until it is driven back into darkness(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Conjuring</title>
    <desc lang="en">A demonic entity lays claim to family living in a secluded farmhouse, prompting them to seek the aid of two renowned paranormal researchers in this tale of possession inspired by actual events. The story gets underway as paranormal researchers Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) evaluate a mysterious doll discovered by a trio of young roommates in 1968. Believing their house to be haunted by the wayward spirit of a deceased young girl, they give the girl permission to inhabit the doll, and soon their lives become a waking nightmare. Informed by Ed and Lorraine that they have fallen victim to an inhuman spirit (aka a demon) seeking a human host, the roommates entrust the doll to the Warrens, who place it in their personal museum for safekeeping. Flash forward three years to Harrisville, RI, where the Perron family have just moved into their country dream home -- an 18th century farmhouse that offers plenty of space for parents Carolyn (Lili Taylor) and Roger (Ron Livingston), as well as their five daughters Andrea (Shanley Caswell), Nancy (Hayley McFarland), Christine (Joey King), Cindy (Mackenzie Foy), and April (Kyla Deaver). It seems like the ideal place to raise a family until a series of unsettling events leave the Perron family convinced they are not alone. Terrified, Carolyn reaches out to the Warrens for help, and learns that a demonic entity has attached itself to her family, and has no intentions of letting them go. Meanwhile, the deeper the Warrens delve into the farmhouse's history, the clearer it becomes that this spirit has a murderous agenda, and that no one will be safe until it is driven back into darkness(n)</desc>

Carlos and Elena are close friends with Mike White (McCaleb Burnett) and Betty Bristol (Ashley Wolfe), who were born and raised in the States. Like Carlos and Elena, Mike and Betty are planning to marry but haven't done so yet, and when they learn of their friends' dilemma, someone comes up with a solution -- Carlos will marry Betty, Mike will marry Elena, and once their respective green cards come through, both couples will divorce and everyone lives happily ever after. However, the plan doesn't go as smoothly as expected -- suspicious immigration agents are keeping a close watch on Carlos and Elena, so the newlyweds have to live with their respective spouses and act happily married in order to maintain the illusion of matrimony, which leads the four friends into a variety of romantic complications.

The real criminals managed to escape and frame Miss Piggy as the thief. Kermit, Fozzie and the Great Gonzo set out on a mission to solve the mystery and track down the criminals who stole the Baseball Diamond.

Teen Tracy Turnblad's regular cultural highlight is a local television music-and-dance programme called The Corny Collins Show. And, like all her friends, she dreams of having a chance to appear on it. However, this is Baltimore and it is 1962 - and Tracy's both overweight and, worse, has liberal attitudes to race relations, which don't sit comfortably with the segregationist views of the show's producer. But, could Tracy's ambitions for not only appearing on the show, but also racially integrating it, receive a fillip when she meets the son of Motormouth Maybelle, host of the monthly 'Negro Day' edition of the show? Also starring John Travolta (in drag and a fat-suit) as Tracy's mum, Christopher Walken, as her dad, and Amanda Bynes, James Marsden, Brittany Snow, Zac Efron and Elijah Kelley; plus cameos from the star of the original movie, Ricki Lake, and its director, John Waters(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Parenthood</title>
    <desc lang="en">This feel-good ensemble comedy tracks a quartet of suburban siblings and their families over the course of a single summer. Hardworking Gil Buckman (Steve Martin) and his stay-at-home wife, Karen (Mary Steeenburgen), have just a few months to help their oldest son, Kevin (Jasen Fisher), overcome his high-strung behavior problems before he'll be relegated to special-education classes. Gil's difficult relationship with his own father, Frank (Jason Robards), has led him to become a would-be super-dad for his three kids, so he takes his son's difficulties more than a little personally. Gil's sister, Helen (Dianne Wiest), is trying to raise a moody, adolescent son (Leaf Phoenix) and an independent-minded daughter (Martha Plimpton) with no help from her well-off ex-husband, who's more interested in his new wife and family. Gil and Helen's sister, Susan (Harley Jane Kozak), meanwhile, must participate in the too-scripted Big Life Plans of her anal-retentive husband, Nathan (Rick Moranis), whose overachiever zeal infects even their toddler daughter. When long-lost brother Larry (Tom Hulce) show up with yet another get-rich-quick scheme, he brings with him a surprise addition to the family. Screenwriters Babaloo Mandel, Lowell Ganz, and Ron Howard negotiate their varied subplots with a deftness and comedic touch that transforms this conflicted clan into a suburban everyfamily(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Iain Softley's CGI fantasy adventure about a man with an extraordinary talent - and the consequences of his using it - stars Brendan Fraser, Paul Bettany and Andy Serkis. Mo Folchart is a 'silvertongue' - someone who possesses the ability to summon forth characters from the pages of novels and bring them into physical being in the real world. But it's a gift he does his best to hide from the rest of us, because there's a terrible price to be paid: each time a fictional character is brought to life, the vacuum created within the written work must be filled by a real-life person. And this is how his wife Resa came to vanish, after he manifested three ne'er-do-wells from a story. At first he refuses to help one of them, Dustfinger. But then Dustfinger teams up with the rather more focused criminal Capricorn, who has plans to force Mo to use his talents to provide him with gargantuan wealth and power. Thus Mo and his daughter Meggie are left little choice but to set out to thwart the villains' intentions - and rescue their loved ones from literary purgatory(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Iain Softley's CGI fantasy adventure about a man with an extraordinary talent - and the consequences of his using it - stars Brendan Fraser, Paul Bettany and Andy Serkis. Mo Folchart is a 'silvertongue' - someone who possesses the ability to summon forth characters from the pages of novels and bring them into physical being in the real world. But it's a gift he does his best to hide from the rest of us, because there's a terrible price to be paid: each time a fictional character is brought to life, the vacuum created within the written work must be filled by a real-life person. And this is how his wife Resa came to vanish, after he manifested three ne'er-do-wells from a story. At first he refuses to help one of them, Dustfinger. But then Dustfinger teams up with the rather more focused criminal Capricorn, who has plans to force Mo to use his talents to provide him with gargantuan wealth and power. Thus Mo and his daughter Meggie are left little choice but to set out to thwart the villains' intentions - and rescue their loved ones from literary purgatory(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Happening</title>
    <desc lang="en">Lady in the Water director M. Night Shyamalan puts PG-13 suspense on pause to tell this grim apocalyptic tale about a family fleeing a natural disaster that poses a grave threat to the whole of humanity. Philadelphia high-school science teacher Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) is discussing the disappearance of the bees with his students when the staff is summoned to the theater and briefed about a mysterious event that is currently unfolding in New York City. According to reports, citizens in the vicinity of Central Park have suddenly and inexplicably begun seizing up just before killing themselves by whatever means are at their disposal. As the phenomena begins to spread and talk of terrorism fills the airwaves, Elliot, his wife, Alma (Zooey Deschanel), their friend Julian (John Leguizamo), and his daughter, Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez), board a train bound for the presumed safety of the country. When the train screeches to a halt before arriving at its final destination, however, the frightened passengers are forced to fend for themselves as each consecutive news report paints an increasingly grim picture of the situation in more urbanized areas. Theories abound on what could be causing the unexplainable rash of suicides, but the only thing that everyone seems to agree on is that it's some kind of airborne contagion that is carried in the wind. It would appear that humankind's reign on planet Earth has come to an end, but perhaps if this small band of survivors can find a safe place to lie low until this all blows over, all hope for survival of the species might not be lost just yet(n)</desc>

Hopkins stars as Gaylord Oakes, a CIA spy attempting -- along with his partner, Kevin Pope (Chris Rock) -- to secure a suitcase-sized nuclear bomb in Prague from a Russian black marketer (Peter Stormare). Just as the partners discover that another bidder for the device exists, they are ambushed and Pope is killed trying to protect Oakes. Desperate for the bomb's owners and their attackers to believe that Pope is still alive so that the deal can commence in ten days time, Oakes recruits his late partner's long-lost twin, ticket-scalping chess hustler Jake Hayes (also played by Rock), a small-time criminal who never knew he had a brother. Offered a sizable payday and the admiration of his student nurse girlfriend, Hayes agrees to undergo vigorous training and dangerous situations as he impersonates his brother and helps Oakes to remove the nuclear threat, but the new partners clash in every way possible, from personal discipline to musical taste. Meanwhile, the assassin of the real Kevin Pope sends another cadre of killers after the agent he believes is still alive. Bad Company co-stars Kerry Washington, Garcelle Beauvais-Nilon, Gabriel Macht, and Matthew Marsh(n)</desc>

Witwicky is being hunted down by the Decepticons, who recognise that he is their main impediment to their gaining control of an awesome source of energy.

Jasira (Summer Bishil) is a 13-year-old Arab-American who's contending with the pains of adolescence when her life takes a sudden and unexpected turn. Sent to live with her stern Lebanese father, Rifat (Peter Macdissi), by her self-absorbed mother (Maria Bello), Jasira finds herself struggling to adjust to life in the suburbs while contending with racism and hypocrisy at every turn. Rifat lives in a modest, suburban Houston home next to racist reservist Mr. Vuoso (Aaron Eckhart) and meddling expectant mother Melina (Toni Collette). Adjusting to life in the suburbs isn't easy for young Jasira, though she tries her hardest to adapt to the unfamiliar environment by striking up casual conversations with her curious new neighbors. In the process, Jasira finds herself increasingly attracted to hormone-driven African-American teen Thomas (Eugene Jones). When Rifat finds out that his daughter's new boyfriend is black, he vehemently condemns the relationship. As America launches its initial invasion of Iraq, Jasira finds herself caught up in a potentially explosive situation that is only compounded by her raging hormones and the snooping of her pregnant, busybody neighbor(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Slumdog Millionaire</title>
    <desc lang="en">Accused of cheating and desperate to prove his innocence, an eighteen-year-old orphan from the slums of Mumbai reflects back on his tumultuous life while competing to win 20 million rupees on India's Who Wants to Be a Millionaire in Danny Boyle's inspirational drama. Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) may not have a penny to his name, but that could all change in a matter of hours. He's one question away from taking the top prize on India's most popular television game show, but as with everything else in Jamal's life, it isn't going to be easy. Arrested by police under suspicion of cheating, Jamal is interrogated by the authorities. The police simply can't believe that a common "slumdog" could possibly possess the knowledge to get this far in the game, and in order to convince them of how he gained such knowledge, Jamal begins reflecting back on his childhood. As young boys, Jamal and his older brother, Salim, lived in squalor, and lost their mother in a mob attack on Muslims. Subsequently forced to rely on their own wits to survive, the desperate siblings fell back on petty crime, eventually befriending adorable yet feisty young Latika as they sought out food and shelter on the unforgiving streets of Mumbai. Though life on the streets was never easy, Jamal's experiences ultimately instilled in him the knowledge he needed to answer the tough questions posed to him on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. And though Jamal makes a convincing case for himself, one question still remains: why would a young man with no apparent desire for wealth or fame be so determined to win big on a national game show? Of course, it won't be long until everyone finds out the answer to this burning question, because as Jamal sits down to find out whether he will be rich beyond his wildest dreams, 60 million viewers remain transfixed to their televisions eager to see if he'll correctly answer the final question(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This fourth TV movie inspired by the classic, long-running mystery series Murder, She Wrote is also the first based on a novel, namely Lyn Hamilton's The Celtic Riddle. Angela Lansbury recreates her role as mystery writer-cum-amateur sleuth Jessica B. Fletcher, who on this occasion has journeyed to Ireland, there to attend the reading of the will of an old friend. Naturally, the bequeathing is chock-full of bizarre conditions and codicils, but the reading itself takes second place to the series of murders which follow. The police do their usual "thorough" investigation and come up with nothing, leaving it to Jessica to assemble the clues, many of which are maddeningly cryptic, and all of which are somehow linked to a huge hidden treasure. Filmed on location, Murder, She Wrote: The Celtic Riddle first aired May 9, 2003, on CBS(n)</desc>

Sarah Michelle Geller plays Kathryn, a beautiful but cold-hearted and manipulative young woman who enjoys making wagers with her jaded step-brother Sebastian (Ryan Phillippe). When Kathryn's boyfriend breaks off with her because he's infatuated with the less worldly Cecile (Selma Blair), Kathryn challenges Sebastian to seduce Cecile in order to ruin her new love. Sebastian reluctantly agrees, but is far more intrigued with a newer challenge -- Annette (Reese Witherspoon), the daughter of his private school's headmaster, who is intelligent, beautiful and has appeared in "Seventeen" magazine proudly announcing she intends to remain a virgin until the day she's married. Katheryn and Sebastian make a new bet: if he can bed Annette before the end of summer vacation, Katheryn will spend a debauched evening with him, but if he fails, she'll take ownership of his prized 1956 Jaguar.

    <desc lang="en">Stephen McIvor presents a chance to see day two from the Trusts Arena in New Zealand, featuring the quarter-finals. Both Michael van Gerwen and Phil Taylor were defeated at this stage last year, losing to James Wade and Adrian Lewis respectively. Reigning world champion van Gerwen is not taking part this time around, while Taylor is in his farewell season as a professional. The Power is showing no signs of slowing down, however, having recently wrapped up an incredible 16th World Matchplay title in Blackpool, overcoming van Gerwen, Raymond van Barneveld, Adrian Lewis and Peter Wright in the process. With commentary by Stuart Pyke, Rod Harrington and Glen Larmer.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Royal House of Windsor</title>
    <desc lang="en">The royal documentary continues, charting the drama and intrigue of Prince Charles' love-life via intimate letters. In the 1970s, the Prince of Wales resolved to avoid repeating the mistakes of his great uncle, King Edward VIII, and sought advice on marriage from another great uncle - Lord Mountbatten. Taking the heir apparent under his wing, Mountbatten fashioned himself as kingmaker, and arranged a secret meeting in Paris, allowing Charles to meet his disgraced `Uncle David' in person. The prince developed a sympathetic view of the exiled king, and his example fails to stop Charles falling in love with an unsuitable woman, who ends up marrying one of her many past boyfriends. Returning to his first love, Camilla Parker Bowles - now a mother of two - stability continues to elude Charles, until pressure from all sides prompts him to turn his eye to Lady Diana Spencer.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Unfinished Song</title>
    <desc lang="en">A cantankerous retiree discovers an untapped gift while wrestling with the impending death of his beloved wife in this inspirational musical drama from director Paul Andrew Williams. Arthur (Terence Stamp) has shared a fruitful and enduring marriage with his wife Marion (Vanessa Redgrave) when he receives the devastating news that their days together are numbered. But while Marion's condition might be terminal, she chooses to take the diagnosis in stride, doing her best to cherish what remaining time she has with her husband. Meanwhile, Arthur's already dour attitude grows increasingly grim with each passing day. When the senior's choir that Marion sings in shows up at their window one stormy morning to serenade them with Stevie Wonder's "You Are the Sunshine of My Life," Arthur completely loses his cool and snaps at the well-intentioned crooners. His outlook worsens right alongside Marion's health, but when she asks him to be her substitute in the choir, he agrees in an attempt to make her smile. Little does Arthur realize that choir director Elizabeth (Gemma Arterton) favors teaching the group such nontraditional tunes as Motörhead's "Ace of Spades" rather than the tired glee-club standards. In time, something remarkable happens -- Arthur finds his voice and remembers how it feels to truly be alive in the moment. Christopher Eccleston co-stars(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This factual drama, based on Bill O'Reilly's best-selling book Killing Kennedy: The End of Camelot, marks the 50th anniversary of the assassination of President John F Kennedy. Starring Rob Lowe as President Kennedy, Ginnifer Goodwin as Jacqueline Kennedy, Will Rothhaar as Lee Harvey Oswald and Michelle Trachtenberg as Marina Oswald, the programme charts the highs and lows of two lives that would intersect and result in two horrific murders that stunned a nation and marked the end of an era. The film combines rare historical insights and archives with dramatic and emotionally engaging storytelling to recount how a sequence of gunshots in Dallas not only killed a beloved president, but also propelled the nation into the thick of the Vietnam War and a cultural change(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">The One with Two Parts</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The One with Two Parts. Part two of The One with the Two Parts is a hospital farce. Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) has to go to a doctor, but has no insurance. To alleviate the problem, Monica (Courteney Cox) and Rachel switch identities so that Rachel can use Monica's coverage. Complications ensue when the two become attracted to their doctors (guest stars George Clooney and Noah Wyle). Asked out on dates by the cute practitioners, Monica and Rachel begin to bicker over who will date who -- listing each other's worst attributes in front of the doctors. Meanwhile, Joey (Matt LeBlanc) and Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) are not getting along because Joey is still dating Phoebe's twin sister, Ursula, forgetting Phoebe's birthday -- despite the fact that the identical siblings share the same birthday. Finally, Ross (David Schwimmer) is still afraid of being a father until Marcel the Monkey swallows some Scrabble tiles and Ross has to rush him to the hospital. His ability to take care of Marcel convinces him that he can handle fatherhood. This episode originally aired on February 23, 1995(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">David Attenborough's Galapagos</title>
    <sub-title lang="en">Origin.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The broadcaster explores the Galapagos, a collection of volcanic islands in the Pacific known for its extraordinary wildlife. More than 150 years after Charles Darwin formulated his ground-breaking theory of evolution on the remote archipelago, Attenborough explains how life on the islands has continued to evolve in biological isolation, examining how the ever-changing volcanic landscape has given birth to species and sub-species that exist nowhere else in the world. He begins by revealing how Galapagos rose from the ocean four million years ago.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Tyler Perry's Diary of a Mad Black Woman</title>
    <desc lang="en">A woman has to learn how to love and trust men all over again in this comedy drama. Helen McCarter (Kimberly Elise) would seem to have it all -- she's been married for 18 years to Charles (Steve Harris), and over the course of their time together, he's become one of Atlanta's most successful attorneys. But despite wealth and prestige, things are not as they should be at the McCarter home, and on their anniversary, Charles drops a bombshell on Helen -- he's divorcing her for another woman. Escorted out of the house with nowhere to go, Helen moves in with her grandmother Madea (Tyler Perry), a sassy woman with no shortage of opinions and a gun that she's not afraid to use. As Madea helps Helen get back on her feet emotionally, the divorcée makes the acquaintance of Orlando (Shemar Moore), a handsome man who is obviously attracted to her. But after her experiences with Charles, Helen isn't sure if she's ready to trust a man again. Diary of a Mad Black Woman was adapted from the popular stage play by Tyler Perry, who also plays several roles in the film, most prominently Madea; it marked the first feature-film credit for successful music video director Darren R. Grant(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A woman has to learn how to love and trust men all over again in this comedy drama. Helen McCarter (Kimberly Elise) would seem to have it all -- she's been married for 18 years to Charles (Steve Harris), and over the course of their time together, he's become one of Atlanta's most successful attorneys. But despite wealth and prestige, things are not as they should be at the McCarter home, and on their anniversary, Charles drops a bombshell on Helen -- he's divorcing her for another woman. Escorted out of the house with nowhere to go, Helen moves in with her grandmother Madea (Tyler Perry), a sassy woman with no shortage of opinions and a gun that she's not afraid to use. As Madea helps Helen get back on her feet emotionally, the divorcée makes the acquaintance of Orlando (Shemar Moore), a handsome man who is obviously attracted to her. But after her experiences with Charles, Helen isn't sure if she's ready to trust a man again. Diary of a Mad Black Woman was adapted from the popular stage play by Tyler Perry, who also plays several roles in the film, most prominently Madea; it marked the first feature-film credit for successful music video director Darren R.

    <desc lang="en">Bill Condon's thriller The Fifth Estate charts the creation of WikiLeaks by the ambitious and arguably ethically dubious Julian Assange, played by Benedict Cumberbatch. The movie opens with Assange hiring Daniel Domscheit-Berg (Daniel Brühl), a fellow tech whiz, to help him keep his new website operational. The site gave whistleblowers an entirely anonymous platform to share classified documents, and soon the pair find themselves in possession of information that will bring down a corrupt bank. As their power and influence grows, they must consider teaming with established media sources, especially when they are sent documents that would reveal ultra-sensitive state secrets from some of the world's most-powerful governments. The Fifth Estate screened at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival(n)</desc>

Garber is languishing on duty as a train dispatcher when all hell breaks loose after one of the Lexington Avenue line trains is hijacked by a gang led by the supremely self-assured, calmly ruthless Ryder. Ryder issues a demand for $10m and makes it clear that he won't hesitate to kill anyone who gets in his way. Garber and NYPD hostage negotiator Lieutenant Camonetti attempt to get to grips with the crisis but, as events progress, suspicions arise as to whether there's more to the hijacking than first meets the eye. Also starring James Gandolfini as New York's mayor and Luis Guzmán as a disgruntled subway worker who has joined Ryder's gang(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Kung Fu Hustle</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Stephen Chow made his name in this country with the deliriously wonderful Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle continues his love of comedy kung-fu films. Set in pre-revolutionary China, Chow plays Sing, a street hustler who makes the mistake of pretending to be a member of the notorious Axe gang. He becomes caught up in a war between the gang and the residents of Pig Sty Alley, which the gang want to take over. Little do they know that two of the Alley's residents are retired martial arts experts and soon the fists and feet are flying in knockabout fights that owe as much to Kill Bill (some of the wire work is done by Yuen Wo Ping, who worked on Tarantino's film) as they do to classic Hollywood silent comedies. Film fans can enjoy Chow's references to films ranging from Top Hat to The Shining while the rest can just enjoy a wildly entertaining romp. In Cantonese with English subtitles(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">After making a striking directorial debut with her screen adaptation of The Virgin Suicides, Sofia Coppola offers a story of love and friendship blooming under unlikely circumstances in this comedy drama. Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is a well-known American actor whose career has gone into a tailspin; needing work, he takes a very large fee to appear in a commercial for Japanese whiskey to be shot in Tokyo. Feeling no small degree of culture shock in Japan, Bob spends most of his non-working hours at his hotel, where he meets Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) at the bar. Twentysomething Charlotte is married to John (Giovanni Ribisi), a successful photographer who is in Tokyo on an assignment, leaving her to while away her time while he works. Beyond their shared bemusement and confusion with the sights and sounds of contemporary Tokyo, Bob and Charlotte share a similar dissatisfaction with their lives; the spark has gone out of Bob's marriage, and he's become disillusioned with his career. Meanwhile, Charlotte is puzzled with how much John has changed in their two years of marriage, while she's been unable to launch a creative career of her own. Bob and Charlotte become fast friends, and as they explore Tokyo, they begin to wonder if their sudden friendship might be growing into something more(n)</desc>

Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is a well-known American actor whose career has gone into a tailspin; needing work, he takes a very large fee to appear in a commercial for Japanese whiskey to be shot in Tokyo. Feeling no small degree of culture shock in Japan, Bob spends most of his non-working hours at his hotel, where he meets Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) at the bar. Twentysomething Charlotte is married to John (Giovanni Ribisi), a successful photographer who is in Tokyo on an assignment, leaving her to while away her time while he works. Beyond their shared bemusement and confusion with the sights and sounds of contemporary Tokyo, Bob and Charlotte share a similar dissatisfaction with their lives; the spark has gone out of Bob's marriage, and he's become disillusioned with his career. Meanwhile, Charlotte is puzzled with how much John has changed in their two years of marriage, while she's been unable to launch a creative career of her own. Bob and Charlotte become fast friends, and as they explore Tokyo, they begin to wonder if their sudden friendship might be growing into something more(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Kristin Stewart and Dakota Fanning star in Floria Sigismondi's rock biopic, based on Cherie Curie's autobiographical account. It's the mid-1970s and Southern Californian teen Joan Larkin has changed her name to Joan Jett. Along with her new dark, edgy identity comes a nascent desire: to create an all-girl rock band. Joan and her aggressive manager Kim Fowley stumble across the perfect face for the band: the 15-year-old blonde bombshell Cherie Curie. The two girls become close, with Cherie's sweet melodies slickly harmonising with Joan's electrifying guitar solos to great effect. They name themselves The Runaways and, after recruiting a lead guitarist and a bass player, are soon signed to Mercury Records, plunging them into the deep end of 70s rock excess. The success of their first album is massive. But, after a concert in Japan, the rest of the band discover magazines that feature only pictures of Cherie inside them - and are furious that they've been left out. Cherie begins to crumble under the pressures of being the face of the band, and starts to find solace in alcohol and drugs. As the band's stability disintegrates, can the girls rediscover the fun, runaway rock and roll lifestyle they sought?(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Redbelt</title>
    <desc lang="en">Tim Allen and Chiwetel Ejiofor co-star in writer/director David Mamet's martial arts drama Redbelt. Ejiofor plays Mike Terry, a jujitsu master who co-runs a very modest martial arts studio in Los Angeles with his bossy wife, Sondra (Alice Braga). Mike demonstrates an unwavering commitment to his craft and draws a cadre of defiantly loyal pupils including Joe (Max Martini), an LAPD cop. All told, it appears that he has chosen a peaceful and conflict-free path in life. The dedicated martial artist's fate takes an unanticipated turn, however, one evening when a young woman named Laura (Emily Mortimer) bursts into the academy in a state of near hysteria, and reaches for a policeman's gun when he tries to restrain her. One thing leads to another, and before long, Laura is regularly receiving martial arts lessons from Mike. As master begins to teach pupil and his martial arts philosophies emerge, his path also crisscrosses with that of a Hollywood movie star, Chet Frank (Tim Allen), when he saves the fellow from a beating at a local club and gets invited (along with Sondra) to Chet's house for dinner. Chet extends gestures of friendship, and Mike's guard breaks down; he speaks openly and candidly of a special martial arts method he employs that requires one of the participants to "assume a handicap." In time, the association with Chet leads to involvement in the motion-picture industry, and relations with a bevy of characters who aren't exactly what they seem -- including a pay-per-view fight mogul (Ricky Jay) and Chet's slimy and manipulative manager (Joe Mantegna)(n)</desc>

The Event Horizon mysteriously disappears in the midst of a mission with no trace of either the ship or its crew, but it reappears in Neptune's orbit after a seven year absence and it's sending out a distress signal. The spaceship Lewis and Clark, and Dr. Weir, are sent to investigate; the crew -- Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne), pilot Smith (Sean Pertwee), engineer Justin (Jack Noseworthy), navigator Starck (Joely Richardson), physician D.J. (Jason Isaacs), and emergency technicians Peters (Kathleen Quinlan) and Cooper (Richard T. Jones) -- are already tired and unenthusiastic about this assignment, and somewhat confused by Weir's reports. The crew of the Lewis and Clark are convinced that Weir is not telling them something, and when they discover the Event Horizon, they find that things are not what they seem, and an evil presence has taken over the ship. Incidentally, the term "event horizon" describes the outer boundaries of a black hole(n)</desc>

She is further amazed when, peering into the window of a passing bus, she spots a young woman who looks exactly like her. Figuring that Millicent is a mental case, Paul Grinstead (Martin Milner) humors her until the men in the white coats show up -- only to find out that the girl was telling the truth all along. A neat "matte shot" caps this eerie Rod Serling-scripted entry, based, believe it or not, on one of Serling's real-life experiences. First telecast February 26, 1960, "Mirror Image" was the 26th Twilight Zone episode to be filmed, but the 21st to be shown(n)</desc>

Two years ago, a pair of thirty foot-long prehistoric crocodiles terrorized the residents of Lake Placid. While most of the locals assumed that the nightmare had ended when the murderous creatures were killed, local crocodile lover Sadie (Cloris Leachman) knows that the truth is far more terrifying. Beneath the surface of Lake Placid, the remaining predators have been quietly reproducing, awaiting the moment they will emerge from the water and cement their status on the top of the food chain. Now, as Sheriff Riley's rebellious teenage son (Shad Collins) departs for a relaxing lakeside camping trip, the desperate father realizes the danger that lies beneath the surface and races to confront a prehistoric predator that won't stop until it's consumed every last local(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Immaturity and poor sportsmanship once again find their firmly established place in children's athletics (at least among the adults) in this sports comedy. Phil Weston (Will Ferrell) is a tightly wound suburban father who had a competitive streak worn into him by his father, Buck (Robert Duvall), who never seemed to feel that his son measured up. When Phil's son joins a Little League soccer team, Phil signs on as coach, only to learn that Buck -- who also has a ten-year-old son these days -- will be coaching a team in the same league. Determined to show his father he can do the job, Phil impresses upon his young charges that winning is the only important thing, and soon gains a few enemies as he humiliates not only the kids on his own team, but their opponents as well. Directed by Jesse Dylan, Kicking &amp; Screaming also features Kate Walsh and legendary football coach Mike Ditka. The screenplay was authored by Steve Rudnick and Leo Benvenuti (The Santa Clause) prior to the latter's death in 2000(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Kicking &amp; Screaming</title>
    <desc lang="en">Immaturity and poor sportsmanship once again find their firmly established place in children's athletics (at least among the adults) in this sports comedy. Phil Weston (Will Ferrell) is a tightly wound suburban father who had a competitive streak worn into him by his father, Buck (Robert Duvall), who never seemed to feel that his son measured up. When Phil's son joins a Little League soccer team, Phil signs on as coach, only to learn that Buck -- who also has a ten-year-old son these days -- will be coaching a team in the same league. Determined to show his father he can do the job, Phil impresses upon his young charges that winning is the only important thing, and soon gains a few enemies as he humiliates not only the kids on his own team, but their opponents as well. Directed by Jesse Dylan, Kicking &amp; Screaming also features Kate Walsh and legendary football coach Mike Ditka. The screenplay was authored by Steve Rudnick and Leo Benvenuti (The Santa Clause) prior to the latter's death in 2000(n)</desc>

Ugly Naked Guy is moving out and Ross (David Schwimmer) wants his apartment. To gain an upper hand in a flurry of bids, Ross goes nude with him. Looking out their window, Joey notices that Ugly Naked Guy has a friend; a shocked Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) proclaims, "It's Naked Ross!" While checking out Ross' new apartment, Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) looks out the window and sees Monica and Chandler having sex. Deciding to use the information to play jokes on them, Phoebe begins making passes at Chandler. This leads to a flirting showdown between the two where they kiss and freak each other out. Soon everyone knows about Monica and Chandler except Ross, who eventually sees them kiss out of his new apartment's window. This episode originally aired on February 11, 1999(n)</desc>
