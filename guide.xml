Market Harborough is a sought-after location where people usually expect to sell quickly, but John and Jane's house has been on the market for almost a year.

In the village of Countesthorpe, recently divorced Elaine wants to move on from her family home, but the former police officer can't see why its tired and dated look is putting buyers off.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A structural engineer (Anthony Hopkins) and an ambitious young district attorney (Ryan Gosling) become locked in a deadly battle of wits when the former is found innocent in the attempted murder of his wife in director Gregory Hoblit's tense tale of courtroom mind games. Ted Crawford (Hopkins) is an engineer who lives with his wife, Jennifer (Embeth Davidtz), in the couple's lavish Southern California home. One day, after carefully planning out the details to ensure that there is no way he can be convicted of murder, Ted shoots his wife in a blatant attempt to kill the woman. When head hostage negotiator Rob Nunally (Billy Burke) arrives on the scene to speak with Ted, he is shocked to find that the victim of the shooting is in fact his longtime lover. Though Jennifer survives the trauma of being shot in the head at close range, she hovers comatose between life and death as star prosecutor Willy Beachum (Gosling) reluctantly accepts the case while preparing to leave the Los Angeles criminal court system behind for a more promising career at a posh private law firm. Though the DA (David Strathairn) vehemently resents Beachum's lofty plan for departure, the hotshot young lawyer remains convinced that he can expedite the apparently open-and-shut case and be on his way to greener pastures in one week's time at the very most. Beachum's swelling ego betrays him, however, as his future boss Nikki Gardner (Rosamund Pike) begins to turn up the heat and fracture mechanics specialist Ted chooses to represent himself at the trial knowing well that a career spent spotting structural flaws in aeronautical systems has instilled him with just the kind of argumentative skills needed to riddle the swaggering young lawyer's "foolproof" case with doubt(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Pilot. Currently enjoying huge critical success stateside, The Mindy Project comes from the pen of Emmy Award-nominated writer/ producer and New York Times best-selling author Mindy Kaling. Despite having a successful career as a skilled obstetrician/ gynaecologist, Mindy Lahiri (Kaling) is unlucky in love and desperately needs to get her personal life back on track before her friends and colleagues are forced to stage an intervention. Funny, impatient and politically incorrect, Mindy can quote every single romantic comedy starring Meg Ryan. She loves even the bad ones, because the girl always gets the guy. Mindy is determined to be more punctual, spend less money, lose weight and read more books - all in pursuit of becoming a well-rounded perfect woman who can meet and date the perfect guy. As Mindy attempts to meet a guy who passes her red flag test (no drug habits, no skinny jeans and no secret families, among other conditions), only time will tell if she gets her rom-com ending. In this first episode, Mindy makes a drunken toast at her ex-boyfriend's wedding, and resolves to turn her life around(n)</desc>

Charmed by the swaggering kids, he agrees to take a ride with them, but they give him a sedative and he awakens in a deserted mansion, taped to a chair with one of his fingers missing.

Charlie phones his lawyer Marty (Cliff De Young), who calls a henchman, Lono (Denis Leary), who investigates the kidnappings and gives Charlie enough information to start playing each of his inexperienced abductors against the others(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Menace. The Rise of Hitler follows the Führer's rise to power, which was as unforeseeable as it was catastrophic. This first episode follows his early years. A mediocre student pampered by his mother, a failed artist and a loner, Hitler shirked military service in 1913. But Germany's defeat in World War I turned him into a rabid nationalist who soon became the mouthpiece of a small far-right group. When galloping inflation overtook Germany in 1924, he attempted a coup with his paramilitary Storm Troopers, but it was a terrible failure. Lucky to survive, Hitler was imprisoned and wrote Mein Kampf in his cell. When he was released he restarted his quest for power, this time by legal means. But the Germans weren't worried; they still thought Hitler was just an irrelevant deluded crank on the margins of German politics..(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The quarter-finals arrive, and only five contestants remain in the tent, and as the stakes get ever higher for the amateur bakers, Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins introduce yet another new Bake Off challenge - Tudor Week. All three tasks this week revolve around baking practices from the time of Henry VIII, beginning with a signature bake in the form of savoury-stuffed pies. In the technical heat, the contenders are asked to prepare unusual knotted Tudor biscuits, while the showstopper takes the form of a marzipan spectacle fit to grace a banquet tables at court. Plus, Sue Perkins visits Hampton Court to discover how a sweet delicacy nearly tempted the Virgin Queen Elizabeth I to marry.(n)</desc>

However, Jose Mourinho had a good record against Liverpool while manager of Chelsea, and will have been keen to come away with a victory that would put the clubs level on points. Plus, action from Sunday's fixtures - Middlesbrough v Watford at the Riverside Stadium and Southampton v Burnley at St Mary's Stadium.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Richard Hammond presents this chilly version of Total Wipeout, which sees the contestants wrapping up warm to tackle a snow-covered course with winter-themed obstacles and seasonal challenges. They must manoeuvre themselves past Granny's House, watching out for the angry dog nipping at their ankles and a front door guaranteed to smack them in the face. They then cling onto the ski lift to avoid plunging into the icy waters, before riding the conveyor belt that throws them onto those old Wipeout favourites, the big red balls. Amanda Byram laughs it up at the side of the course.(n)</desc>

In Essex, a young man tells Del and Dael his debtor father is currently out of the country, despite being in the company of an older man who seems suspiciously well-informed about the debt. Del then accompanies Brian to South London, where they plan to recover £10,000 from a man who acted as a guarantor on his friend's rent. A valuable car parked at their target's home seems to cover the debt, but the debtor's daughter engages the pair in a bizarre stand-off in order to save her father's precious vehicle.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Tropic Thunder</title>
    <desc lang="en">Ben Stiller's satirical look at Hollywood, Tropic Thunder concerns the production of an epic Vietnam War film that quickly derails thanks to the giant egos of everyone involved in the production. Stiller stars as Tugg Speedman, an action hero trying to segue out of that genre. Jack Black plays Jeff Portnoy, a drug-addicted fat comic also attempting to change his image by taking on such a serious film. They star alongside Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.), one of the world's most awarded actors, and a man who insists on immersing himself totally in a role. In this case, that means Lazarus has had his skin dyed in order to portray an African-American soldier. After their outrageous behavior lands the film's director, Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan), in very hot water with producer Les Grossman (Tom Cruise), Cockburn takes the advice of grizzled Vietnam vet Four Leaf Tayback (Nick Nolte); in order to gain control of his performers, Cockburn drops the actors off in the jungle, planning to film the movie guerrilla-style with hidden cameras. When the group stumbles upon a heroin production camp, the actors are unaware that they are in very real danger(n)</desc>

Hear from the prosecutors who have made their capture a full-time job and the historians who will explain why the Genovese will never die(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In the third installment of the series that began with The Prophecy, the Angel Gabriel (Christopher Walken) has taken up residence on Earth, where he's learned to enjoy the simple pleasures of life among humans, such as frosted doughnuts and driving a convertible. One night, he witnesses Danyael (Dave Buzzotta), a heretic preacher with a storefront church who tells his flock that God doesn't care much for the people who tend the Earth. A blind man (Brad Dourif) who claims to hear the voice of God shoots Danyael several times in the chest. However, several hours after he's pronounced dead, Danyael rises from his slab at the morgue and heads out into the street. Maggie (Kayren Ann Butler), his understandably upset girlfriend, is then approached by Zouhael (Vincent Spano), a fallen angel who needs Danyael for his own evil purposes. It seems that Danyael is half human and half angel, and both Gabriel and Zouhael want his help. A Spirit of genocide and destruction is about to rise on a Native American reservation, and if Gabriel is going to stop it -- or Zouhael is going to bring it forward -- they will need Danyael's guidance. Prophecy 3: The Ascent marked the directorial debut of Patrick Lussier, who has often worked as an editor for horror director Wes Craven(n)</desc>

Justin Chambers stars as D'Artagnan, a country-bred lad whose skill with a sword has led to aspirations of becoming a Musketeer, one of the French king's elite guard. Upon arriving in Paris, however, he finds that the Musketeers have been disbanded by order of Cardinal Richelieu (Stephen Rea), who is usurping the king's authority with the help of a lethally gifted henchman, Febre (Tim Roth). Soon, D'Artagnan is embroiled in an effort to prevent a war between his native country and England, meeting up with a beautiful love interest (Mena Suvari) along the way.

    <title lang="en">Racing With the Moon</title>
    <desc lang="en">Sean Penn graduated to full stardom with the 1984 drama Racing with the Moon, even though the film itself hardly set new box office records. Set in the early years of World War II, the film stars Penn as a small-town teen-aged hotshot, six weeks away from being shipped out to fight overseas. In the meantime, Penn begins to date Elizabeth McGovern, whom he assumes is from a wealthy family. Penn's pal Nicolas Cage, who's gotten his girlfriend Suzanne Adkinson pregnant, imposes upon Penn to hit up McGovern for the abortion money. That's when Penn discovers that the girl barely has a penny to her name. Convinced that Penn cared for her only when he thought she was rich, McGovern walks out on him, but later teams up with Penn to help the unfortunate Adkinson. The plot is pure James Dean, a fact not lost on fans who regarded Sean Penn as the second coming of Dean. A very slight piece, Racing With the Moon is buoyed by the engaging performances of the stars, and by director Richard Benjamin's meticulous attention to period detail-especially in those peerless bowling-alley and skating-rink sequences(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Noah</title>
    <desc lang="en">Darren Aronofsky brings the story of Noah's Ark to the big screen with this Paramount/New Regency production. "In the beginning, there was nothing." So starts this version of the story centered on Noah (Russell Crowe), the man entrusted by God to save the innocent animals of Earth as the rising floodwaters cleansed the planet of mankind's evil. As the telling continues, we learn how Adam and Eve's sins have passed down through generations through their sons Cain and Abel, and how the descendants of their righteous sibling Seth were entrusted with defending creation. One day, while foraging in the country, a descendant of Seth, Noah, sees his father slain by a descendant of Cain. In the process, Noah's birthright is stolen from him. Decades later, as a father of three, Noah experiences a vision foretelling the great flood that will wash over the Earth, destroying every living thing that stands on the soil. That vision leads Noah to seek out his grandfather, Methuselah, in order to understand his mission. When a second vision reveals that Noah is to construct a massive ark designed to shelter every living animal during the great flood, Noah, his wife Naameh (Jennifer Connelly), their three sons Shem (Douglas Booth), Ham (Logan Lerman), and Japheth (Leo McHugh Carroll), and their adoptive sister Ila (Emma Watson) immediately begin construction on the vessel with the help of the Watchers, a race of angels created as beings of light, but encrusted in stone and mud and forsaken by God for their attempts to help man. Meanwhile, word of Noah's work soon reaches Tubal Cain (Ray Winstone), who gathers an army on a mission to overtake the ark, and survive the coming storm by any cost(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">District 9</title>
    <desc lang="en">Neill Blomkamp's debut feature is a thoughtful sci-fi thriller about aliens stranded on Earth, which tells a social parable that couldn't be more apposite to its South African setting. Back in the early 80s a spaceship grinds to a halt above Johannesburg. On investigation, the colossal craft is found to house insect-like bipeds, all in a very bad shape. Eventually allowed to land on the planet, the occupants are confined to District 9, a shabby outlying suburb. Now, around 20 years later, the entire population of 'prawns', as the aliens have offensively been labelled, are to be moved to a distant detention camp, with Afrikaner bureaucrat Wikus van de Merwe placed in charge of their relocation. But when a grim accident befalls van de Merwe, he's given a radically different perspective on the affair, as well as little choice but to team up with the extra-terrestrials. Mixing elements of horror and action-thriller into the allegorical whole, the Oscar- and BAFTA-nominated fantasy, produced by Peter Jackson, uses top-notch CGI to both create a believable setting and to move the pace along nicely. In English, with subtitles for the dialogue in Afrikaans, Nyanja, Zulu, Xhosa, Sotho and the aliens' language(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Noah</title>
    <desc lang="en">Darren Aronofsky brings the story of Noah's Ark to the big screen with this Paramount/New Regency production. "In the beginning, there was nothing." So starts this version of the story centered on Noah (Russell Crowe), the man entrusted by God to save the innocent animals of Earth as the rising floodwaters cleansed the planet of mankind's evil. As the telling continues, we learn how Adam and Eve's sins have passed down through generations through their sons Cain and Abel, and how the descendants of their righteous sibling Seth were entrusted with defending creation. One day, while foraging in the country, a descendant of Seth, Noah, sees his father slain by a descendant of Cain. In the process, Noah's birthright is stolen from him. Decades later, as a father of three, Noah experiences a vision foretelling the great flood that will wash over the Earth, destroying every living thing that stands on the soil. That vision leads Noah to seek out his grandfather, Methuselah, in order to understand his mission. When a second vision reveals that Noah is to construct a massive ark designed to shelter every living animal during the great flood, Noah, his wife Naameh (Jennifer Connelly), their three sons Shem (Douglas Booth), Ham (Logan Lerman), and Japheth (Leo McHugh Carroll), and their adoptive sister Ila (Emma Watson) immediately begin construction on the vessel with the help of the Watchers, a race of angels created as beings of light, but encrusted in stone and mud and forsaken by God for their attempts to help man. Meanwhile, word of Noah's work soon reaches Tubal Cain (Ray Winstone), who gathers an army on a mission to overtake the ark, and survive the coming storm by any cost(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Radioactive Man. Hollywood moguls and comic book fans everywhere are abuzz over the news that Radioactive Man is to be adapted into a major motion picture, and observers are surprised by two bits of news concerning the project -- Teutonic action star Rainier Wolfcastle (voice of Harry Shearer) has been cast in the title role, and the producers have chosen to shoot the entire film on location in Springfield. Bart Simpson (voice of Nancy Cartwright), an ardent Radioactive Man fan, hears there will be an open call to find a young actor to play youthful sidekick "Fallout Boy," and considers himself a cinch to win the role. However, the part instead goes to Bart's close friend Milhouse (voice of Pamela Hayden), who isn't even certain he wants it. Milhouse's dissatisfaction with his new stardom grows, and one day he disappears; Bart sets out to find him and convince him not to pass up the chance of a lifetime. Meanwhile, Mayor Quimby (voice of Dan Castellaneta) busies himself by creating a wide variety of new taxes to levy against the film's production team. "Radioactive Man" also features a cameo by Mickey Rooney, who plays himself trying to convince Milhouse to finish the film; the episode first aired on September 24, 1995(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A clerical error tests the lifelong friendship of two brides-to-be by scheduling their respective weddings at the famed Plaza Hotel on the exact same date in this romantic comedy starring Anne Hathaway and Kate Hudson. Ever since they were little girls, Liv (Hudson) and Emma (Hathaway) have bonded over planning their weddings down to the very last detail. Now, both in their mid-twenties, Liv and Emma have each found the men they want to spend the rest of their lives with. But while most of the details regarding their respective weddings don't overlap, the one thing that both Liv and Emma have always dreamt of is holding their ceremony at the legendary Plaza Hotel -- New Your City's ultimate bridal destination. Unfortunately, a simple clerical error has scheduled both of their weddings on the exact same date, at the exact same place. As a high-powered lawyer who's used to getting her way, Liv simply isn't willing to settle for anything less than perfection. And though simple schoolteacher Emma has always placed the needs of others above her own, the prospect of making any sacrifices on her big day brings out her inner bridezilla in ways that shock her unsuspecting friends and family. There was a time when Liv and Emma would have done anything for each other, but now that the two best friends are at odds over who will get their dream wedding and who will have to settle for second best, the lacy gloves are off and it's all-out war(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A clerical error tests the lifelong friendship of two brides-to-be by scheduling their respective weddings at the famed Plaza Hotel on the exact same date in this romantic comedy starring Anne Hathaway and Kate Hudson. Ever since they were little girls, Liv (Hudson) and Emma (Hathaway) have bonded over planning their weddings down to the very last detail. Now, both in their mid-twenties, Liv and Emma have each found the men they want to spend the rest of their lives with. But while most of the details regarding their respective weddings don't overlap, the one thing that both Liv and Emma have always dreamt of is holding their ceremony at the legendary Plaza Hotel -- New Your City's ultimate bridal destination. Unfortunately, a simple clerical error has scheduled both of their weddings on the exact same date, at the exact same place. As a high-powered lawyer who's used to getting her way, Liv simply isn't willing to settle for anything less than perfection. And though simple schoolteacher Emma has always placed the needs of others above her own, the prospect of making any sacrifices on her big day brings out her inner bridezilla in ways that shock her unsuspecting friends and family. There was a time when Liv and Emma would have done anything for each other, but now that the two best friends are at odds over who will get their dream wedding and who will have to settle for second best, the lacy gloves are off and it's all-out war(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Georgia Rule</title>
    <desc lang="en">Jane Fonda, Felicity Huffman, and Lindsay Lohan star in director Garry Marshall's tale of a rebellious young woman who is sent to spend the summer with her grandmother when her frustrated mother fails to find a means of curbing her unruly behavior. Rachel (Lohan) is an out-of-control teen whose reckless drinking, foul mouth, and hysterical fits have become a constant source of embarrassment for her long-suffering mother, Lily (Huffman). When Rachel crashes her car, Lily determines that the only way to tame her savage daughter is to take her as far away from San Francisco as possible. Though Lily had once sworn never to return to the Idaho farm presided over by her demanding mother, Georgia (Jane Fonda), desperation has a funny way of dulling the pains of the past, and it's not long before Lily is packing Rachel in the car and setting out for potato country. Contrary to the common image of the sweet and doting grandmother, Georgia is a stern matriarch whose beliefs in the power of God and a hard day's work stand in stark contrast to the carefree lifestyle of the tempestuous Rachel. An interesting thing happens as the summer wears on, though; despite her initial efforts to disrupt the quiet Mormon community, Rachel's rage is gradually tempered as she learns the value of structure and responsibility. Later, as Rachel's protective walls begin to crumble and she begins to embrace compassion and kindness, the doors are opened for three generations of family to confront the long-buried secrets of their past and finally move forward in the healing process(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Georgia Rule</title>
    <desc lang="en">Jane Fonda, Felicity Huffman, and Lindsay Lohan star in director Garry Marshall's tale of a rebellious young woman who is sent to spend the summer with her grandmother when her frustrated mother fails to find a means of curbing her unruly behavior. Rachel (Lohan) is an out-of-control teen whose reckless drinking, foul mouth, and hysterical fits have become a constant source of embarrassment for her long-suffering mother, Lily (Huffman). When Rachel crashes her car, Lily determines that the only way to tame her savage daughter is to take her as far away from San Francisco as possible. Though Lily had once sworn never to return to the Idaho farm presided over by her demanding mother, Georgia (Jane Fonda), desperation has a funny way of dulling the pains of the past, and it's not long before Lily is packing Rachel in the car and setting out for potato country. Contrary to the common image of the sweet and doting grandmother, Georgia is a stern matriarch whose beliefs in the power of God and a hard day's work stand in stark contrast to the carefree lifestyle of the tempestuous Rachel. An interesting thing happens as the summer wears on, though; despite her initial efforts to disrupt the quiet Mormon community, Rachel's rage is gradually tempered as she learns the value of structure and responsibility. Later, as Rachel's protective walls begin to crumble and she begins to embrace compassion and kindness, the doors are opened for three generations of family to confront the long-buried secrets of their past and finally move forward in the healing process(n)</desc>

The setting is Los Angeles, CA, and the event is the wedding between a man and a woman who always seemed destined to be together.

A free-spirited soul who has experienced flings with a variety of wedding attendees including the hapless Pockets (Jon Abrahams), alcoholic actor Simon (James Van Der Beek), and manic children's television program host Donovan (Ethan Embry), Lana attempts to sort out her past flings as lovelorn agent Quentin (Colin Hanks) pines for the bride's sister and the estranged father of the groom attempts to reconnect with his long-lost son(n)</desc>

One day he is sold to a neighbor, where he meets a sheep who warns him that his fate lies in the confines of the slaughterhouse. Wilbur is terrified of this news until he meets Charlotte, a charming spider (voice of Debbie Reynolds), who is determined to save Wilbur from this dire destiny. By weaving words into her web, she convinces the farmer that Wilbur is some sort of prodigious animal too important to kill. The music for Charlotte's Web was written by Richard M.

    <title lang="en">Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron</title>
    <desc lang="en">Screenwriter John Fusco returns to the Western themes of his previous films Young Guns and Thunderheart with this animated children's adventure from Dreamworks. Matt Damon supplies the voice of Spirit, a wild Mustang stallion living free in the Old West of the late 19th century, where he's captured by human horse traders and sold to a cavalry regiment at a frontier outpost. There, a cruel colonel (voice of James Cromwell) nearly succeeds in breaking the willful horse, but not quite. Spirit escapes in the company of another captive, Little Creek (voice of Daniel Studi), a Native American youth that tries to possess the magnificent animal by more humane means, but Spirit refuses to bend to human will even when he makes the acquaintance of Little Creek's beautiful and fiercely loyal mare, Rain. After he saves Little Creek's life in an Army raid, Spirit believes that the gravely injured Rain has perished after a tumble over a waterfall. Despondent, the horse is captured again by humans, enslaved this time for work in a pack team on the transcontinental railroad. Undaunted by the tragedies that befall him, Spirit manages to escape for a reunion with Little Creek, Rain, and his long-lost brethren. Featuring songs by rock singer Bryan Adams, Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron departs from other examples of its genre in that the horse protagonists do not speak or sing; only Spirit's voice is heard as voice-over narration(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Coraline</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Henry Selick (The Nightmare Before Christmas; James and the Giant Peach) delivers a deliciously dark stop-motion animated adventure for children who don't mind a scare or two, based on Neil Gaiman's much-praised book. Coraline Jones and her parents have just moved into the Pink Palaces Apartments in Oregon, where they find themselves surrounded by eccentric neighbours, including a pair of ageing burlesque performers. It should be an exciting time, but Coraline's parents are too busy working as horticultural journalists to spend any time with her, so she is deeply bored. That is until she discovers a mysterious door that only appears after dark. Bold and inquisitive, the youngster investigates. She discovers a brightly coloured alternative universe, where her 'Other Mother' has plenty of time to play with her and her neighbours' quirks are charmingly exaggerated; in fact, she's tempted to stay. But all is not as it seems: everyone in the new world has buttons for eyes - and the operation to install them involves knitting needles. And that revelation is just the first of her shocking discoveries about the true nature of her apparent idyll... So, there's definitely good reason for that PG certificate, though children who can cope with the story of Hansel and Gretel shouldn't find anything too disturbing here. Selick's film won great critical acclaim, and scooped festival prizes around the world, as well as picking up an Oscar nomination and winning the 2009 BAFTA Children's Award. Also featuring the voices of Keith David, Robert Bailey Jr and Ian McShane(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This blend of sports and youthful romantic comedy is from director Michael Tollin, who previously produced the sports drama Varsity Blues (1999). Freddie Prinze Jr. stars as Ryan Dunne, a ballplayer who's spending the summer as a pitcher for the famed, highly prestigious Cape Cod League, a non-professional farm team that has turned out numerous baseball legends. Ryan's under special pressure on a number of fronts. He's the first local boy to earn a slot in the league in years, and his blue-collar status earns him the enmity of a hot-shot college teammate, Eric Van Leemer (Corey Pearson). Although he's backed up by his best friend and team catcher Billy Brubaker (Matthew Lillard), Ryan adds more stress to his life by embarking on an affair with a beautiful, wealthy young Vassar graduate, Tenley Parrish (Jessica Biel), who's spending the summer on the Cape with her parents. Tenley is facing her own crisis as her father (Bruce Davison) pressures her to move to San Francisco and work with her uncle, though she'd rather remain in the East and become an architect. Summer Catch is the third onscreen teaming of Prinze and Lillard, and also stars Brian Dennehy, Wilmer Valderrama, Jason Gedrick, Fred Ward, and Brittany Murphy(n)</desc>

Dre (Taye Diggs) and Sidney (Sanaa Lathan) became best friends when they were ten years old -- the same time that both first became aware of the first rumblings of the Hip Hop revolution in New York City. Today, Dre runs a successful record label, and Sidney is a respected music journalist; both have managed to turn their love for the music into careers, and both are still close friends. Close enough, in fact, that many of their pals wonder why they've never become boyfriend and girlfriend. While both have always denied their attraction to one another, Sidney begins to have second thoughts when Dre proposes to his girlfriend Reese (Nicole Ari Parker), a lawyer. Even though Sidney has a relationship of her own with professional basketball player Kelby (Boris Kodjoe), as Dre's wedding draws closer, Sidney begins to suspect that her longtime best friend is actually the love of her life. Brown Sugar features supporting performances form real life Hip Hop stars Mos Def and Queen Latifah; former basketball star Earvin "Magic" Johnson served as executive producer(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Based on the 1999 bestseller by K.C. McKinnon, this touching Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation stars Alicia Silverstone as Dee Dee, a single mom and professional candlemaker who returns to her Maine hometown after a lengthy absence. Having left town with a somewhat sullied reputation, she returns with apparently the best of intentions--bringing her 12-year-old son Trooper (Matthew Knight) along for the sentimental journey. Dee Dee's reappearance is initially met with hostility by veterinarian Lydia, whose husband (and coworker) Sam had once been Dee Dee's sweetheart. Ultimately, however, Lydia warms up to both her "rival" and her son--just before Dee Dee poignantly reveals the real reason for her unexpected homecoming. Filmed for television on location in Nova Scotia, Candles on Bay Street was first broadcast by CBS on November 26, 2006(n)</desc>

Fueled by revenge and aided by his trusted weapons expert, Microchip (Wayne Knight), vigilante Frank Castle (Rome's Ray Stevenson) turns the New York City streets red with blood as he takes down each and every member of the crime syndicate responsible for the death of his wife and two kids. As the law-appointed "Punisher Task Force" closes in on him, the antihero does battle with Billy Russoti (Dominic West), aka Jigsaw, a nickname given by him to reflect the disfigurement handed to him by Castle. With the help of his psychotic brother, Loony Bin Jim (Doug Hutchison), Jigsaw recruits the criminals of the city to band together to bring down The Punisher, using the wife (played by Dexter's Julie Benz) and daughter of a slayed FBI agent as bait. Art Marcum, Matt Holloway, and Nick Santora provide the screenplay for the Lionsgate release(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Dennis Waterman and former Corrie actress Georgia Taylor guest star in this special festive edition of the popular rural drama. A retired mountaineer (Waterman) still grieving over his son's death in a climbing accident gets a pleasant surprise when his student daughter (Taylor) returns for the holidays. But an even bigger shock is yet to come - not only is she pregnant, but the father-to-be is the very man her dad blames for her brother's demise. Meanwhile, the local women grow fed up with their menfolk when they arrive back from a booze run the worse for drink, prompting them to hang up their aprons and hand over all the Christmas organisation to the fellas. Beth doesn't know what to think when a patient predicts the new year will bring her and Tom the joy they have longed for, and romance is in the air for David and Anna. Lesley Dunlop, Philip Middlemiss, Kerrie Taylor and Samantha Giles star.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Enough</title>
    <desc lang="en">Screenwriter Nicholas Kazan and director Michael Apted combine elements of the hit films Sleeping With the Enemy and Double Jeopardy in this domestic thriller starring actress and recording artist Jennifer Lopez. "J. Lo" stars as Slim, a working-class diner waitress who accepts a date with the dashing Mitch (Bill Campbell), a successful building contractor who warns her about the insincere attentions of another suitor. Swept off her feet by Mitch, Slim soon marries him and gives birth to a daughter, Gracie (Tessa Allen). Her new life of suburban privilege seems idyllic for a few years until Slim discovers that Mitch is a serial philanderer. After his abuse becomes physical, Slim first seeks refuge with a battered woman's group then creates a new identity in another city, but she soon learns that there is no hiding from the resourceful Mitch, who is always able to track her down. After receiving little help from the father (Fred Ward), who abandoned her years ago, or the unsympathetic legal system, Slim resorts to martial arts lessons and a calculated campaign of payback designed to rid her and Gracie of the violent Mitch's presence forever. Enough co-stars Juliette Lewis, Noah Wyle, and Dan Futterman(n)</desc>

Over four days, Tony heads out from the Victorian wool capital of Bradford and treks in a giant loop around what is now known as Bronte Country. From the birth of Charlotte, Emily, Anne and their brother Branwell in the suburb of Thornton, he traces their childhoods to the much-romanticised Bronte hub of Haworth, finding that the harsh reality of life in the 1820s was far removed from the fantasy world dreamed up by the children at their father's parsonage home.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Though the end of the United States Civil War gave the nation much to celebrate, there were nonetheless those unpleased with the North's victory, the key example, perhaps, being John Wilkes Booth. Eager to declare one definitive "victory" for the South, Booth shot and killed President Abraham Lincoln in front of thousands of witnesses. However, despite one of the largest manhunts in US history, Booth was able to evade capture for nearly two weeks. This program offers an in-depth look at exactly how Booth nearly escaped successfully after assassinating the President of the United States(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">On the evening of April 13, 1865, only days after Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox, a plot was finalized by Confederate zealot John Wilkes Booth and his co-conspirators to not only assassinate President Abraham Lincoln the following day, but to decapitate the government of the United States in the hopes that the Confederacy would rise from the ashes. KILLING LINCOLN is a two-hour special detailing that conspiracy, President Lincoln's final days after one of the bloodiest civil wars in history, and the manhunt to capture the first assassin of a U.S. President(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Notting Hill</title>
    <desc lang="en">Can a beautiful and internationally famous American actress find happiness with a frumpy British bookstore clerk? She can -- at least for a while, it seems -- in Notting Hill. William Thacker (played by Hugh Grant) is a bookseller at a shop in the Notting Hill district in West London, who shares a house with an eccentric Welsh friend, Spike (Rhys Ifans). One day, William is minding the store when in strolls Anna Scott (Julia Roberts), a lovely and well-known actress from the United States who is in London working on a film. She buys a book from William, and she is polite and charming in the way a famous actress would be with a star-struck sales clerk. Their relationship would logically end there, if William didn't run out a few minutes later to buy some juice. While dashing back to the shop, he bumps into Anna on the street, spilling juice all over her blouse. Since he lives nearby, William politely offers to let her stop by his house to clean up; since William seems harmless enough, Anna agrees. When Anna has to stop back to pick up a bag she left at William's house, they kiss -- just in time for Spike to show up. A romance slowly blooms as his friends and family (not to mention the world at large) wonder out loud what he's doing dating a movie star. Notting Hill reunites Hugh Grant with producer Duncan Kenworthy and screenwriter Richard Curtis, who previously worked together on the international hit Four Weddings And A Funeral(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Notting Hill</title>
    <desc lang="en">Can a beautiful and internationally famous American actress find happiness with a frumpy British bookstore clerk? She can -- at least for a while, it seems -- in Notting Hill. William Thacker (played by Hugh Grant) is a bookseller at a shop in the Notting Hill district in West London, who shares a house with an eccentric Welsh friend, Spike (Rhys Ifans). One day, William is minding the store when in strolls Anna Scott (Julia Roberts), a lovely and well-known actress from the United States who is in London working on a film. She buys a book from William, and she is polite and charming in the way a famous actress would be with a star-struck sales clerk. Their relationship would logically end there, if William didn't run out a few minutes later to buy some juice. While dashing back to the shop, he bumps into Anna on the street, spilling juice all over her blouse. Since he lives nearby, William politely offers to let her stop by his house to clean up; since William seems harmless enough, Anna agrees. When Anna has to stop back to pick up a bag she left at William's house, they kiss -- just in time for Spike to show up. A romance slowly blooms as his friends and family (not to mention the world at large) wonder out loud what he's doing dating a movie star. Notting Hill reunites Hugh Grant with producer Duncan Kenworthy and screenwriter Richard Curtis, who previously worked together on the international hit Four Weddings And A Funeral(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Shadow Zone: The Undead Express</title>
    <desc lang="en">A horror semi-parody targeted at the young adult market that ravenously gobbles up horror books like R.L. Stine's Goosebumps series, this made-for-TV vampire tale stars Chauncey Leopardi as Zach, a teenage rebel with a flair for telling ghost stories, who stumbles on an underground cabal of vampires when he takes a fateful ride on a New York subway. The vampire's leader, Valentine (Ron Silver), proposes a deal to young Zach, offering him safe passage to the world above, thus enabling the trapped vampire -- who can only mingle with humanity through the willing assistance of an innocent youth -- to reach the surface as well. Our young hero balks at this idea and escapes to the surface with a wild story for his skeptical pals, who shun him until one of their number is kidnapped by the undead subway dwellers in exchange for Zach's cooperation. Though atmospherically photographed, this low-budget production is a bit too corny to provide either laughs or chills, and it suffers further from lethargic pacing(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Hart's War</title>
    <desc lang="en">Based on the novel by John Katzenbach, author of Just Cause (1995), this prison camp drama combines elements of A Soldier's Story (1984) and the classic Stalag 17 (1953). Colin Farrell stars as Lt. Tommy Hart, a second-year Harvard Law School student who enlists to fight in World War II but ends up being taken prisoner by the Germans. When a murder at the Nazi-run Stalag Luft 13 leaves a black Tuskegee airman named Lt. Lincoln Scott (Terrence Dashon Howard) accused of the crime, high-ranking prisoner (and fourth-generation war hero) Col. William McNamara (Bruce Willis) persuades camp commandant Col. Werner Visser (Marcel Iures) to allow the prisoners to hold their own trial. Hart is recruited to defend his fellow officer, but as he reluctantly investigates, he discovers that not all of his fellow allied soldiers are fighting the same war and that his "client" may well have been framed. In the meantime, it becomes apparent that McNamara is using events to mask his true intent, a mission to destroy a nearby munitions plant that he still intends to carry out despite his incarceration. Hart's War (2002) co-stars Vicellous Shannon, Cole Hauser, Rory Cochrane, and Jonathan Brandis(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Hart's War</title>
    <desc lang="en">Based on the novel by John Katzenbach, author of Just Cause (1995), this prison camp drama combines elements of A Soldier's Story (1984) and the classic Stalag 17 (1953). Colin Farrell stars as Lt. Tommy Hart, a second-year Harvard Law School student who enlists to fight in World War II but ends up being taken prisoner by the Germans. When a murder at the Nazi-run Stalag Luft 13 leaves a black Tuskegee airman named Lt. Lincoln Scott (Terrence Dashon Howard) accused of the crime, high-ranking prisoner (and fourth-generation war hero) Col. William McNamara (Bruce Willis) persuades camp commandant Col. Werner Visser (Marcel Iures) to allow the prisoners to hold their own trial. Hart is recruited to defend his fellow officer, but as he reluctantly investigates, he discovers that not all of his fellow allied soldiers are fighting the same war and that his "client" may well have been framed. In the meantime, it becomes apparent that McNamara is using events to mask his true intent, a mission to destroy a nearby munitions plant that he still intends to carry out despite his incarceration. Hart's War (2002) co-stars Vicellous Shannon, Cole Hauser, Rory Cochrane, and Jonathan Brandis(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Gandhi</title>
    <desc lang="en">It was Richard Attenborough's lifelong dream to bring the life story of Indian political and spiritual leader Mahatma Gandhi to the screen. When it finally reached fruition in 1982, the 188-minute, Oscar-winning Gandhi was one of the most exhaustively thorough biopics ever made. The film begins in the early part of the 20th century, when Mohandas K. Gandhi (Ben Kingsley), a British-trained lawyer, forsakes all worldly possessions to take up the cause of Indian independence. Faced with armed resistance from the British government, Gandhi adopts a policy of "passive resistance," endeavoring to win freedom for his people without resorting to bloodshed. In the horrendous "slaughter" sequence, more extras appear on screen than in any previous historical epic. The supporting cast includes Candice Bergen as photographer Margaret Bourke-White, Athol Fugard as General Smuts, John Gielgud as Lord Irwin, John Mills as the viceroy, Martin Sheen as Walker, Trevor Howard as Judge Broomfield, and, in a tiny part as a street bully, star-to-be Daniel Day-Lewis. Gandhi won eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Director(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">"Revenge" is the watchword of this black comedy that takes a keen look at the self-centeredness, blind ambition, cynicism, and amoral behavior in modern-day Hollywood. Buddy is the control-freak Hollywood production executive with a reputation for abusing his employees. He is particularly abusive to his young personal assistant Guy, a recent film-school graduate and naive Hollywood newcomer. The idealistic young Guy is routinely humiliated by Buddy. Unable to stand anymore abuse and no longer the naive idealist, Guy turns on Buddy. He ends up tying him up and then subjecting Buddy to all the sadism, and torture Buddy inflicted on others. He threatens to do even worse, but is deterred by an unexpected arrival, whose presence leads to a surprising final plot twist. The film was first shown at Telluride Film Festival as The Buddy Factor but was retitled for its general release in 1995(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle director Stephen Chow returns to the helm for this sci-fi comedy about a struggling single father whose quest to find the perfect toy yields out-of-this-world results. Ti (Chow) is a poor construction worker who breaks his back to ensure that his young son Dicky (Xu Jiao) can stay enrolled in an exclusive private school. But while Ti does everything possible to give his son the opportunities that he never had, Dicky still feels like a classroom reject due to his tattered clothes and lack of the latest toys. Dicky's classmates all play with the coolest and most expensive gadgets that money can buy, so how is a kid who gets his toys from the local junkyard ever supposed to fit in? One day, while scrounging through the trash heap in search of a new toy, Ti discovers a mysterious orb and brings it straight back to Dicky. Though at first the "CJ7" appears to be little more than an unidentifiable oddity, it proves to be much, much more once the young boy starts to play with it. This isn't your average action figure, but a living "pet" with extraordinary powers. Realizing that his new toy may be just the thing to help him fit in with his demanding classmates, Dicky brings the CJ7 to school with him in order to show it off and have some fun. But the CJ7 has its own ideas about how to have fun, and it isn't long before the situation at school gets hopelessly out of hand(n)</desc>

In 48 hours, Doug is scheduled to walk down the aisle, effectively ending his reign as a rowdy bachelor. Realizing that this is their last blowout with their best friend, Doug's groomsmen organize a Sin City bachelor bash he'll never forget. The next morning, the groomsmen come to in their Caesar's Palace suite to find a tiger in the bathroom and a six-month-old baby tucked away in the closet. Unfortunately, Doug is nowhere to be found. With no memory of the previous night's transgressions and precious little time to spare, the trio sets out in a hazy attempt to retrace their steps and discover exactly where things went wrong. Will they find Doug in time to get him to the wedding back in Los Angeles, or will his bride experience the sharp sting of disappointment when she walks down the aisle to discover that her future husband is nowhere to be found? Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis, and Heather Graham star in a rambunctious comedy from Old School director Todd Phillips(n)</desc>
