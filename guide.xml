    <desc lang="en">Documentary catching up with London's Crossrail engineers less than two years after the project's excavations uncovered the 14th-century Charterhouse plague pit. In an extraordinary turn of events, further work on the Liverpool Street station has revealed another burial ground, this time accommodating the capital's radicals, rebels and outsiders. The Bedlam burial ground, which is thought to be the final resting place of nearly 20,000 people, was believed to be lost for around 300 years. Now, with the excavation process under way, archaeologists and historians have been using bone analysis techniques in conjunction with parish records to reveal the names and life stories of those whose remains were found on-site. Their research reveals that people came from as far afield as Africa to work in the English capital, and sheds light on how pollution first became one of the city's most prolific killers.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Death Defying Acts</title>
    <desc lang="en">My Brilliant Career and Oscar and Lucinda director Gillian Armstrong explores the final feat of the greatest illusionist ever to deceive a live audience in this docudrama concerning Harry Houdini's obsessive quest to find proof of an afterlife. The year is 1926, and Houdini (Guy Pearce) is an international superstar. Not only does the illusionist's otherworldly ability to bend reality hold audiences completely enthralled, but his easy charm finds him winning the hearts of his growing legion of fans as well. Yet behind Houdini's winning smile resides the restless heart of a tortured soul. Isolated by fame and drowning in regret over having not been present to hear his mother's last words, Houdini sets out in tour of Scotland and announces that he will pay 10,000 dollars to anyone who can prove spiritual contact with his deceased mother. But in his determination to prove that there is life after death, Houdini also becomes the target of countless charlatans, scam artists, and self-proclaimed spiritualists. Of course, stunning psychic Mary McGregor (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and her daughter/sidekick, Benji (Saoirse Ronan), seem remarkably sincere in their supernatural talents, yet that doesn't mean that the pair doesn't have their own ulterior motives for making a connection with the world-famous magic man(n)</desc>

When top airplane engineer Ted Crawford discovers that his wife has been cheating on him he takes a devastatingly direct route to revenge: he drives home and shoots his errant spouse in the face. He then waits for the police to turn up and confesses to the crime. With his wife in a coma, Crawford is arrested and enters the justice system. It should, of course, be the simplest prosecution ever.

Charmed by the swaggering kids, he agrees to take a ride with them, but they give him a sedative and he awakens in a deserted mansion, taped to a chair with one of his fingers missing. One of his abductors, Avery (Henry Thomas), says that he has a sister who has been kidnapped and they need two million dollars to get her back, as well as a finger to exchange for her severed digit. Charlie phones his lawyer Marty (Cliff De Young), who calls a henchman, Lono (Denis Leary), who investigates the kidnappings and gives Charlie enough information to start playing each of his inexperienced abductors against the others(n)</desc>

In the movie's opening sequence, he's eating at a New York restaurant when the gorgeous Jess approaches his table and asks him to pretend to be her boyfriend so that she can avoid a particularly determined guy at the bar who won't stop hitting on her. The two of them hit it off, but he quickly figures out that she's running a scam on him and soon turns the tables on her and her partner. Undaunted, Jess begs Nicky to teach her what he knows about the criminal life, and he brings her in on a plan to steal from as many people as possible during Super Bowl week in New Orleans. She turns out to be a natural, and quickly learns the ropes of this unscrupulous world. Nicky and Jess seem to be falling for each other, but Nicky's actions at the end of their New Orleans trip force Jess to reassess their relationship. Three years later, Nicky enters into a deal with Garriga (Rodrigo Santoro), a wealthy playboy who has a software program that will help his Formula 1 team triumph. Nicky agrees to help Garriga sell a fake version of the program to his competitors, but as the plan goes into motion he discovers Jess and Garriga are a couple. As old feelings complicate the new arrangement, Nicky must also contend with the no-nonsense Owens (Gerald McRaney), Garriga's head-of-security who openly distrusts Nicky(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Who Wants to Be a Millionaire</title>
    <desc lang="en">Although the once-hot game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? had lost its luster as a prime-time ABC offering, the producers felt that there was enough life left in the property to warrant a Monday-through-Friday syndicated version. Taking over from the earlier series' host Regis Philbin was Meredith Vieira of The View. To make certain that the series would not be bankrupted after its first week on the air, the questions posed to contestants were considerably harder than those on the prime-time incarnation. Also, the famous "fastest finger" round was eliminated, taking some of the pressure off the contestants when they struggled to come up with answers. The most noteworthy change from the original version was the absence of Regis Philbin's familiar catchphrases: One would never hear Meredith Vieira chime in with the legendary "Is that your final answer?" The syndicated Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? was launched on September 16, 2002(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Although the once-hot game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? had lost its luster as a prime-time ABC offering, the producers felt that there was enough life left in the property to warrant a Monday-through-Friday syndicated version. Taking over from the earlier series' host Regis Philbin was Meredith Vieira of The View. To make certain that the series would not be bankrupted after its first week on the air, the questions posed to contestants were considerably harder than those on the prime-time incarnation. Also, the famous "fastest finger" round was eliminated, taking some of the pressure off the contestants when they struggled to come up with answers. The most noteworthy change from the original version was the absence of Regis Philbin's familiar catchphrases: One would never hear Meredith Vieira chime in with the legendary "Is that your final answer?" The syndicated Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? was launched on September 16, 2002(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">House on Haunted Hill</title>
    <desc lang="en">In this remake of William Castle's campy 1958 classic, an eccentric millionaire named Steven Price invites a diverse group of people to a reputedly haunted mansion that was formerly the site of an insane asylum. Steven offers his guests $1,000,000 each if they can spend the entire night at the old house without fleeing in terror. It sounds simple enough, but when those stories about ghosts haunting the mansion turn out to be true, the guests may no longer opt to stick around. In this version, Steven is played by Geoffrey Rush, and his guests include Jeffrey Combs, Taye Diggs, Peter Gallagher, Chris Kattan, and Bridgette Wilson; Famke Janssen plays Evelyn Price. Sadly, this remake does not feature the original's memorable special-effects gimmick, "Emergo," an inflatable plastic skeleton that rolled on wires through the theater during showings(n)</desc>

Jackson is Elmo McElroy, a kilt-wearing, golf club-wielding Los Angeles native who has invented an illegal drug formula that he hopes will provide him with a last major score of 20 million dollars before he retires from a life of crime. He travels to Liverpool, England, where he hopes to find a buyer for his creation among the denizens of the city's rave scene, but his plans go awry when those who are in on the deal start turning up dead. Elmo's only protector is a chain-smoking, Yank-hating local hood named Felix De Souza (Robert Carlyle), who reluctantly partners with the violence-prone American to finish the deal and cash in, sparking a gang war between Elmo's vengeful one-time employer, The Lizard (Meat Loaf); Felix's boss, Durant (Ricky Tomlinson); crooked cop Virgil Kane (Sean Pertwee); a beautiful assassin, who also happens to be Felix's ex-girlfriend (Emily Mortimer); and an offbeat, yoga-practicing nightclub owner and mobster named Iki (Rhys Ifans).

    <title lang="en">Match of the Day 2</title>
    <desc lang="en">Mark Chapman introduces highlights of Liverpool v Manchester United at Anfield, the first time the fierce north-west rivals had met on a Monday evening since the 2004/05 season. Both teams had made solid starts to the Premier League season, with Jurgen Klopp's Reds playing the more attractive football. However, Jose Mourinho had a good record against Liverpool while manager of Chelsea, and will have been keen to come away with a victory that would put the clubs level on points. Plus, action from Sunday's fixtures - Middlesbrough v Watford at the Riverside Stadium and Southampton v Burnley at St Mary's Stadium.(n)</desc>

Peretti finds that local councils across the UK are signing contracts with management consultancy firms who can take a percentage of any savings they find. He also reveals that hundreds of the millions of taxpayers' pounds spent on these contracts are covered by confidential deals, meaning very little detail is known about them. In this revealing insight, Peretti asks if the public deserves to know more about how those charged with managing the nation's billions are spending it.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">As Rose's mum has dementia and has no way of looking after her, she tries to pass her off as work experience and attempts to get her assessed by the Elderly Care team. Although Denise and Nitin have suspicions, their attention is diverted when allegations surface of sexual abuse by a famous actor at a local children's home. Ex-copper Nitin is ready to pull him in straight away, but Al and Rose aren't so sure. The fact Rose's mum disappears only adds to the team's problems.

A valuable car parked at their target's home seems to cover the debt, but the debtor's daughter engages the pair in a bizarre stand-off in order to save her father's precious vehicle.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Bernie Fineman and Mario Pacione return to seek out more classics in need of restoration, beginning with a Porsche 928 that has suffered from years of water damage. The car's bubbled paintwork, seized brakes and rusting nuts, bolts and screws seem bad enough, but it gets worse when the vehicle's complicated electrics go haywire and trap Mario inside. Once Bernie and his team of mechanics have serviced the engine, the car is taken to a rolling road to put it through its paces, before former racing driver Paul O'Neill assesses its value to see if all the work has been worthwhile.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A Desert Storm veteran with a 1970 Dodge Hemi Challenger and a need for speed incurs the wrath of authorities when he makes a cross-country dash to be by the side of his ailing, pregnant wife in this remake of director Richard Sarafian's 1971 cult classic. Jimmy Kowolski (Viggo Mortensen) is a troubled man and devoted husband, and when his pregnant wife is suddenly hospitalized with labor problems the ex-race car driver punches the gas without hesitation. With vengeful state trooper Sgt. Preston (Steve Railsback) and the entire FBI riding his back bumper, Jimmy's only ally is fearless radio DJ The Voice (Jason Priestley) whose outspoken support finds the desperate driver becoming a national folk hero. As Jimmy races ever-faster toward an impenetrable police roadblock with the single-minded goal of being there for his wife in her moment of need, the law closes in for one final showdown on the open highway(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">As part of the ongoing ratings war between rival cable services CNN and The Fox News Network, CNN commentator Greta Van Susteren was wooed to the "other network" with promises of a much larger salary and a nightly interview program of her own. That program, On the Record With Greta Van Susteren, debuted on February 4, 2002. While some observers were mildly surprised that Van Susteren, whose politics tended to be left of center, would agree to star on a cable network with a perceived Conservative slant, most of the press attention concerning the new series was focused on Van Susteren's remarkable cosmetic-surgery makeover, which she insisted had been decided upon long before Fox News Network offered her a job. On the Record With Greta Van Susteren was seen on a Monday through Friday basis from 10:00 to 11:00 p.m. EST(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">On the Record With Brit Hume</title>
    <desc lang="en">As part of the ongoing ratings war between rival cable services CNN and The Fox News Network, CNN commentator Greta Van Susteren was wooed to the "other network" with promises of a much larger salary and a nightly interview program of her own. That program, On the Record With Greta Van Susteren, debuted on February 4, 2002. While some observers were mildly surprised that Van Susteren, whose politics tended to be left of center, would agree to star on a cable network with a perceived Conservative slant, most of the press attention concerning the new series was focused on Van Susteren's remarkable cosmetic-surgery makeover, which she insisted had been decided upon long before Fox News Network offered her a job. On the Record With Greta Van Susteren was seen on a Monday through Friday basis from 10:00 to 11:00 p.m. EST(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Noah</title>
    <desc lang="en">Darren Aronofsky brings the story of Noah's Ark to the big screen with this Paramount/New Regency production. "In the beginning, there was nothing." So starts this version of the story centered on Noah (Russell Crowe), the man entrusted by God to save the innocent animals of Earth as the rising floodwaters cleansed the planet of mankind's evil. As the telling continues, we learn how Adam and Eve's sins have passed down through generations through their sons Cain and Abel, and how the descendants of their righteous sibling Seth were entrusted with defending creation. One day, while foraging in the country, a descendant of Seth, Noah, sees his father slain by a descendant of Cain. In the process, Noah's birthright is stolen from him. Decades later, as a father of three, Noah experiences a vision foretelling the great flood that will wash over the Earth, destroying every living thing that stands on the soil. That vision leads Noah to seek out his grandfather, Methuselah, in order to understand his mission. When a second vision reveals that Noah is to construct a massive ark designed to shelter every living animal during the great flood, Noah, his wife Naameh (Jennifer Connelly), their three sons Shem (Douglas Booth), Ham (Logan Lerman), and Japheth (Leo McHugh Carroll), and their adoptive sister Ila (Emma Watson) immediately begin construction on the vessel with the help of the Watchers, a race of angels created as beings of light, but encrusted in stone and mud and forsaken by God for their attempts to help man. Meanwhile, word of Noah's work soon reaches Tubal Cain (Ray Winstone), who gathers an army on a mission to overtake the ark, and survive the coming storm by any cost(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Liam Neeson reunites with Unknown director Jaume Collet-Serra) for this airborne thriller about an Air Marshal racing to stop the villain who has framed him as a hijacker during a non-stop flight from New York to London. From the moment we first meet Air Marshal Bill Marks (Neeson), it's apparent his nerves are frayed. After furtively knocking back a stiff drink in the airport parking lot, he enters the crowded terminal to board a plane bound for London. Carefully observing his fellow travelers along the way, Marks eventually ends up seated next to nervous flyer Jen (Julianne Moore), who begins to breathe easier once she's seated near a window. Later, as the plane hits cruising altitude, Marks receives a mysterious text message stating that a passenger on the flight will be killed every 20 minutes unless $150 million is deposited into a secure bank account. But the harder Marks works to identify a suspect, the deeper he implicates himself in what becomes a deadly hostage crisis unfolding at 30,000 feet over the Atlantic Ocean. When it's revealed that the account for the ransom money is in Marks' name, the FAA revokes his marshal status and the media paints him as a hijacker. As the frightened passengers begin to turn on Marks, he suspects the true culprit may not even be on the plane. And with the help of Jen and perceptive airline hostess Nancy (Michelle Dockery), he attempts to clear his name and protect the passengers by any means possible(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Bart the Genius. Academics have never been a priority for Bart Simpson (voice of Nancy Cartwright), and when Mrs. Krabappel (voice of Marcia Wallace) hands out a standardized IQ test that will "merely determine your future social stature and financial success," Bart hedges his bets by swiping a test from class brain Martin Prince (voice of Russi Taylor) and putting his name on it. Bart is as surprised as anyone when "his" test results confirm he has a genius IQ (while Martin is revealed to not be especially bright), and suddenly the school's staff decides Bart's rebellious behavior and previous poor grades were merely a product of boredom and dissatisfaction. Bart is transferred from Springfield Elementary to the Enriched Learning Center for Gifted Children, and he discovers his father Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) has a new respect and admiration for him. But Bart finds life among the super-intelligent is rough sledding, and his brighter sister Lisa (voice of Yeardley Smith) has a hard time believing her brother is a genius. "Bart the Genius" was first aired on January 14, 1990(n)</desc>

So when Springfield's oldest lemon tree is claimed by a gang of scrappy kids from nearby Shelbyville, Bart and a group of his friends -- Milhouse (voice of Pamela Hayden), Nelson (voice of Nancy Cartwright), Martin (voice of Russi Taylor), and Todd Flanders (also voiced by Cartwright) -- slip into Shelbyville to reclaim it. When the parents learn their children have invaded Shelbyville, Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) commandeers an RV owned by Ned Flanders (voice of Harry Shearer), and they set out to rescue both the kids and the lemon tree.

Victoria and Lilly were just little girls when their father murdered their mother. In the aftermath of that tragedy, both girls disappeared without a trace. Desperate, their Uncle Lucas (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) and his girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain) searched everywhere for the missing girls. Five years later, Victoria and Lilly are both found living in a derelict cabin deep in the woods. Incredibly, they've managed to survive on their own, though years of isolation have left them both in a feral state, and unable to communicate. Without hesitation, Lucas and Annabel welcome the two frightened girls into their home, and work hard to make them feel comfortable. But when a series of ominous events lead Lucas and Annabel to suspect that Victoria and Lilly share ties to an evil beyond human comprehension, the couple must discern whether the two young girls are merely dealing with the emotional aftershocks of a life-altering tragedy, or have attracted a force that could destroy their family all over again(n)</desc>

However, there's no time to marvel at how far they've come - it's Patisserie Week, and they will need to demonstrate that they have skills worthy enough to see them through to this year's final.

    <desc lang="en">Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc present as the remaining four bakers take a deep breath and head into the semi-final of the nation's favourite baking contest. However, there's no time to marvel at how far they've come - it's Patisserie Week, and they will need to demonstrate that they have skills worthy enough to see them through to this year's final. The bakers are challenged to make a signature baklava - two types of any flavour they like, before the technical challenge demands they knock up a German Schichttorte, a cake cooked in stages under the grill to create 20 layers of different coloured sponge. Finally, the showstopper sees the semi-finalists baking non-stop to create two entremets in which they should demonstrate as many personal skills and techniques as they can.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Over the past 10 weeks, we have seen the amateur bakers whip up eclairs sprinkled with bacon, fire-breathing biscuit dragons and a very controversial baked Alaska. But now, just three contestants remain - and only one more weekend of baking stands between them and the trophy. Judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry have saved their most fiendish tests till last, as the finalists face a Signature Challenge in which they have just three hours to prove they have mastered a pastry technique that usually takes a whole day. They then have to tackle a Technical Challenge without the aid of a recipe, before rustling up a Showstopper that turns sponge, caramel, choux pastry and petits fours into a winning combination. At least Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc are on hand to lighten the atmosphere if it all gets too tense.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Coraline</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Henry Selick (The Nightmare Before Christmas; James and the Giant Peach) delivers a deliciously dark stop-motion animated adventure for children who don't mind a scare or two, based on Neil Gaiman's much-praised book. Coraline Jones and her parents have just moved into the Pink Palaces Apartments in Oregon, where they find themselves surrounded by eccentric neighbours, including a pair of ageing burlesque performers. It should be an exciting time, but Coraline's parents are too busy as horticultural journalists to spend any time with her, so she is deeply bored. That is until she discovers a mysterious door that only appears after dark. Bold and inquisitive, the youngster investigates. She discovers a brightly coloured alternative universe, where her 'Other Mother' has plenty of time to play with her and her neighbours' quirks are charmingly exaggerated; in fact, she's tempted to stay. But all is not as it seems: everyone in the new world has buttons for eyes - and the operation to install them involves knitting needles. And that revelation is just the first of her shocking discoveries about the true nature of her apparent idyll... So, there's definitely good reason for that PG certificate, though children who can cope with the story of Hansel and Gretel shouldn't find anything too disturbing here. Selick's film won great critical acclaim, and scooped festival prizes around the world, as well as picking up an Oscar nomination and winning the 2009 BAFTA Children's Award(n)</desc>

When he can't get his own father Dabney Coleman to believe him, Thomas turns disconsolately to a computer game called "Cloak and Dagger" and begins to fantasize, imagining that he is in cahoots with secret agent Jack Flack, also played by Coleman. Finally coming to grips with the fact that the mythical Jack Flack cannot help him this time, Thomas takes on the spies with the help of his schoolmates, who are also "Cloak and Dagger" addicts. Cloak and Dagger is a heavily disguised remake of 1949's The Window; both are based on the Cornell Woolrich story The Boy Cried Murder(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Writer and director Robert Rodriguez returns to the family-friendly adventure of his Spy Kids movies with this three-dimensional action opus. Max (Cayden Boyd) is a ten-year-old boy who doesn't get along with his peers and is constantly bullied at school. But Max has an active imagination, and he has a pair of very special imaginary playmates -- Shark Boy (Taylor Lautner), a human-shark half-breed cared for by a pack of great whites, and Lava Girl (Taylor Dooley), a girl with superpowers who can conjure heat and fire at will. Max may be a creative boy, but what he doesn't know is that Shark Boy and Lava Girl really do exist, and he is recruited to help them as they do battle against Mr. Electricity, a super-villain determined to deprive children of their sleep. Shot and originally released in the 3-D format, The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl also stars David Arquette and Kristin Davis as Max's parents, and George Lopez as a schoolteacher; writer and director Rodriguez wrote the film's story in collaboration with his then seven-year-old son, Racer Rodriguez(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A murder lifts the lid on some disturbing actions among the pupils at a well-respected school in this drama. Nigel (Tom Sturridge), a student at an exclusive British private school, has been found murdered, and police detective McKenzie (Richard Roxburgh) has been assigned to investigate. Alex Forbes (Eddie Redmayne), one of Nigel's classmates who was known to have little fondness for him, is a prime suspect and has been brought in for questioning; however, he refuses to cooperate, and Sally Rowe (Toni Collette), a forensic psychiatrist working with the police, is brought in to talk to the boy. While Alex is initially no more helpful with Sally, in time she's able to find cracks in his resistance, and he begins to discuss his interest in the Knights Templar, a medieval Christian military order. As Alex shares his belief that the benefits of some actions can outweigh their wrongs, Sally learns more about the boy, and her research turns up some surprising facts – Nigel believed both he and Alex were descended from members of the Knights Templar, they may have been responsible for the death of a schoolmate in the interest of gaining mystical powers, and Alex's father (Patrick Malahide), also the headmaster at the school, has some troubling secrets of his own.

    <title lang="en">Capote</title>
    <desc lang="en">The creation of one of the most memorable books of the 1960s -- and the impact the writing and research would have on its author -- is explored in this drama based on a true story. In 1959, Truman Capote (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman) was a critically acclaimed novelist who had earned a small degree of celebrity for his work when he read a short newspaper item about a multiple murder in a small Kansas town. For some reason, the story fascinated Capote, and he asked William Shawn (Bob Balaban), his editor at The New Yorker, to let him write a piece about the case. Capote had long believed that in the right hands, a true story could be molded into a tale as compelling as any fiction, and he believed this event, in which the brutal and unimaginable was visited upon a community where it was least expected, could be just the right material. Capote traveled to Kansas with his close friend Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), herself becoming a major literary figure with the success of To Kill a Mockingbird, and while Capote's effete and mannered personal style stuck out like a sore thumb in Kansas, in time he gained the trust of Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper), the Kansas Bureau of Investigation agent investigating the murder of the Clutter family, and with his help Capote's magazine piece grew into a full-length book. Capote also became familiar with the petty criminals who killed the Clutter family, Dick Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) and Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.), and in Smith he found a troubling kindred spirit more like himself than he wanted to admit. After attaining a sort of friendship with Smith under the assumption that the man would be executed before the book was ever published, Capote finds himself forced to directly confront the moral implications of his actions with regards to both his role in the man's death, and the way that he would be remembered. Capote also co-stars Bruce Greenwood as Capote's longtime companion Jack Dunphy, and Amy Ryan as Mary Dewey, Alvin's wife who became a confidante of Capote's(n)</desc>

Morton, and, in her first of many appearances with the Stooges, Symona Boniface. A former playwright turned dress extra, the dignified Miss Boniface signed a contract with Columbia in 1935 and would be on the receiving end of many an airborne pie for years to come(n)</desc>

The victim's background, together with the suggestion she may have been raped, means the incident is soon the subject of much media speculation, and strong evidence implicates a theatre director who ran a drama workshop the girl attended on the night she died. The detective believes he has found his man, but Morton fears her colleague isn't seeing the bigger picture.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Tony Robinson embarks on another expedition through some of Britain's most historic landscapes. The moors and valleys of West Yorkshire were the home of, and inspiration for, the Brontes, the literary family who produced such classics as Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre. Over four days, Tony heads out from the Victorian wool capital of Bradford and treks in a giant loop around what is now known as Bronte Country. From the birth of Charlotte, Emily, Anne and their brother Branwell in the suburb of Thornton, he traces their childhoods to the much-romanticised Bronte hub of Haworth, finding that the harsh reality of life in the 1820s was far removed from the fantasy world dreamed up by the children at their father's parsonage home.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Unable to get used to the fact she was second choice for the sergeant's job, Rachel punishes Janet for keeping the truth from her, and although Will cheers her up with the news she has been chosen for a vice initiative, the detective is soon stung by Gill's harsh words. Meanwhile, an unconscious baby is admitted to hospital with injuries that do not match his parents' explanation of events, and when an unregistered childminder and her boyfriend enter the equation, it's unclear who had the boy's best interests at heart.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">End Game - End Spiel.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Peter Barton concludes his examination of the events of the First World War battle from German and British perspectives by looking at the final months of the campaign, showing how a remarkable German tactical revolution that began in the summer continued to frustrate the Allied advance and extended the entire war far beyond expectations. The historian also argues that the Battle of the Somme ended not in the winter of 1916, but in the spring of 1917, and reaches the conclusion that there was no British victory. Last in the series.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Hills Have Eyes</title>
    <desc lang="en">Horror auteur Wes Craven followed his threadbare but horrifically compelling cult classic Last House on the Left with this wonderfully demented morality fable about a bloody war of attrition between two extremely different families. The story opens on the journey of the Carters, a mildly dysfunctional extended family led by patriarch "Big Bob" Carter (Russ Grieve), as they travel across the California desert in search of an inherited silver mine. When a broken axle leaves them stranded in the middle of a former nuclear testing site, their attempts to find help lead them unwittingly into the territory of a savage family of cave-dwelling cannibals, the apparent progeny of the bearlike Jupiter (James Whitworth) and an abducted prostitute. Jupiter's eldest son Pluto (professional movie weirdo Michael Berryman) leads the first brutal attack on the defenseless Carters who, through necessity, are driven to equally extreme measures in order to survive. Though the film is not overtly bloody, the scenes depicting this confrontation are rendered with an unflinching directness, and the violations visited on the Carters are so brutal as to make the survivors' regression into savagery all the more convincing. No one is spared from the nightmare: Jupiter's boys have even kidnapped the youngest member of the Carter family -- a mere infant -- to serve as fodder for their next barbecue, and the baby becomes the main point of contention between the rival clans. Craven nevertheless refuses to take the easy way out by depicting his "monsters" as soullessly evil; parallels between either family's "values" are clearly drawn as the differences between the two clans begin to blur(n)</desc>

Determined to salvage their troubled relationship, Jenn's boyfriend Alex (Jeff Roop) takes them to a secluded campsite near a scenic lake where he used to play as a child.

His wife Lois (Mare Winningham) provides most of the family income. Stephen gets a job in a mine and saves a friend who has been injured, helping him erase his guilt over abandoning another friend during a firefight in Vietnam. Meanwhile, the Simmons children, Stu (Elijah Wood) and Lidia (Lexi Randall) are feuding with an even poorer family of neighbors, the Lipnickis, over access to a tree fort that Stu and Lidia built. Mr. Lipnicki (Raynor Scheine) is drunken and abusive and helps escalate the disagreement into a major battle for the fort(n)</desc>

Gavilan moonlights as a real estate agent, while Calden teaches yoga and yearns for a career on the big screen. When an entire hip-hop group is murdered on-stage, Gavilan and Calden are called in to handle the case. As their investigation progresses, they begin to suspect that the rappers were offed for attempting to get out of their recording contract with label head Sartain (Isaiah Washington). Along with Bruce Greenwood and Keith David, the supporting cast boasts a plethora of real-life musicians, including Dr. Dre, Gladys Knight, Dwight Yoakam, Master P, and Ronald DeVoe of New Edition and Bell Biv DeVoe(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Usual Suspects</title>
    <desc lang="en">Near the end of The Usual Suspects, Kevin Spacey, in his Oscar-winning performance as crippled con man Roger "Verbal" Kint, says, "The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist." This may be the key line in this story; the farther along the movie goes, the more one realizes that not everything is quite what it seems, and what began as a conventional whodunit turns into something quite different. A massive explosion rips through a ship in a San Pedro, CA, harbor, leaving 27 men dead, the lone survivor horribly burned, and 91 million dollars' worth of cocaine, believed to be on board, mysteriously missing. Police detective Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) soon brings in the only witness and key suspect, "Verbal" Kint. Kint's nickname stems from his inability to keep his mouth shut, and he recounts the events that led to the disaster. Five days earlier, a truckload of gun parts was hijacked in Queens, NY, and five men were brought in as suspects: Kint, hot-headed hipster thief McManus (Stephen Baldwin), ill-tempered thug Hockney (Kevin Pollak), flashy wise guy Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), and Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), a cop gone bad now trying to go straight in the restaurant business. While in stir, someone suggests that they should pull a job together, and Kint hatches a plan for a simple and lucrative jewel heist. Despite Keaton's misgivings, the five men pull off the robbery without a hitch and fly to Los Angeles to fence the loot. Their customer asks if they'd be interested in pulling a quick job while out West; the men agree, but the robbery goes horribly wrong and they soon find themselves visited by Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite), who represents a criminal mastermind named Keyser Soze. Soze's violent reputation is so infamous that he's said to have responded to a threat to murder his family by killing them himself, just to prove that he feared no one. When Kobayashi passes along a heist proposed by Soze that sounds like suicide, the men feel that they have little choice but to agree(n)</desc>

As Timmy's health rapidly begins to take a turn for the worse, his concerned mother, Rachel (Rhona Mitra), does her best to care for the ailing young boy. Though his mother may not have a clue as to what fate is about to befall her frightened child, a group of specially appointed guardians who have been watching over Timmy since birth know the truth about the events that are beginning to unfold. Timmy is a half-blood, and when the red moon is full, the creature who once appeared to be a normal boy will finally gain the power to take control of his family's destiny. But until that fateful night, Timmy's life will be in constant danger by the renegade faction of lycanthropes who are willing to kill in order to maintain their vicious way of life. It won't be long until the red moon rises, but until that prophesied moment, the forces of light and the forces of darkness will clash in the ultimate battle for true supremacy. Jason X director James Isaac takes the helm for a frightening tale of fate and fantasy co-starring Elias Koteas, Jason Behr, and Kim Coates(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Usual Suspects</title>
    <desc lang="en">Near the end of The Usual Suspects, Kevin Spacey, in his Oscar-winning performance as crippled con man Roger "Verbal" Kint, says, "The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist." This may be the key line in this story; the farther along the movie goes, the more one realizes that not everything is quite what it seems, and what began as a conventional whodunit turns into something quite different. A massive explosion rips through a ship in a San Pedro, CA, harbor, leaving 27 men dead, the lone survivor horribly burned, and 91 million dollars' worth of cocaine, believed to be on board, mysteriously missing. Police detective Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) soon brings in the only witness and key suspect, "Verbal" Kint. Kint's nickname stems from his inability to keep his mouth shut, and he recounts the events that led to the disaster. Five days earlier, a truckload of gun parts was hijacked in Queens, NY, and five men were brought in as suspects: Kint, hot-headed hipster thief McManus (Stephen Baldwin), ill-tempered thug Hockney (Kevin Pollak), flashy wise guy Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), and Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), a cop gone bad now trying to go straight in the restaurant business. While in stir, someone suggests that they should pull a job together, and Kint hatches a plan for a simple and lucrative jewel heist. Despite Keaton's misgivings, the five men pull off the robbery without a hitch and fly to Los Angeles to fence the loot. Their customer asks if they'd be interested in pulling a quick job while out West; the men agree, but the robbery goes horribly wrong and they soon find themselves visited by Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite), who represents a criminal mastermind named Keyser Soze. Soze's violent reputation is so infamous that he's said to have responded to a threat to murder his family by killing them himself, just to prove that he feared no one. When Kobayashi passes along a heist proposed by Soze that sounds like suicide, the men feel that they have little choice but to agree(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Medieval fantasy meets futuristic science fiction in this effects-heavy action epic from former X-Files director Rob Bowman. In present-day London, 12-year-old Quinn Abercromby witnesses the awakening of a hibernating dragon from a centuries-long slumber, the result of a construction dig supervised by his mother and an incident for which Quinn feels partially responsible. Twenty years later, the adult Quinn is the fire chief of a refortified castle community, responsible for dousing the blazes lit by the dragon's prodigious number of flame-spewing offspring, airborne juggernauts that have wreaked havoc across the globe, torching civilization and turning humans into an endangered species. Hope arrives in the form of Denton "Dragon Slayer" Van Zan, an American known to be the only man to ever kill one of the dragons, and Alex Jenson, a scientist/pilot who's a member of Van Zan's army, a zealous fighting force that includes a secret weapon: the Archangels, paratroopers using themselves as bait to attract and then dispatch the deadly beasts(n)</desc>

Able to do what most law enforcement officers only dream of, Carlin is now able to look back in time at the perpetrator's movements, and at the life of the innocent woman whose death would set the events into motion. Carlin's instincts tell him that something is amiss, however, and while the government agent who tapped him for the job (Val Kilmer) and the team of ultra-cool scientists who run the project (Adam Goldberg, Erika Alexander) tell him one story about the quantum physics behind this marvel of technology, the hotshot agent suspects that there is a greater power at their fingertips -- one that might not just solve the crime at hand, but prevent it(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Medieval fantasy meets futuristic science fiction in this effects-heavy action epic from former X-Files director Rob Bowman. In present-day London, 12-year-old Quinn Abercromby witnesses the awakening of a hibernating dragon from a centuries-long slumber, the result of a construction dig supervised by his mother and an incident for which Quinn feels partially responsible. Twenty years later, the adult Quinn is the fire chief of a refortified castle community, responsible for dousing the blazes lit by the dragon's prodigious number of flame-spewing offspring, airborne juggernauts that have wreaked havoc across the globe, torching civilization and turning humans into an endangered species. Hope arrives in the form of Denton "Dragon Slayer" Van Zan, an American known to be the only man to ever kill one of the dragons, and Alex Jenson, a scientist/pilot who's a member of Van Zan's army, a zealous fighting force that includes a secret weapon: the Archangels, paratroopers using themselves as bait to attract and then dispatch the deadly beasts(n)</desc>

Carlin's instincts tell him that something is amiss, however, and while the government agent who tapped him for the job (Val Kilmer) and the team of ultra-cool scientists who run the project (Adam Goldberg, Erika Alexander) tell him one story about the quantum physics behind this marvel of technology, the hotshot agent suspects that there is a greater power at their fingertips -- one that might not just solve the crime at hand, but prevent it(n)</desc>

As Jung struggles to help his patient overcome some pressing paternal issues, disturbed patient Otto Gross (Vincent Cassel) sets out to test the boundaries of the doctor's professional resolve. A Dangerous Method screened at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">To Sir, With Love</title>
    <desc lang="en">Sidney Poitier, who in 1955 played a student in a tough inner-city high school, portrays a teacher assigned to a similar institution in To Sir, With Love. Unable to find work as an engineer, Poitier accepts a teaching post in London's East End slums. To reach his sullen, rebellious students, Poitier throws away his textbooks and endeavors to reach them as human beings--and as the adults they're going to become. It's an uphill climb, but gradually the students are won over. They begin referring to Poitier as "Sir," not out of blind obedience but as a gesture of genuine affection. Not that there aren't obstacles to overcome: in addition to trying to get through to hardcase student Christian Roberts, Poitier must face down the resistance and hostility of his fellow teachers. The sweetly sentimental finale amply displays the vocal talents of Lulu, who trills the title song. Based on the novel by E. R. Brainwaite, To Sir, With Love was one of the biggest moneyspinners of 1967 (with this film, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner and In the Heat of the Night, Sidney Poitier had quite a year).

    <desc lang="en">From the producers of The Rookie and Remember the Titans comes an inspirational sports drama detailing the true story of a down-on-his-luck football fan whose dreams of standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the best of the gridiron became a once-in-a-lifetime reality when he took part in an open tryout organized by Philadelphia Eagles coach Dick Vermeil. Vince Papale (Mark Wahlberg) was a 30-year-old substitute teacher and part-time bartender who had never even played college football. When Coach Vermeil (Greg Kinnear) made the unprecedented announcement that he would be holding open tryouts for the Philadelphia Eagles, Papale would go against incredible odds to live the dream and experience every fan's biggest fantasy. With a position on the Eagles secured and a new life path forged out of little more than determination and persistence, Papale takes to the field to experience the life-altering rush of running yards as a stadium full of cheering fans burst from their seats to support the hometown hero who proved it's never too late to take control of your own destiny(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Wrong Turn</title>
    <desc lang="en">A turn down an uncharted dirt road leads six young people into a night of pure terror in this horror story. Chris (Desmond Harrington) is driving through West Virginia on his way to a job interview when an auto accident slows highway traffic to a near standstill. Afraid he'll be late, Chris takes a detour down an old dirt road; a distracted Chris doesn't see an SUV stuck in the middle of the road before it's too late, and he plows into the back after his tires suddenly blow. The driver of the SUV, Jessie (Eliza Dushku), was out on a camping trip with four of her friends -- Evan (Kevin Zegers), Francine (Lindy Booth), Carly (Emmanuelle Chriqui), and Scott (Jeremy Sisto) -- when their tires went out, and as Jessie and Chris compare notes on their accidents, they discover that the road has been sabotaged with barbed wire. With both parties in need of a telephone, Evan and Francine are left to look after the cars while the other four set out to find help. However, Evan and Francine soon discover they've been led into a horrible trap, and as Chris, Jessie, and their friends search for help, they find that they've fallen victim not to local pranksters, but a gang of inbred backwoods killers with a taste for blood. Wrong Turn was produced in part by Stan Winston, a legendary special-effects artist whose work has appeared in such films as Jurassic Park, Aliens, and Terminator 2: Judgment Day(n)</desc>
