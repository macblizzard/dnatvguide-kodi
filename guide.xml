    <sub-title lang="en">Punchy Cowpunchers</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Punchy Cowpunchers. Everybody is a comic in this Three Stooges picture. The killer Dillon clan are shooting up a Western town and Nell (Christine McIntyre) sends her handsome, but clumsy oaf of a sweetheart, Elmer, off to get help. Help comes in the form of the Stooges, who are playing a trio of cavalrymen so incompetent that their frustrated sergeant sends them on the mission only because he believes they won't return alive. The boys dress up as desperadoes and enter the town's saloon, doing their best to appear tough. While ordering drinks, Shemp asks for a milkshake "made with sour milk!" Their lack of prowess in all things Western is immediately apparent, and on top of that, the gang's leader (Kenneth MacDonald) figures out they are spies. The Stooges attempt a different kind of disguise. This time they're waiters, but their fake mustaches give them away in almost record time. Eventually they do emerge victorious over the bad guys, but it's only with Nell's help (she's upstairs, cold-cocking every bad guy who has the misfortune to enter her room), and Shemp's winning battle with two of the bad men and a stick of dynamite. Elmer shows up eventually and when he tells Nell that cowboys don't settle down, she beans him with a piece of crockery. This knocks some sense into him, ending the picture on something of a romantic note(n)</desc>

Moving through the mob milieu, Hill comes into contact with veteran Irish hood Robert De Niro, who takes the youngster under his wing to teach him the unwritten rules of the underworld and impress upon him the value of loyalty to the members of his surrogate 'family'(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In this supernatural thriller, Tom Witzky (Kevin Bacon) is a fairly typical working-class guy living in Chicago with his wife Maggie (Kathryn Erbe) and his son Jake (Zachary David Cope). One night at a party, Tom gets into a lively discussion with his sister-in-law, Lisa (Illeana Douglas), who believes in psychic communication and the power of hypnosis. He challenges Lisa to hypnotize him, and she plants in him a post-hypnotic suggestion to be more open-minded. But the results aren't quite what Lisa or Tom expected; Tom now senses an air of terrible dread throughout his house and is convinced that evil lurks just around the corner. He also sees the spirit of a girl from the neighborhood who disappeared months ago -- and Jake sees the spirit as well. Stir of Echoes was based on a novel by Richard Matheson, whose work inspired such disparate films as Somewhere in Time and The Incredible Shrinking Man; it was written and directed by David Koepp, who wrote the screenplays for Jurassic Park and Mission: Impossible(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Warwick Davis starts his research with his paternal grandmother Edith, who led to his big break at the age of 11 when she heard a radio advert. That advert was 'looking for short people to appear in Return of the Jedi', and Warwick was catapulted to stardom, continuing his acting career in the likes of Labyrinth and Willow. He takes a non-judgemental approach as he researches the family line stretching back from Edith, finding humanity and humour in some uncomfortable stories, while on his maternal side, he finds out about a postman who lived a double life.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Another mystery for the cops on the Caribbean island of Saint Marie, where the sun shines all day and it seems half the residents are killers-in-waiting. However, it's all change for the team. Last week they waved goodbye to Humphrey Goodman. No one knows how Kris Marshall's character is bowing out of the show - will he walk off into the sunset with new love Martha, or will he meet a sticky end, like his predecessor Richard Poole (Ben Miller)? What we do know is that in his place is Ardal O'Hanlon as DI Jack Mooney, who first popped up in the two-part London special. His first Caribbean case sees the reopening of a seven-year-old murder when a tourist provides an alibi for the woman convicted of the crime.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The home potters are tested on the art of Japanese-style ceramics. For the main challenge, they throw a sake set, consisting of one bottle and six identical cups. The exciting part, however, comes during the firing, when they use a risky 16th-century method in which they pull their burning pieces out of the kiln and plunge them into a bin full of combustible materials. For the spot test, they must pierce and carve an intricate design into a lantern using a technique known as the `devil's work', and the throw down sees them back at the wheel, making as many rice bowls as they can in 15 minutes.(n)</desc>

It was some of the worst football violence seen at an international tournament and raised serious concerns ahead of millions of fans travelling to Russia for the 2018 World Cup. To find out what UK supporters could face, film-maker Alex Stockley von Statzer travels to Russia to investigate this new generation of `firms' who are teetotal, physically fit and trained in martial arts. He also finds out how Russian police are enacting new laws promising to get tough on any trouble-makers, and films an organised fight in the woods where one firm is `auditioning' new members.(n)</desc>

His work was considered to be ahead of its time - so much so that it was all but ignored for 300 years. El Greco developed a highly individualistic style that eventually proved enormously influential, paving the way for the Baroque and providing the inspiration for 20th-century expressionism.(n)</desc>

With a steel plate subsequently attached to his skull and ten razor-sharp fingernails ready to scrape grey matter from the skulls of his victims, Jacob retreated to the abandoned Blackwell Hotel, where he resided in the darkened, rotting hallways while planning his ultimate revenge. As fate would have it, Jacob wouldn't have to go far to satiate his raging bloodlust, though, and as the unsuspecting teens make their way through the crumbling corridors of the once-luxurious inn guided by the very same policeman who fired that misguided bullet years earlier, the notorious killer sharpens his nails, stalks his prey, and prepares for a little payback(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">An authority on rare books is drawn into a confrontation with the forces of darkness in this thriller directed by Roman Polanski. Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) is a rare book broker who makes his living tracking down valuable items for rich bibliophiles. Corso is hired by Boris Balkan (Frank Langella), a millionaire New Yorker with a vast collection of occult literature and a keen interest in "The Nine Gates to the Kingdom of Shadows." Legend has it that the book was co-written by Satan in the 17th century, and only three copies are known to exist; the owner of one recently sold the book to Balkan a few days before killing himself. Balkan wants Corso to find the other two copies (one owned by a Mr. Fargas in Portugal and the other by a French collector named Kessler) and examine them to determine if they are forgeries. Corso is told to be thorough and spare no expense. He begins by visiting Liana Telfer (Lena Olin), the widow of the man who once owned Balkan's copy of the book, who has an unusually strong desire to get the book back, and confers with his friend Bernie (James Russo), who soon turns up dead, in a manner much like an illustration from the book. Corso learns that the book contains clues to a puzzle that will allow people to call up the devil, and certain people will stop at nothing to find the missing parts of the formula(n)</desc>

It was a mere four years ago that seven-foot menace Jacob Goodnight (WWE superstar Kane) was shot in the head and left for dead by a local police officer. But Jacob wasn't going down that easy. With a steel plate subsequently attached to his skull and ten razor-sharp fingernails ready to scrape grey matter from the skulls of his victims, Jacob retreated to the abandoned Blackwell Hotel, where he resided in the darkened, rotting hallways while planning his ultimate revenge. As fate would have it, Jacob wouldn't have to go far to satiate his raging bloodlust, though, and as the unsuspecting teens make their way through the crumbling corridors of the once-luxurious inn guided by the very same policeman who fired that misguided bullet years earlier, the notorious killer sharpens his nails, stalks his prey, and prepares for a little payback(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May embark on a race from London's Wembley Stadium to Milan's San Siro, the home of Italian football giants AC and Inter. A price restriction leads Jeremy to grab the keys to a Shelby Mustang GT500, which costs the equivalent of £35,000 in America and packs a supercharged punch of more than 650bhp. James and Richard pin their hopes on the pan-European rail network in a bid to secure the prize of tickets to a top-flight football match, with nothing but a long journey home awaiting the losers. On the test track, Jeremy puts Toyota's GT86 coupe through its paces, and its promise of entertaining rear-wheel-drive handling should put a smile on his face.

    <title lang="en">Animals in Love</title>
    <desc lang="en">In the second of two programmes about relationships in the wild, Liz Bonnin explores the ways in which animals get together. She observes a form of extreme flirting in a troop of capuchin monkeys in South America, which sees the females go to extraordinary lengths to attract the alpha male, reveals how African hyenas find it tough getting a girl and how an orang-utan in America chooses its partner in a very 21st-century way. For other animals, it turns out smell is a deal-breaker, while for others, it's all about having the best moves on the dance floor.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Scientists predict a fit of violent activity on the sun which will propel billions of tonnes of superheated gas and pulses of energy towards Earth. In 1989 one of these solar storms, which has the power to close down modern technology, cut off the power to the Canadian city of Quebec. Horizon meets the weathermen as they try to predict what is coming and organisations like the National Grid as they prepare for the cosmic tempest.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Moonstruck</title>
    <desc lang="en">When there's a full moon over Brooklyn, anything can happen, and everything happens in the neighborhood where widowed bookkeeper Loretta Castorini (Cher) lives. First, Loretta agrees to marry a man she does not love, Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello), simply because he knows how to propose properly. Before the wedding can take place, Cammareri must visit his dying mother in Sicily. In his absence, Loretta is supposed to try to patch up the differences between Johnny and his brother, bakery operator Ronny Cammareri (Nicolas Cage). Having never forgiven Johnny for indirectly causing the accident that crippled him, Ronny flies into a rage whenever his brother's name is mentioned. He does, however, fall for Loretta like a ton of bricks. After a torrid affair, Loretta tries to avoid Ronny out of respect to Johnny, but he's just too fascinating to resist. Meanwhile, Loretta's father (Vincent Gardenia) is fooling around with his mistress Mona (Anita Gillette), while Loretta's mother (Olympia Dukakis) is wooed by a college professor (John Mahoney). These brief flings are forgiven and forgotten, but there's still the delicate situation of Loretta being in love with her future brother-in-law. A now-classic romantic comedy, Moonstruck won Oscars for Cher, Olympia Dukakis, and screenwriter John Patrick Shanley(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Mystery Men</title>
    <desc lang="en">Can seven not-so-superheroes save a city of the future? Based on the comic book series created by Bob Burden, Mystery Men is set in the teeming metropolis of Champion City, where noble superhero Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear) keeps the peace and sees that justice is done. When Captain Amazing mysteriously disappears, his archenemy Casanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush) sees his opportunity to seize power and bend the city to his evil will, with his associate Dr. Annabel Leek (Lena Olin) at his side. However, Casanova will not succeed without a fight, as the The Mystery Men leap into action. The Mystery Men are not your ordinary Men of Steel; in fact, they're barely superheroes at all. Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller) has one gift: throwing tantrums. Blue Raja (Hank Azaria) is a deadly hand with spoons and forks (but not knives). Shoveler (William H. Macy) can dig with superior speed and force. The Bowler (Janeane Garafalo) rolls the ball with superhuman precision. Spleen (Paul Reubens) has a gaseous problem that he's turned into a weapon against evildoers. Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell) is convinced he can become invisible at will, but he hasn't actually done it yet. And The Sphinx (Wes Studi) does have an unusual power: he can cut metal objects with his mind. Aided by addled gadget master Dr. Heller (Tom Waits), the Mystery Men make their move against Casanova and Annabel, who feel just threatened enough to make things personal by kidnapping Mr. Furious' girlfriend Monica (Claire Forlani). Mystery Men marked the feature directorial debut of Kinka Usher, who previously directed such ads as the Taco Bell talking chihuahua and the Dairy Association's "Got Milk?"(n)</desc>

The relentless pressure and long hours at the Mayfair establishment seem to take their toll on Leon, but he barely has time to think before flying over to Alicante, Spain, to work in the kitchen of the world renowned Quique Dacosta.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Having shown they have what it takes to bake a cake or two, the 11 remaining contestants turn their attention to biscuits. First up they create their signature savoury crackers for cheese, and are encouraged to push the flavour. In the technical challenge, they have to prepare Mary Berry's Florentines, with their chewy caramel sauce and brandy-snap texture, before ending with a showstopper like no other - three-dimensional scenes made entirely from biscuits. For one hopeful, there will be the pride of being crowned Star Baker, while another will be sent home - well aware that that's just the way the cookie crumbles.

    <sub-title lang="en">Bread.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The 10 remaining contestants face three tasks designed to test their bread-making skills, beginning by creating 12 perfect rye bread rolls shaped in any way they like and using as much flour as they dare. For the technical challenge they have to prepare Italian ciabatta using Paul's recipe, before ending with show-stopping centrepiece loaves that will have to make an impact on the table as well as on the judges. Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry then decide which of the contenders will be the week's star baker - and which of them is going home. Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins present.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Summer Catch</title>
    <desc lang="en">This blend of sports and youthful romantic comedy is from director Michael Tollin, who previously produced the sports drama Varsity Blues (1999). Freddie Prinze Jr. stars as Ryan Dunne, a ballplayer who's spending the summer as a pitcher for the famed, highly prestigious Cape Cod League, a non-professional farm team that has turned out numerous baseball legends. Ryan's under special pressure on a number of fronts. He's the first local boy to earn a slot in the league in years, and his blue-collar status earns him the enmity of a hot-shot college teammate, Eric Van Leemer (Corey Pearson). Although he's backed up by his best friend and team catcher Billy Brubaker (Matthew Lillard), Ryan adds more stress to his life by embarking on an affair with a beautiful, wealthy young Vassar graduate, Tenley Parrish (Jessica Biel), who's spending the summer on the Cape with her parents. Tenley is facing her own crisis as her father (Bruce Davison) pressures her to move to San Francisco and work with her uncle, though she'd rather remain in the East and become an architect. Summer Catch is the third onscreen teaming of Prinze and Lillard, and also stars Brian Dennehy, Wilmer Valderrama, Jason Gedrick, Fred Ward, and Brittany Murphy(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This blend of sports and youthful romantic comedy is from director Michael Tollin, who previously produced the sports drama Varsity Blues (1999). Freddie Prinze Jr. stars as Ryan Dunne, a ballplayer who's spending the summer as a pitcher for the famed, highly prestigious Cape Cod League, a non-professional farm team that has turned out numerous baseball legends. Ryan's under special pressure on a number of fronts. He's the first local boy to earn a slot in the league in years, and his blue-collar status earns him the enmity of a hot-shot college teammate, Eric Van Leemer (Corey Pearson). Although he's backed up by his best friend and team catcher Billy Brubaker (Matthew Lillard), Ryan adds more stress to his life by embarking on an affair with a beautiful, wealthy young Vassar graduate, Tenley Parrish (Jessica Biel), who's spending the summer on the Cape with her parents. Tenley is facing her own crisis as her father (Bruce Davison) pressures her to move to San Francisco and work with her uncle, though she'd rather remain in the East and become an architect. Summer Catch is the third onscreen teaming of Prinze and Lillard, and also stars Brian Dennehy, Wilmer Valderrama, Jason Gedrick, Fred Ward, and Brittany Murphy(n)</desc>

She's not the most popular pupil at school, and is regularly picked on by the cheerleader clique. However, all that could be about to change: after her estranged father dies, it's discovered that she's directly in line to the throne of a tiny European country. But first she must show she has the bearing and beauty necessary for the role - and her grandmother Queen Clarisse Renaldi's first impressions are far from positive. Can Mia prove her regal relative wrong?(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Friday the 13th</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Marcus Nispel seems to have a bit of thing for remakes, having remoulded The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in 2003, as well as Conan the Barbarian this year. However, in this slasher horror, Nispel compresses elements of the first four films in the Friday the 13th franchise, which started way back in 1980, into one blood-sodden whole. This retread gives some background as to why Jason Voorhees became such a relentlessly homicidal maniac, before getting on with the business of steel on flesh and bucketloads of gore, delivering the movie's raison d'être. Some weeks after his sister goes missing, Clay Miller's search for his sibling leads him to Crystal Lake, a remote, wooded campsite. Also arriving at the spot is a group of young revellers, intent on partying. But it's not long before the man with the hockey mask and machete pays them a visit that any survivors are unlikely to forget. Can any of them escape Voorhees' latest murderous rampage? Or will they all vanish like Clay's sister and her friends?(n)</desc>

But FBI agent Clarice Starling (this time played by Julianne Moore), who had interviewed him before his escape, cannot put him out of her mind. The reverse is also true: for a decade, Dr. Lecter never stopped thinking about her. When he is again being looked for by the police, he returns to the United States to find Starling. At the same time he is chased by one of his former patients, millionaire Mason Verger (Gary Oldman), whom he disfigured(n)</desc>

Knight) pregnant patient Noelle (Liza Lapira) is in a strange predicament: she has two uteruses, and one of her babies is growing faster than the other, indicating that she's been unfaithful to at least one of the fathers. And finally, Alex (Katherine Heigl) toys with the idea of retiring as a doctor and using her multi-million-dollar inheritance to start another business(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The film follows a Jewish family living in Hungary through three generations, and rising from humble beginnings to positions of wealth and power in the crumbling Austro-Hungarian Empire. Ignatz, the patriarch rises from poverty to become a prominent judge and model conservative. But his prosperity proves short-lived, since he must eventually confront the changing attitudes of the Hungarian majority. Ignatz is torn when his government sanctions Jewish persecutions, something that creates a rift between him and his beloved wife Valerie (played alternately by veteran actress Rosemary Harris and her daughter Jennifer Ehle), while his brother Gustave, fearful of the growing anti-semitic feeling, throws himself into Communism instead. His son Adam (also played by Fiennes) converts to Christianity to advance his career as a champion fencer and Olympic hero, but finds his patriotism rejected as he is inexorably caught up in the Holocaust. Finally, Istvan (Fiennes again), his grandson, who must constantly change his allegiances in order to survive the war, revolution, loss and betrayal, realizes that his ultimate loyalty must be to his family, his heritage, and himself(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The film follows a Jewish family living in Hungary through three generations, and rising from humble beginnings to positions of wealth and power in the crumbling Austro-Hungarian Empire. Ignatz, the patriarch rises from poverty to become a prominent judge and model conservative. But his prosperity proves short-lived, since he must eventually confront the changing attitudes of the Hungarian majority. Ignatz is torn when his government sanctions Jewish persecutions, something that creates a rift between him and his beloved wife Valerie (played alternately by veteran actress Rosemary Harris and her daughter Jennifer Ehle), while his brother Gustave, fearful of the growing anti-semitic feeling, throws himself into Communism instead. His son Adam (also played by Fiennes) converts to Christianity to advance his career as a champion fencer and Olympic hero, but finds his patriotism rejected as he is inexorably caught up in the Holocaust. Finally, Istvan (Fiennes again), his grandson, who must constantly change his allegiances in order to survive the war, revolution, loss and betrayal, realizes that his ultimate loyalty must be to his family, his heritage, and himself(n)</desc>

Ben (Jimmy Fallon) is a high-school teacher who meets Lindsay (Drew Barrymore), who has a successful career in business. Ben and Lindsay don't appear to have much in common on the surface, but they hit it off and are soon involved in a serious romance. But when spring rolls around, Lindsay becomes aware of the true love of Ben's life -- the Boston Red Sox. Despite the team's lamentable record, Ben has been a fiercely loyal Red Sox fan since childhood, and Lindsay finds it hard to compete with his passion for baseball, while Ben is forced to choose between the obsessions of his youth and the enthusiasms of a responsible adult. Fever Pitch was shot in part in Boston during the 2004 baseball season, which to the surprise of the filmmakers saw the Red Sox winning baseball's world series for the first time since 1918(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Fever Pitch</title>
    <desc lang="en">Nick Hornby's acclaimed memoir about one man's struggle to balance his love of a woman and his love for soccer was the basis of a well-reviewed British film in 1997, and now gets a Americanized rewrite with this picture, in which the game is changed from soccer to baseball. Ben (Jimmy Fallon) is a high-school teacher who meets Lindsay (Drew Barrymore), who has a successful career in business. Ben and Lindsay don't appear to have much in common on the surface, but they hit it off and are soon involved in a serious romance. But when spring rolls around, Lindsay becomes aware of the true love of Ben's life -- the Boston Red Sox. Despite the team's lamentable record, Ben has been a fiercely loyal Red Sox fan since childhood, and Lindsay finds it hard to compete with his passion for baseball, while Ben is forced to choose between the obsessions of his youth and the enthusiasms of a responsible adult. Fever Pitch was shot in part in Boston during the 2004 baseball season, which to the surprise of the filmmakers saw the Red Sox winning baseball's world series for the first time since 1918(n)</desc>

Bishop (Tupac Shakur), Q (Omar Epps), Raheem (Khalil Kain), and Steel (Jermaine Hopkins) are four Harlem friends who spend their days skipping school, getting in fights, and casually shoplifting. The only member of the group who has plans for the future is Q, who dreams of becoming a deejay. But one day Bishop happens to see James Cagney in White Heat and the film inspires him to buy a gun. His plan is to rob a corner store and split the money. Everyone goes along with the plan except for Q, who is competing that night in a deejay contest. At the club, Q is a rousing success, but he spies the stern faces of his friends through the cheering crowd and realizes that he has to go along with the robbery, which goes completely wrong(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Father of Invention</title>
    <desc lang="en">An entrepreneur with a world-class ego has to rebuild his empire and his family relationships from scratch in this comedy. Robert Axle (Kevin Spacey) built a multi-million-dollar business out of selling household gadgets through television infomercials, and managed to alienate nearly everyone around him when fame and wealth turned him into an arrogant loudmouth. When one of Axle's products turns out to be dangerous and causes several thousand customers to lose a finger, he loses his fortune and spends eight years in prison for gross negligence. Back on the street, Axle is broke but determined to find a way back to the top, though he's just a bit more humble than he used to be and wants to win back the love of his daughter, Claire (Camilla Belle), whom he neglected as a child, and his ex-wife (Virginia Madsen). Things go badly for Axle on his first day working at a big-box discount store, and he's left with little alternative than to ask Claire to let him stay with her; she and her roommate, Fibbi (Heather Graham), aren't so sure this is a good idea, but they grudgingly agree and end up helping Axle in his bid to redeem himself. Father of Invention also stars Johnny Knoxville, Craig Robinson, and Michael Rosenbaum(n)</desc>
