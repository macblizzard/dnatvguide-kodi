Using a non-linear plot structure, the film explores different perspectives of the quadruple homicide that occurred on July 1, 1981, in the Hollywood Hills. At the lowest point of his career and the height of his drug addiction, Holmes was implicated in the murders of the Wonderland gang: Ron Launius (Josh Lucas), Billy Deverell (Tim Blake Nelson), Barbara Richardson (Natasha Gregson Wagner), and Joy Miller (Janeane Garofalo). Launius' wife, Susan (Christina Applegate), was the only survivor. Led by Detective Sam Nico (Ted Levine), the police investigation reveals a dark criminal underworld surrounding Holmes, his disapproving wife, Sharon (Lisa Kudrow), and his innocent teenage girlfriend, Dawn Schiller (Kate Bosworth). Eric Bogosian stars as notorious Hollywood nightclub owner Eddie Nash. Wonderland premiered at the 2003 Toronto Film Festival(n)</desc>

Pakula, tells the story of prosecutor Rusty Sabich (Harrison Ford) who is accused of murdering his mistress Caroline (Greta Scacchi) and must prove his innocence. Sabich, a successful prosecutor, whose marriage is shaken by his wife Barbara's (Bonnie Bedelia) discovery of his affair, finds himself in a nightmare when his former mistress is found dead and all the physical evidence points to him; even his wife seems to believe that he is guilty. Ford is excellent in his role as Sabich, convincing both as an attorney and as a man who wants to take his formerly happy life back. Bonnie Bedelia is wonderful as Sabich's unforgiving wife, and gives a compelling, enigmatic performance in a difficult role. Presumed Innocent both a plausible, believable courtroom drama and an exciting murder mystery is highly recommended(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Charlie Wilson's War</title>
    <desc lang="en">Produced by Tom Hanks, written by Aaron Sorkin, and directed by Mike Nichols, this adaptation of George Crile III's incendiary bestseller tells the remarkable story of the Texas congressman whose efforts to prevent the Red Army from overtaking Afghanistan eventually led to the collapse of the Soviet Union while simultaneously fueling the rise of radical Islam. In the early 1980s, a hastily assembled army of Afghan "freedom fighters" achieved the remarkable feat of fending off Soviet invaders despite the fact that the odds were overwhelmingly stacked against them. At the time, Texas congressman Charlie Wilson (Hanks) was a key member of the hugely powerful House Appropriations Committee. Illuminated to the specifics of this remarkable war by a high-profile Houston socialite, Wilson spearheaded an effort to provide hundreds of millions of dollars in weapons and training to the Mujahideen with more than a little help from brilliant but prickly CIA operative Gust Avrokotos(n)</desc>

Back in her teens, Marni (Bell) was a little awkward. These days she's a successful career woman, but the memories of being tormented by popular cheerleader Joanna (Yustman) still make her break into a cold sweat. Flying home for her brother's Will's wedding, Marni realizes to her horror that she will soon be sister-in-law to the pompon-wielding mean girl who once humiliated her in front of the entire student body. And apparently her nemesis learned from the best, because back when Marni's mom (Jamie Lee Curtis) was in high school, Joanna's aunt (Sigourney Weaver) served up the same kind of treatment. Now that they're about to become family, Marni and her mom do their best to let bygones be bygones. But old grudges die hard, and by the time the wedding bells chime, these old foes will already have some saucy stories to share with their grandchildren(n)</desc>

Mark (Freaky Friday) Waters' teen comedy is a cut above the rest, thanks to a smart screenplay from Saturday Night Live regular Tina Fey (based on Rosalind Wiseman's non-fiction survival guide for young girls, Queen Bees and Wannabees ) and outstanding performances not just from Lohan, but the whole cast (watch out for Tim Meadows as the scene-stealing Principal Duvall)(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A high-powered PR professional discovers that her brother is about to marry the woman who made her high school life a living hell in this comedy starring Kristen Bell and Odette Yustman. Back in her teens, Marni (Bell) was a little awkward. These days she's a successful career woman, but the memories of being tormented by popular cheerleader Joanna (Yustman) still make her break into a cold sweat. Flying home for her brother's Will's wedding, Marni realizes to her horror that she will soon be sister-in-law to the pompon-wielding mean girl who once humiliated her in front of the entire student body. And apparently her nemesis learned from the best, because back when Marni's mom (Jamie Lee Curtis) was in high school, Joanna's aunt (Sigourney Weaver) served up the same kind of treatment. Now that they're about to become family, Marni and her mom do their best to let bygones be bygones. But old grudges die hard, and by the time the wedding bells chime, these old foes will already have some saucy stories to share with their grandchildren(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This weekly, syndicated children's reality show was packaged by Steve Rotfeld Productions, the same firm responsible for such similar FCC-friendly efforts as Awesome Adventures and Wild About Animals. Hosted by Christine Long, the series used actual footage and re-enactments to show its target audience (kids aged 13 to 16) how to confront and cope with extraordinary situations, many of them dangerous in nature. Typical episodes demonstrated CPR techniques, the extinguishing of household fires, and the handling of moral dilemmas. Also offered were tips on building, cooking and general housekeeping, with added input from experts in these fields. Offering three to four "features" per half hour episode, WHADDAYDO? was first distributed by TVI Media beginning the week of September 12, 2005(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Quick and the Dead</title>
    <desc lang="en">This western borrows many conventions from the films of Sergio Leone as it follows the exploits of a female gunslinger involved in a bloody quick-draw contest. Sharon Stone is the female version of "the man with no name." She rides back into her hometown of Redemption looking only for vengeance against Herod (Gene Hackman) the reigning gunslinger. Redemption is under the control of Herod, who uses his strong arm to keep the locals in line and takes 50 cents of every dollar. Every year there is a quick-draw competition in Redemption and while some come to make a name for themselves, or collect the money, Ellen is here to take out Herod. The rest is a series of standoffs, as contenders quickly fall away, revealing who the quickest really is. The colorful cast of characters includes: Kid (Leonardo DiCaprio) who is Herod's son and desperately trying to get out of his shadow, Cort (Russell Crowe), a killer turned preacher who Herod forces into the competition, and many others. Raimi was hand-picked by Stone to direct this spaghetti western and if anything is notable about this film, it's Raimi's contribution. The performances are all well done, despite the fact that Hackman can do this role in his sleep and Stone is trying way too hard to be tough; but this thin plot only carries so far, and it's Raimi's unique visuals that keep things interesting, even when they get ridiculous. More a remake of a Sergio Leone-style western than a darker update of the genre -- what most westerns made in the 90's tried to be -- this western has fun with itself and never really takes itself too seriously(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Grand Visions is a short season of films driven by the vision and boldness of strong directors; passion projects made on a grand and uncompromising scale. The season kicks off with director Baz Luhrmann's western/ war adventure/ romance hybrid that's set in the Australian outback and stars Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman. It is 1939 and Lady Sarah Ashley has travelled halfway round the world to persuade her husband to sell his cattle station and return back home to Blighty. It's soon obvious that she hasn't anticipated the primitive realities of life in northern Australia, nor has her upbringing prepared her for an encounter with the likes of the rough and ready drover who is instructed to chaperone her from Darwin to the ranch. But the pair are fated to become much more closely acquainted than either could have imagined. The plot also encompasses the lot of the region's Aboriginal people, via the plight of local lad Nullah, and the first Japanese attacks on the northern territories. Edited for language(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Gregg Wallace and Cherry Healey return with the programme shedding light on how some of Britain's biggest factories make the nation's favourite products, beginning with popular breakfast cereals. Gregg starts by receiving a boat-load of corn fresh from Argentina, and witnesses as it is cooked, milled and flavoured to become a top-selling cereal brand. Cherry learns about the immunity-boosting powers of vitamin D, which is added to many of the UK's most popular cereals, and historian Ruth Gordon samples a Victorian breakfast of lobster and pig's head, as part of a daily meal that included 4,500 calories.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Katie Derham makes use of archive footage and family records to tell the story of how Vera Lynn came to become one of the UK's most well-known musical stars. Vera celebrates her 100th birthday on March 20th, and marks the occasion by reminiscing about her early days in showbusiness, with help from her daughter Virginia. She recalls starting out as Vera Welch in the 1920s, first appearing on stage at the tender age of seven, before charming the nation's servicemen and becoming the `forces sweetheart' during the Second World War. She also remembers becoming the first British artist to achieve a number one in America in the 1950s, and a similar feat in 2009, when she became the oldest living singer to reach the same position in the UK charts. Along the way, Second World War veterans and entertainment industry figures - including Paul McCartney, Barry Humphries and Miriam Margolyes - pay tribute to the power of her voice.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Although it is closed and secretive, Buckingham Palace has become a symbol of everything British, despite only being a royal palace for less that 200 years. This second of two programmes reflects on previous monarchs' accomplishments during their reign, from Edward VII's commitment in 1901 to making the palace a royal stage, to George V's decision to change the family name from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to Windsor. Finally, the programme considers the next King, who could bring about another revolution at the palace and change its role further in the future.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The countdown of memorable moments from the comedy scene draws to a close, with examples from both sides of the Atlantic. Highlighted are the launches of the raucous 1980s student sitcom The Young Ones and the satirical puppet show Spitting Image, the controversy surrounding Monty Python's Life of Brian, and the much deplored `Sachsgate' scandal of 2008, which saw the tide of public opinion turn against popular BBC presenters Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross after they played an ill-conceived prank on Fawlty Towers star Andrew Sachs live on air on Radio 2. The show also highlights more poignant moments, including Joan Rivers' trail-blazing debut on The Tonight Show back in 1965, and Tommy Cooper's death while live on stage in 1985. Featuring David Baddiel, Keith Allen, Jim Davidson, Jenny Eclair and Nina Wadia.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Rush Hour 3</title>
    <desc lang="en">Brett Ratner's martial-arts action-comedy sequel starring Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan.

    <title lang="en">The Ring</title>
    <desc lang="en">A disturbing videotape appears to hold the power of life and death over those who view it in this offbeat thriller. A strange videotape begins making the rounds in a town in the Pacific Northwest; it is full of bizarre and haunting images, and after watching it, many viewers receive a telephone call in which they are warned they will die in seven days. A handful of teenagers who watched the tape while spending a weekend at a cabin in the mountains scoff at the threat, but as predicted, they all die suddenly on the same night. Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts), the aunt of one of the ill-fated teens, is a journalist who has decided to investigate the matter and travels West with her young son, Aidan (David Dorfman), a troubled child who has been drawing pictures of strange and ominous visions. Rachel managed to find the cabin in the woods and watches the video herself; afterward, she receives the same phone call, and realizes she must solve the puzzle of the video and the person or persons behind it within a week. Rachel turns to her ex, Noah (Martin Henderson), an expert in video technology, who at first is convinced the story is a hoax until he digs deeper into the mystery. The Ring was adapted from a 1996 Japanese film by Hideo Nakata, which became a massive box-office success in Asia and spawned two sequels(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Ring</title>
    <desc lang="en">A disturbing videotape appears to hold the power of life and death over those who view it in this offbeat thriller. A strange videotape begins making the rounds in a town in the Pacific Northwest; it is full of bizarre and haunting images, and after watching it, many viewers receive a telephone call in which they are warned they will die in seven days. A handful of teenagers who watched the tape while spending a weekend at a cabin in the mountains scoff at the threat, but as predicted, they all die suddenly on the same night. Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts), the aunt of one of the ill-fated teens, is a journalist who has decided to investigate the matter and travels West with her young son, Aidan (David Dorfman), a troubled child who has been drawing pictures of strange and ominous visions. Rachel managed to find the cabin in the woods and watches the video herself; afterward, she receives the same phone call, and realizes she must solve the puzzle of the video and the person or persons behind it within a week. Rachel turns to her ex, Noah (Martin Henderson), an expert in video technology, who at first is convinced the story is a hoax until he digs deeper into the mystery. The Ring was adapted from a 1996 Japanese film by Hideo Nakata, which became a massive box-office success in Asia and spawned two sequels(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May are in Russia as the motoring magazine returns, taking part in a race across the urban landscape of St Petersburg. James defends the honour of the car in a very small Renault, Richard tries to prove that pedalling is faster by riding a bicycle, while Jeremy attempts to demonstrate that water is the quickest way across town by piloting a hovercraft. To make matters more complicated, all three presenters are racing not only one another but also the Stig, who is making his way toward the finish line by public transport. Plus, the new Lamborghini Huracan is put through its paces and singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran takes to the test track in the Reasonably Priced Car.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May embark on a project to build a car that can turn into a hovercraft and bring relief to flooded areas. Their efforts do not start smoothly, but it is not long before the trio are demonstrating the brilliance of their creation with an eventful journey down the River Avon. Plus, Jeremy grabs the keys to two variants of the Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG supercar - the V8-engined Black Series with a roaring 622bhp, and the 740bhp Electric Drive, which is powered by four electric motors.

Upon their return to Philadelphia, Rocky and his wife, Adrian (Talia Shire), discover they are broke, their fortune squandered by an incompetent accountant. Forced to move back to their working-class neighborhood, Rocky finds that his only asset is the run-down gym willed to him by Mickey (Burgess Meredith, who appears in new flashback sequences). Resisting big money offered to him by Don King-like boxing promoter George Washington Duke (Richard Gant), Rocky becomes a trainer and finds a talented comer in Tommy Gunn (real-life boxer Tommy Morrison, nephew of John Wayne). Rocky's son (played by Stallone's real-life son Sage Stallone) feels neglected by his father, who lavishes attention on his protégé, but Tommy ultimately turns his back on his mentor to sign a more lucrative deal with Duke, leading to a street-fight showdown(n)</desc>

Tom Skerritt and Vincent Spano are also featured in the supporting cast; the screenplay, adapted from a script by John Milius, was at one time set to be filmed by Sam Peckinpah, shortly before the legendary Western director's death in 1984(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">After sandblasting away years of camp and bad scripts from the Gamera franchise to form a couple of tight-scripted, vastly entertaining flicks, Shusuke Kaneko gives the same treatment to the granddaddy of kaiju eiga characters: Godzilla. The film opens with Godzilla waking up from his underwater hideaway. Unseen since his 1954 attack on Tokyo, the monster is spotted by a Japanese submarine. Though government officials seem reluctant to confront the problem, Navy Admiral Tachibana (Ryudo Uzaki), who witnessed the rampage when he was a child, is more than a little alarmed. Meanwhile, Tachibana's daughter Yuri (Chiharu Niiyama), who works at a struggling TV station, is making a documentary in the mountains of Niigata Prefecture. One night, they experience a massive earthquake and that next morning they learn that a gang of motorcycle punks were crushed in a mountain tunnel and witnesses reportedly saw some sort of fire-breathing creature in the rubble. Later, a group of campers in southern Kagoshima prefecture are crushed by some Thing that crawled out of Lake Ikeda.

He also rustles up his own version of lamb biryani with a Bombay mix crust, creates giant poppadoms measuring almost a metre wide, and serves a new type of lager - `beeryani', infused with rice and pandan leaves. As a final nod to the British curry house experience, the chef makes a giant After Eight-inspired dessert, and dishes up his unique menu in a pop-up restaurant on the outskirts of Bradford.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Heston Blumenthal discovers that curry house classics such as vindaloo, bhuna, phal and onion bhaji were all invented in Britain, as he puts his own stamp on the most famous of them all - injecting whole poussins with tikka marinade and stuffing them with tikka masala. He also rustles up his own version of lamb biryani with a Bombay mix crust, creates giant poppadoms measuring almost a metre wide, and serves a new type of lager - `beeryani', infused with rice and pandan leaves. As a final nod to the British curry house experience, the chef makes a giant After Eight-inspired dessert, and dishes up his unique menu in a pop-up restaurant on the outskirts of Bradford.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Happening</title>
    <desc lang="en">Lady in the Water director M. Night Shyamalan puts PG-13 suspense on pause to tell this grim apocalyptic tale about a family fleeing a natural disaster that poses a grave threat to the whole of humanity. Philadelphia high-school science teacher Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) is discussing the disappearance of the bees with his students when the staff is summoned to the theater and briefed about a mysterious event that is currently unfolding in New York City. According to reports, citizens in the vicinity of Central Park have suddenly and inexplicably begun seizing up just before killing themselves by whatever means are at their disposal. As the phenomena begins to spread and talk of terrorism fills the airwaves, Elliot, his wife, Alma (Zooey Deschanel), their friend Julian (John Leguizamo), and his daughter, Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez), board a train bound for the presumed safety of the country. When the train screeches to a halt before arriving at its final destination, however, the frightened passengers are forced to fend for themselves as each consecutive news report paints an increasingly grim picture of the situation in more urbanized areas. Theories abound on what could be causing the unexplainable rash of suicides, but the only thing that everyone seems to agree on is that it's some kind of airborne contagion that is carried in the wind. It would appear that humankind's reign on planet Earth has come to an end, but perhaps if this small band of survivors can find a safe place to lie low until this all blows over, all hope for survival of the species might not be lost just yet(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Happening</title>
    <desc lang="en">Lady in the Water director M. Night Shyamalan puts PG-13 suspense on pause to tell this grim apocalyptic tale about a family fleeing a natural disaster that poses a grave threat to the whole of humanity. Philadelphia high-school science teacher Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) is discussing the disappearance of the bees with his students when the staff is summoned to the theater and briefed about a mysterious event that is currently unfolding in New York City. According to reports, citizens in the vicinity of Central Park have suddenly and inexplicably begun seizing up just before killing themselves by whatever means are at their disposal. As the phenomena begins to spread and talk of terrorism fills the airwaves, Elliot, his wife, Alma (Zooey Deschanel), their friend Julian (John Leguizamo), and his daughter, Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez), board a train bound for the presumed safety of the country. When the train screeches to a halt before arriving at its final destination, however, the frightened passengers are forced to fend for themselves as each consecutive news report paints an increasingly grim picture of the situation in more urbanized areas. Theories abound on what could be causing the unexplainable rash of suicides, but the only thing that everyone seems to agree on is that it's some kind of airborne contagion that is carried in the wind. It would appear that humankind's reign on planet Earth has come to an end, but perhaps if this small band of survivors can find a safe place to lie low until this all blows over, all hope for survival of the species might not be lost just yet(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Writer and director Robert Rodriguez returns to the family-friendly adventure of his Spy Kids movies with this three-dimensional action opus. Max (Cayden Boyd) is a ten-year-old boy who doesn't get along with his peers and is constantly bullied at school. But Max has an active imagination, and he has a pair of very special imaginary playmates -- Shark Boy (Taylor Lautner), a human-shark half-breed cared for by a pack of great whites, and Lava Girl (Taylor Dooley), a girl with superpowers who can conjure heat and fire at will. Max may be a creative boy, but what he doesn't know is that Shark Boy and Lava Girl really do exist, and he is recruited to help them as they do battle against Mr. Electricity, a super-villain determined to deprive children of their sleep. Shot and originally released in the 3-D format, The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl also stars David Arquette and Kristin Davis as Max's parents, and George Lopez as a schoolteacher; writer and director Rodriguez wrote the film's story in collaboration with his then seven-year-old son, Racer Rodriguez(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl</title>
    <desc lang="en">Writer and director Robert Rodriguez returns to the family-friendly adventure of his Spy Kids movies with this three-dimensional action opus. Max (Cayden Boyd) is a ten-year-old boy who doesn't get along with his peers and is constantly bullied at school. But Max has an active imagination, and he has a pair of very special imaginary playmates -- Shark Boy (Taylor Lautner), a human-shark half-breed cared for by a pack of great whites, and Lava Girl (Taylor Dooley), a girl with superpowers who can conjure heat and fire at will. Max may be a creative boy, but what he doesn't know is that Shark Boy and Lava Girl really do exist, and he is recruited to help them as they do battle against Mr. Electricity, a super-villain determined to deprive children of their sleep. Shot and originally released in the 3-D format, The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl also stars David Arquette and Kristin Davis as Max's parents, and George Lopez as a schoolteacher; writer and director Rodriguez wrote the film's story in collaboration with his then seven-year-old son, Racer Rodriguez(n)</desc>

Mia Thermopolis is a pleasant, if slightly awkward and geeky, 15-year-old high school student living in San Francisco. She's not the most popular pupil at school, and is regularly picked on by the cheerleader clique. However, all that could be about to change: after her estranged father dies, it's discovered that she's directly in line to the throne of a tiny European country. But first she must show she has the bearing and beauty necessary for the role - and her grandmother Queen Clarisse Renaldi's first impressions are far from positive. Can Mia prove her regal relative wrong?(n)</desc>

But the host of the show, Prem Kumar (Anil Kapoor) is convinced he's cheating and hands him over to the police to beat the truth out of him. Jamal reveals that the right answer to each question has come from a significant part of his life, from when he and his brother Salim were orphaned after their mother was killed in religious violence. As he continues his story, Jamal reveals how he knows each answer; how he fell in love with Latika, an orphaned girl from whom he was later separated; and how his brother Salim took the path of violence as a gangster's gunman. But as Jamal is returned to the studio for the last question, Salim finally repays his brother's trust. As well as the outstanding Patel, Jamal is played in different stages of his life by Tanay Hemant Gharu and Ayush Mahesh Khedekar; Salim is played by Madhur Mittal, Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala and Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail; Latika is played by Frieda Pinto, Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar and Rubina Ali, all of whom turn in stunning performances.

    <title lang="en">The Voice UK</title>
    <desc lang="en">This year's contest draws to a close as the four finalists - Michelle John, Jamie Miller, Into the Ark and Mo Adeniran - take to the stage in the first part of the two-part climax. Having progressed through seven weeks of blind auditions, two battle rounds, four live knockout stages and the ever-tense quarter- and semi-finals, the would-be stars face the ultimate test of their vocal abilities, with the winner earning themselves a prestigious contract with Polydor Records. Superstar coaches Will.i.am, Tom Jones, Jennifer Hudson and Gavin Rossdale are on hand to share their thoughts as each performer steps down from the stage, with one of them being eliminated from the contest before the last programme of the series.(n)</desc>

Soon, a beautiful young woman who summers in the town with her family distracts Ryan. As the friction builds between his loyal townie friends and his cocky teammates, Ryan's rivalry with hotshot teammate Eric comes to a head.

    <title lang="en">1408</title>
    <desc lang="en">A writer renowned for debunking infamous paranormal events is confronted by a force that he cannot explain upon checking into room 1408 of the notoriously haunted Dolphin Hotel. Mike Enslin (John Cusack) is an author who specializes in horror, but who only believes in what he can see with his eyes and touch with his hands. Having constructed an entire career on his ability to dispel superstitious "haunted house" rumors, Mike is convinced that the afterlife is a manmade construct designed to offer false comfort to the weak minded. Mike's latest project is a book entitled "Ten Nights in Haunted Hotel Rooms," and it seems that in room 1408 of the Dolphin Hotel, this skeptical scribe may finally find proof of the supernatural. Implored by the hotel manager (Samuel L. Jackson) not to enter room 1408, Mike defiantly procures the key and prepares to dispel yet another spectral sham. Now, as is the case with many of life's most profound epiphanies, the writer who thought he knew it all is caught entirely off guard at the precise moment he least expected it. Subsequently faced with undeniable proof of an afterlife, Mike may have a best-seller on his hands if he can simply survive until sunrise. Mary McCormack and Jasmine Jessica Anthony co-star in director Mikael Håfström's (Derailed) adaptation of an original short story by horror icon Stephen King(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">1408</title>
    <desc lang="en">A writer renowned for debunking infamous paranormal events is confronted by a force that he cannot explain upon checking into room 1408 of the notoriously haunted Dolphin Hotel. Mike Enslin (John Cusack) is an author who specializes in horror, but who only believes in what he can see with his eyes and touch with his hands. Having constructed an entire career on his ability to dispel superstitious "haunted house" rumors, Mike is convinced that the afterlife is a manmade construct designed to offer false comfort to the weak minded. Mike's latest project is a book entitled "Ten Nights in Haunted Hotel Rooms," and it seems that in room 1408 of the Dolphin Hotel, this skeptical scribe may finally find proof of the supernatural. Implored by the hotel manager (Samuel L. Jackson) not to enter room 1408, Mike defiantly procures the key and prepares to dispel yet another spectral sham. Now, as is the case with many of life's most profound epiphanies, the writer who thought he knew it all is caught entirely off guard at the precise moment he least expected it. Subsequently faced with undeniable proof of an afterlife, Mike may have a best-seller on his hands if he can simply survive until sunrise.

    <title lang="en">Darkness Falls</title>
    <desc lang="en">Children have a very good reason to be afraid of the dark in this flashy horror story. Matilda Dixon was a genially eccentric woman who, in the 1850s, lived in a New England town known as Darkness Falls. Matilda was well known to the local children for her habit of paying them for teeth they'd lost, but when two youngsters mysteriously disappeared, Matilda was lynched by an angry mob wrongly convinced that she had murdered the kids. In the year 2002, former Darkness Falls resident Kyle Walsh (Chaney Kley) lives in Las Vegas and is still desperately afraid of the dark since a childhood run-in with the ghost of Matilda Dixon left him severely traumatized. While police and psychiatrists scoffed at Kyle's stories about Matilda's spirit, his childhood friend Caitlin (Emma Caulfield) is alarmed when her nine-year-old brother Michael (Lee Cormie) begins having nightmares very much like those which disturbed Kyle's rest for years. Like Kyle, Michael has little luck convincing most grown-ups that the white-robed specters he sees in the dark are real, so Caitlin asks Kyle to return to Darkness Falls to help get to the bottom of his story. Darkness Falls marked the directorial debut of filmmaker Jonathan Liebesman(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Darkness Falls</title>
    <desc lang="en">Children have a very good reason to be afraid of the dark in this flashy horror story. Matilda Dixon was a genially eccentric woman who, in the 1850s, lived in a New England town known as Darkness Falls. Matilda was well known to the local children for her habit of paying them for teeth they'd lost, but when two youngsters mysteriously disappeared, Matilda was lynched by an angry mob wrongly convinced that she had murdered the kids. In the year 2002, former Darkness Falls resident Kyle Walsh (Chaney Kley) lives in Las Vegas and is still desperately afraid of the dark since a childhood run-in with the ghost of Matilda Dixon left him severely traumatized. While police and psychiatrists scoffed at Kyle's stories about Matilda's spirit, his childhood friend Caitlin (Emma Caulfield) is alarmed when her nine-year-old brother Michael (Lee Cormie) begins having nightmares very much like those which disturbed Kyle's rest for years. Like Kyle, Michael has little luck convincing most grown-ups that the white-robed specters he sees in the dark are real, so Caitlin asks Kyle to return to Darkness Falls to help get to the bottom of his story. Darkness Falls marked the directorial debut of filmmaker Jonathan Liebesman(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">1408</title>
    <desc lang="en">A writer renowned for debunking infamous paranormal events is confronted by a force that he cannot explain upon checking into room 1408 of the notoriously haunted Dolphin Hotel. Mike Enslin (John Cusack) is an author who specializes in horror, but who only believes in what he can see with his eyes and touch with his hands. Having constructed an entire career on his ability to dispel superstitious "haunted house" rumors, Mike is convinced that the afterlife is a manmade construct designed to offer false comfort to the weak minded. Mike's latest project is a book entitled "Ten Nights in Haunted Hotel Rooms," and it seems that in room 1408 of the Dolphin Hotel, this skeptical scribe may finally find proof of the supernatural. Implored by the hotel manager (Samuel L. Jackson) not to enter room 1408, Mike defiantly procures the key and prepares to dispel yet another spectral sham. Now, as is the case with many of life's most profound epiphanies, the writer who thought he knew it all is caught entirely off guard at the precise moment he least expected it. Subsequently faced with undeniable proof of an afterlife, Mike may have a best-seller on his hands if he can simply survive until sunrise. Mary McCormack and Jasmine Jessica Anthony co-star in director Mikael Håfström's (Derailed) adaptation of an original short story by horror icon Stephen King(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Meskada</title>
    <desc lang="en">Class and economics muddy the investigation of a homicide in this thriller from director Josh Sternfeld. When a child is found murdered in the small town of Hilliard, police detective Noah Cordin (Nick Stahl) is assigned to investigate the case. The victim's mother, Allison Connor (Laura Benanti), is a wealthy and well-connected member of the County Board of Commissioners, so Cordin is under pressure to find the killer as soon as possible, but working with rookie officer Leslie Spencer (Rachel Nichols), he isn't finding many substantial clues. One of the few pieces of evidence suggests the culprit may have been from the nearby town of Caswell. Cordin was born and raised in Caswell and knows its history well -- while Hilliard is a prosperous suburban community, Caswell is a working-class town fallen on hard times, and its survival is dependent on a proposed factory coming into town. As Cordin spends more and more time in Caswell, he becomes a target for the resentment the locals feel toward their wealthier neighbors, and a tense situation becomes potentially explosive when word begins to circulate that Connor may use her influence to keep the new employer out of Caswell unless someone comes forward to identity who killed her son. Meskada (named for the county that contains both Hilliard and Caswell) also stars Norman Reedus, Kellan Lutz, Jonathan Tucker, and Grace Gummer(n)</desc>

When Annie finds out the truth, Alex decides to apologise by taking her on a romantic cruise. But fate conspires to ruin their holiday when disgruntled ex-employee Geiger (Willem Dafoe) decides to forego an industrial tribunal in favour of blowing up the boat owned by the company which fired him! As the now out-of-control cruise ship hurtles towards potential destruction and Annie gets herself into a series of risky scrapes, Alex dangles, dives, swings and leaps his way around the ship, rescuing passengers in distress and desperately searching for a way to prevent his romantic cruise from having an explosive ending(n)</desc>

Saturday Night Live's David Spade is among the leading players; while he's funnier here than in his costarring stints in Chris Farley's films, he doesn't have much to work with.

    <desc lang="en">An entrepreneur with a world-class ego has to rebuild his empire and his family relationships from scratch in this comedy. Robert Axle (Kevin Spacey) built a multi-million-dollar business out of selling household gadgets through television infomercials, and managed to alienate nearly everyone around him when fame and wealth turned him into an arrogant loudmouth. When one of Axle's products turns out to be dangerous and causes several thousand customers to lose a finger, he loses his fortune and spends eight years in prison for gross negligence. Back on the street, Axle is broke but determined to find a way back to the top, though he's just a bit more humble than he used to be and wants to win back the love of his daughter, Claire (Camilla Belle), whom he neglected as a child, and his ex-wife (Virginia Madsen). Things go badly for Axle on his first day working at a big-box discount store, and he's left with little alternative than to ask Claire to let him stay with her; she and her roommate, Fibbi (Heather Graham), aren't so sure this is a good idea, but they grudgingly agree and end up helping Axle in his bid to redeem himself. Father of Invention also stars Johnny Knoxville, Craig Robinson, and Michael Rosenbaum(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Tim Allen and Chiwetel Ejiofor co-star in writer/director David Mamet's martial arts drama Redbelt. Ejiofor plays Mike Terry, a jujitsu master who co-runs a very modest martial arts studio in Los Angeles with his bossy wife, Sondra (Alice Braga). Mike demonstrates an unwavering commitment to his craft and draws a cadre of defiantly loyal pupils including Joe (Max Martini), an LAPD cop. All told, it appears that he has chosen a peaceful and conflict-free path in life. The dedicated martial artist's fate takes an unanticipated turn, however, one evening when a young woman named Laura (Emily Mortimer) bursts into the academy in a state of near hysteria, and reaches for a policeman's gun when he tries to restrain her. One thing leads to another, and before long, Laura is regularly receiving martial arts lessons from Mike. As master begins to teach pupil and his martial arts philosophies emerge, his path also crisscrosses with that of a Hollywood movie star, Chet Frank (Tim Allen), when he saves the fellow from a beating at a local club and gets invited (along with Sondra) to Chet's house for dinner. Chet extends gestures of friendship, and Mike's guard breaks down; he speaks openly and candidly of a special martial arts method he employs that requires one of the participants to "assume a handicap." In time, the association with Chet leads to involvement in the motion-picture industry, and relations with a bevy of characters who aren't exactly what they seem -- including a pay-per-view fight mogul (Ricky Jay) and Chet's slimy and manipulative manager (Joe Mantegna)(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">The Changing of the Guard</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The Changing of the Guard. Written by Rod Serling, this nostalgic Twilight Zone episode was clearly inspired by Serling's student years at Ohio's Antioch College. Made up to look twice his age, Donald Pleasence stars as Prof. Ellis Fowler, the oldest teacher at an exclusive boy's school. Ordered by his headmaster (Liam Sullivan) to retire, Fowler is convinced that his life has been meaningless -- until he is paid a nocturnal visit by several ethereal-looking "alumni." Telecast June 1, 1962, "The Changing of the Guard" was scheduled as the final Twilight Zone of the 1961-62 season -- and at the time, it looked as if it would be the last Twilight Zone, period. Though the series would ultimately be renewed in January of 1963, it would never completely rescale the creative heights of its first three seasons(n)</desc>

At a loss to explain this and other curiosities to his fiancée Jessica Connelly (Gail Kobe), Alan determines to get to the bottom of things. Meanwhile, the viewers would like a few answers of their own -- namely, why did Alan murder a harmless old woman before the first commercial? Scripted by Charles Beaumont from his own short story, "In His Image" was the first of Twilight Zone's 60-minute episodes, and it originally aired January 3, 1963(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Young Man's Fancy. According to this Richard Matheson-scripted Twilight Zone episode, there is such a thing as too much nostalgia. While visiting his childhood home with his new wife Virginia (Phyllis Thaxter), Alex Walker (Alex Nicol) begins exulting over the artifiacts of his youth -- toys, books, clothes, and the like. What Virginia doesn't know until it's too late is that Alex has fallen under the spell of his late mother (Helen Brown), who intends to reclaim her "little boy" at any cost. The ending is hardly satisfactory, but this cannot be blamed on Matheson, who had an entirely different (and infinitely more suitable) denoument in mind. "Young Man's Fancy" was originally telecast May 11, 1962(n)</desc>

In their efforts to win a huge raise, Al (Ed O'Neill) and Griff (Harold Sylvester) resort to blackmail when they discover that their boss Gary is using illegal aliens to manufacture her shoes. Unfortunately, the plan fizzles (despite an extended takeoff of the Mission: Impossible films), and Al's son Bud (David Faustino) ends up atoning for his dad's sins.

    <desc lang="en">Immaturity and poor sportsmanship once again find their firmly established place in children's athletics (at least among the adults) in this sports comedy. Phil Weston (Will Ferrell) is a tightly wound suburban father who had a competitive streak worn into him by his father, Buck (Robert Duvall), who never seemed to feel that his son measured up. When Phil's son joins a Little League soccer team, Phil signs on as coach, only to learn that Buck -- who also has a ten-year-old son these days -- will be coaching a team in the same league. Determined to show his father he can do the job, Phil impresses upon his young charges that winning is the only important thing, and soon gains a few enemies as he humiliates not only the kids on his own team, but their opponents as well. Directed by Jesse Dylan, Kicking &amp; Screaming also features Kate Walsh and legendary football coach Mike Ditka. The screenplay was authored by Steve Rudnick and Leo Benvenuti (The Santa Clause) prior to the latter's death in 2000(n)</desc>

The vampires have concocted a misinformation campaign that paints a picture of Blade as a ruthless murderer and has sent the FBI on the vampire hunter's trail, led by the relentless agent Cumberland (James Remar). At the same time, the vampires have brought their founding father, Dracula, back to his undead state, renaming him Drake (Dominic Purcell) and investing him with special powers that allow him to walk unharmed in daylight. After a dangerous encounter with Cumberland, Blade and his ally, Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), form an uneasy alliance with a scruffy team of human vampire slayers, the Nighstalkers, led by Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds), and Whistler's daughter, Abigail (Jessica Biel. While Sommerfield (Natasha Lyonne), a biologist working with the Nightstalkers, researches a scientific answer to the vampire problem, Blade and his comrades take a more hands-on approach against Drake and his minions, including Danica Talos (Parker Posey), Asher (Callum Keith Rennie), and Grimwood (Triple H). Blade: Trinity was directed by David Goyer, who also wrote the screenplay for this film, as well as the first two movies in the series(n)</desc>
