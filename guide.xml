    <title lang="en">Sweet Dreams</title>
    <desc lang="en">Sweet Dreams stars Jessica Lange as country-western singer Patsy Cline, whose tragic death in 1963 cut short one of the most fabulous success stories in the annals of popular music. Robert Getchell's screenplay goes the usual route of contrasting Cline's rise to fame in the years between 1956 and 1963 with her turbulent private life. As the wife of hard-drinking Charlie Dick (Ed Harris),Cline is subjected to all manner of abuse and humiliation, yet she stays with Charlie long beyond normal human endurance. A happy second marriage is all too short-lived--as is Cline herself. While the Cline-Dick relationship is presented relatively realistically, the film makes a number of chronological errors concerning Cline's "public" life. Also: how can anyone know what was being said in the last horrifying seconds before Cline's fatal plane crash? Unlike its role model Coal Miner's Daughter (in which Beverly D'Angelo played Cline), Sweet Dreams does not feature the voice of its star during the musical scenes; instead, actual recordings of Patsy Cline, electronically enhanced to match modern technology, are heard on the soundtrack. Song highlights include "Crazy," "I Fall to Pieces," and the title tune(n)</desc>

When top airplane engineer Ted Crawford discovers that his wife has been cheating on him he takes a devastatingly direct route to revenge: he drives home and shoots his errant spouse in the face. He then waits for the police to turn up and confesses to the crime. With his wife in a coma, Crawford is arrested and enters the justice system. It should, of course, be the simplest prosecution ever. And lawyer Willy Beachum can be forgiven for thinking that his last case as a criminal attorney (before he switches to company law) is set to be a doddle. However, once the case comes to court, Crawford, representing himself, proceeds to tear apart the ample evidence that's stacked against him. Can he possibly get away with his crime?

    <desc lang="en">A overgrown mama's boy who hasn't found the courage to take flight from the nest gets a little help from the girl of his dreams in the one comedy that proves it's never to late to strike out on your own. Tripp (Matthew McConaughey) may have hit 30, but that doesn't mean that he's ready to give up the many benefits of living at home with mom (Kathy Bates) and dad (Terry Bradshaw). His desperate parents have had enough, though, and after years of gentle nudging they soon realize that it's going to take a concerted effort to get Tripp out and enjoy their twilight years in peace. Realizing that their only hope for ridding themselves of their reluctant-to-leave offspring rides on the off-chance of his meeting the ideal female companion, mom and dad enlist the help of a beautiful and talented woman (Sarah Jessica Parker) in providing the romantic incentive needed to finally get their son out of the family home(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Crime of Passion: The Pamela Smart Story. Youth, seduction, and violence populate the landscape of the A&amp;E program American Justice: Crimes of Passion -- The Pamela Smart Story. As an attractive motivated schoolteacher, Pam Smart was carving out a successful middle-class life. But, inwardly, she was passionately dissatisfied. Her husband held her back, yet she couldn't afford to live alone. Then, Smart met teenager Bill Flynn. He fell for her and she seemed flattered by the attention. Eventually, their relationship became intimate and Smart found the answer to all her problems. Through manipulation and claims of abuse, she convinced her young lover to kill her husband and that's just what he did with the help of two friends. But, Smart's calculating manner gave her away when police suspected her of being less than grief-stricken. What followed was the first live broadcast trial in history. The media explosion surrounding the case was unparalleled. Smart turned out to be a lot less organized than she thought. When her killers caved and word got around of her arranged hit, she was doomed. A&amp;E takes the viewer back to the original trial of the century(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May embark on a race from London's Wembley Stadium to Milan's San Siro, the home of Italian football giants AC and Inter. A price restriction leads Jeremy to grab the keys to a Shelby Mustang GT500, which costs the equivalent of £35,000 in America and packs a supercharged punch of more than 650bhp. James and Richard pin their hopes on the pan-European rail network in a bid to secure the prize of tickets to a top-flight football match, with nothing but a long journey home awaiting the losers. On the test track, Jeremy puts Toyota's GT86 coupe through its paces, and its promise of entertaining rear-wheel-drive handling should put a smile on his face. Plus, singer-songwriter Amy Macdonald gets to grips with the Reasonably Priced Car.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In 1998, cinema-goers flocked to see Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, which featured arguably the most realistic and harrowing depiction of the D-Day landings ever captured on celluloid - then went on to tell the tale of a small unit on a mission to rescue a single American soldier whose brothers had all been killed in action. This documentary explores the historical accuracy of the opening battle scene, talking to one of the first men to make it to Omaha Beach on D-Day and testing the science behind some of the bullet and mortar shots. It also reveals the background to the US military's 1944 sole survivor policy, which inspired the movie.(n)</desc>

His latest adventure takes him from a submerged space station in Star City on the outskirts of Moscow, to Ethiopia, high above in the great Rift Valley, where he encounters the geladas, mankind's distant ancestors. Despite once being Africa's most successful primate, a species which at one time roamed across the entire continent, these days they are found in one just place in the remote Ethiopian Highlands. Cox investigates why these ancestors retreated, yet modern mankind has expanded across the planet.(n)</desc>

They pondered mankind's origins, realising there must have been a day with no yesterday - a day of creation - prompting the age-old question of where did the universe come from? Brian marvels that the universe seems to follow a set of rules, the laws of physics, allowing space to be considered on the grandest scale, travelling to the most distant, farthest reaches of the cosmos just by using our minds.

    <sub-title lang="en">What Is Our Future?.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Professor Brian Cox concludes his exploration of humanity's place in the cosmos by examining what the future holds. In Florida, he learns about the latest efforts to protect Earth from potential catastrophic events and joins a team of Nasa astronauts who are in a submerged laboratory that simulates space as they train for a future mission to an asteroid - should one ever be discovered heading to Earth. At the National Ignition Facility in California, the physicist witnesses the world's most successful fusion experiment in action, one which he believes may unlock a way to the stars that will not destroy the planet in the process. Last in the series.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Apeman - Spaceman.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Professor Brian Cox examines how it was that in a universe made of stars, rocks and endless space, a conscious civilisation was born. His latest adventure takes him from a submerged space station in Star City on the outskirts of Moscow, to Ethiopia, high above in the great Rift Valley, where he encounters the geladas, mankind's distant ancestors. Despite once being Africa's most successful primate, a species which at one time roamed across the entire continent, these days they are found in one just place in the remote Ethiopian Highlands. Cox investigates why these ancestors retreated, yet modern mankind has expanded across the planet.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Why Are We Here?.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">In episode two, Professor Brian Cox is off to India, where he assesses arguably the first evidence of rational thought in literature, the poetry of the Vedic monks. They pondered mankind's origins, realising there must have been a day with no yesterday - a day of creation - prompting the age-old question of where did the universe come from? Brian marvels that the universe seems to follow a set of rules, the laws of physics, allowing space to be considered on the grandest scale, travelling to the most distant, farthest reaches of the cosmos just by using our minds. Brian also visits Japan, and offers viewers the idea that man lives in just one of an infinite number of universes that are being made all the time.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Are We Alone?.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Is mankind alone, or are there aliens out there, either waiting to be discovered, or on their way to find Earth? Professor Brian Cox spends this episode asking such questions, and what he discovers may raise a few eyebrows. He begins by exploring the human race's efforts to find neighbours in outer space, including the launch of two golden discs containing a greeting from Earth in the 1970s; they are still travelling and are now the most distant man-made objects from the planet. Brian also meets members of the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence, who have been monitoring radio signals for 50 years without success, before discussing the ingredients needed to make an intelligent civilisation with astrophysicist Dr Frank Drake.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">A Place in Space and Time.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">On a trip to the fortified Moroccan village of Ait-Ben-Haddou in the Atlas Mountains, Professor Brian Cox reveals how by watching the stars' motion across the night sky, it is quite natural for man to think he is at the centre of everything. That view was held for many ages, but innate human curiosity has eventually led to an understanding of mankind's true place in space and time, and an appreciation that Earth is not a focal point but a mere particle of rock in a possibly infinite expanse of space, 13.8 billion years from the beginning of the universe.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A 21-year-old aspiring hip-hop star from the Bronx is forced to put his career on hold when a gang of local thugs threatens his life and he is forced to seek refuge with his estranged father in Puerto Rico in this musical drama from producer Jennifer Lopez. Rob (Omarion Grandberry) is a New York City rapper who has gotten into hot water in his hometown, and now must flee to Puerto Rico. Upon arriving at his father's home in the Caribbean commonwealth, Rob immediately forms a bond with his half-brother, Javi, who introduces his distant sibling to the seductive sounds of Reggaeton. Rob and Javi's outwardly divergent musical tastes ultimately blend to form a unique new brand of hip-hop-flavored reggae, and they soon begin to gain a loyal following that ultimately leads them both back to New York City. Yet despite Rob's growing popularity in the music industry, the gangsters back in the Bronx are still hell-bent on revenge, and willing to gun him down at the first chance they get. Is Rob's newfound status as a high-profile musical innovator enough to make him bulletproof, or could it be that he's more vulnerable than ever now that he's up on-stage for all the world to see?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The time-honored "men in drag" concept gets a teen sex comedy makeover with this farce from director Wallace Wolodarsky. Dave (Barry Watson), Adam (Michael Rosenbaum), and Doofer (Harland Williams) are a trio of broke playboy misogynists who are accused of embezzlement by their frat brothers and kicked out. The friends quickly find themselves with only one option if they wish to remain on campus rent-free and nab the real culprits: the sorority known as Delta Omicron Gamma (D.O.G.), an institution widely known for its members' deficiency of physical beauty. After undergoing radical transformations thanks to wigs, makeup, and some serious depilatory efforts, the boys are soon passing themselves off as Daisy, Adena, and Roberta. It's not long before their past mistreatment of women has come back to haunt them, while Dave falls in love with Leah (Melissa Sagemiller), the head of the sorority, forcing him to consider when and where to confess the truth. In the meantime, the boys draw closer to learning the identity of the real thieves. Sorority Boys (2002) co-stars Heather Matarazzo(n)</desc>

Only then will judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry decide who deserves the 2012 title. Presented by Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Four bakers remain in the hunt for the title of Britain's best amateur baker, but they all need to raise their game when they tackle a trio of classic patisserie confections in the semi-final. A petits fours-making challenge provides an early test of nerves, before the quartet face the toughest technical task in the show's history - creating a fraisier, a sponge cake filled with mousse and strawberries. As tempers rise and confidence falters, the contestants have one last chance to impress judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry by baking a showstopping choux gateau - before discovering who has earned a place in the 2012 final. Presented by Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc.(n)</desc>

Joel Barish and Clementine Kruczynski were once madly in love, but their affair has gone stale. And when they meet again by chance, she doesn't just blank him, she genuinely doesn't know him. Then Joel finds out the truth. Using a new and highly experimental technology, she is having her memories of him erased from her brain. In revenge, he's determined to undergo the same process but, as dodgy scientist Dr Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) begins the procedure, Joel changes his mind. Can he hang on to enough memories to win Clementine back?(n)</desc>

The first local boy in years to earn a slot in the team, Ryan finally got his shot but the temptations off-field are getting in the way of his commitment to the game. Soon, a beautiful young woman who summers in the town with her family distracts Ryan. As the friction builds between his loyal townie friends and his cocky teammates, Ryan's rivalry with hotshot teammate Eric comes to a head. When a major league scout comes along, however, he tries to push the pangs of romance and player rivalry aside, because his sports talent may be his only ticket out of the small industrial town(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A moment of temptation leads to a high body count and untold regrets for a high-school swimming star in this thriller starring Bring It On's Jesse Bradford and Traffic's Erika Christensen. Despite a shady past involving drugs and the juvenile justice system, Ben Cronin (Bradford) seems to have it all: a loving mother, a devoted girlfriend (Shiri Appleby), and a shot at a college scholarship in California. But the same week that athletic scouts will be deciding his future, Ben finds himself embroiled in a flirtation with Madison Bell (Christensen), a bewitching transfer student who seduces him into supposedly strings-free sex during an impromptu swim lesson after hours in the school pool. When Ben takes Madison at her word and goes about his business as if nothing had happened, she insinuates herself into his life with sinister glee. Showing up at Ben's house, befriending his girlfriend, and sending him naked pictures -- none of her strategies wins his heart. So Madison turns to other, more devious forms of courtship. Soon, Ben finds himself kicked off the swim team for supposed steroid use, suspected of murdering a rival (Clayne Crawford), and rejected by his girlfriend for his sexual indiscretions. Eventually, though, he receives help in uncovering the genesis of Madison's uncanny fixation from an unexpected source. Originally titled "Swimfan85" (after Madison's Internet screen name), the retitled Swimfan hit the top spot at the back-to-school box office when it was released September 6, 2002. Dan Hedaya co-stars as Ben's stern but loving mentor, Coach Simkins. Actor-turned-director John Polson previously helmed Siam Sunset(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Swimfan</title>
    <desc lang="en">A moment of temptation leads to a high body count and untold regrets for a high-school swimming star in this thriller starring Bring It On's Jesse Bradford and Traffic's Erika Christensen. Despite a shady past involving drugs and the juvenile justice system, Ben Cronin (Bradford) seems to have it all: a loving mother, a devoted girlfriend (Shiri Appleby), and a shot at a college scholarship in California. But the same week that athletic scouts will be deciding his future, Ben finds himself embroiled in a flirtation with Madison Bell (Christensen), a bewitching transfer student who seduces him into supposedly strings-free sex during an impromptu swim lesson after hours in the school pool. When Ben takes Madison at her word and goes about his business as if nothing had happened, she insinuates herself into his life with sinister glee. Showing up at Ben's house, befriending his girlfriend, and sending him naked pictures -- none of her strategies wins his heart. So Madison turns to other, more devious forms of courtship. Soon, Ben finds himself kicked off the swim team for supposed steroid use, suspected of murdering a rival (Clayne Crawford), and rejected by his girlfriend for his sexual indiscretions. Eventually, though, he receives help in uncovering the genesis of Madison's uncanny fixation from an unexpected source. Originally titled "Swimfan85" (after Madison's Internet screen name), the retitled Swimfan hit the top spot at the back-to-school box office when it was released September 6, 2002. Dan Hedaya co-stars as Ben's stern but loving mentor, Coach Simkins. Actor-turned-director John Polson previously helmed Siam Sunset(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">I Now Pronounce You Chuck &amp; Larry</title>
    <desc lang="en">When two testosterone-fueled firemen attempt to register as domestic partners in order to bypass the bureaucratic red tape preventing one of them from naming his own two children as his life-insurance beneficiaries, their low-key ruse turns into headline news in this quirky matrimonial comedy starring Adam Sandler and Kevin James. Chuck Levine (Sandler) and Larry Valentine (James) are two New York City firefighters whose longtime friendship has endured many a five-alarm fire. All that widower Larry wants is to ensure that his two children will be taken care of if anything should happen to him on the job, and all that single blaze-battler Chuck wants is to carry on with his carefree life of noncommitment. Having once rescued Larry from certain death in a particularly fearsome inferno, beholden Chuck feels forever indebted to his brave friend and has vowed to repay the favor when the time is right. When Larry discovers that the only means of circumventing the civic red tape that could throw his children's futures into jeopardy is to take Chuck as his lawfully wedded husband, his obligated pal reluctantly agrees to step up to the alter with the understanding that the arrangement will be a well-kept secret between themselves and the justice of the peace. A potentially fatal flaw in their presumably foolproof plan is soon revealed, however, when an overzealous bureaucrat decides to question Chuck and Larry's partnership. Subsequently forced to embark on a mandatory honeymoon and pose as starry-eyed newlyweds, Chuck and Larry quickly discover just how important it can be to stick by a friend in his or her time of need. Jessica Biel, Steve Buscemi, Ving Rhames, and Dan Aykroyd co-star in a comedy from The Benchwarmers director Dennis Dugan(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Set 100 miles south of the setting of the Polish brothers' first feature, Twin Falls Idaho, Jackpot tells the story of Sunny Holiday Jon Gries, a down-on-his-luck karaoke dweller who has hopes of becoming a country singer. He has abandoned his feisty wife Bobbi (Daryl Hannah) and young daughter to set off on a nine-month road odyssey with his manager Lester Irving (Garrett Morris), in an effort to collect cash at local karaoke gigs. Lester grooms Sunny by choosing what songs he will do, keeping up with what the judges are like, and negotiating with competitors like Sammy Bones (Mac Davis), another traveling hopeful. On his road journey, he encounters several women, including Janice (Peggy Lipton), a club waitress, and Cheryl (Crystal Bernard), whom he takes home after she has an accident in a restroom, only to find himself being enticed by her underage daughter Tangerine (Camellia Clouse). The road trip comes to a stop, however, when Sunny is pulled over by police who claim that his vehicle is stolen and that Bobbi has reported it. Sunny then seeks refuge with brother Tracy (Anthony Edwards) while he decides his next move. Jackpot is the first released film to be shot with the 24P HDTV camera, which was then blown up to Cinemascope 35 mm format(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">I Now Pronounce You Chuck &amp; Larry</title>
    <desc lang="en">When two testosterone-fueled firemen attempt to register as domestic partners in order to bypass the bureaucratic red tape preventing one of them from naming his own two children as his life-insurance beneficiaries, their low-key ruse turns into headline news in this quirky matrimonial comedy starring Adam Sandler and Kevin James. Chuck Levine (Sandler) and Larry Valentine (James) are two New York City firefighters whose longtime friendship has endured many a five-alarm fire. All that widower Larry wants is to ensure that his two children will be taken care of if anything should happen to him on the job, and all that single blaze-battler Chuck wants is to carry on with his carefree life of noncommitment. Having once rescued Larry from certain death in a particularly fearsome inferno, beholden Chuck feels forever indebted to his brave friend and has vowed to repay the favor when the time is right. When Larry discovers that the only means of circumventing the civic red tape that could throw his children's futures into jeopardy is to take Chuck as his lawfully wedded husband, his obligated pal reluctantly agrees to step up to the alter with the understanding that the arrangement will be a well-kept secret between themselves and the justice of the peace. A potentially fatal flaw in their presumably foolproof plan is soon revealed, however, when an overzealous bureaucrat decides to question Chuck and Larry's partnership. Subsequently forced to embark on a mandatory honeymoon and pose as starry-eyed newlyweds, Chuck and Larry quickly discover just how important it can be to stick by a friend in his or her time of need. Jessica Biel, Steve Buscemi, Ving Rhames, and Dan Aykroyd co-star in a comedy from The Benchwarmers director Dennis Dugan(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Dave Chappelle's Block Party</title>
    <desc lang="en">In September 2004, comedian Dave Chappelle took a break from his immensely successful Comedy Central show to stage a free, unpublicized, all-star hip-hop concert in the Clinton Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn, NY. Inviting fans over the Internet, on the street, and even in his family's hometown of Yellow Springs, OH, Chappelle asked filmmaker Michel Gondry to document the event from its inception on through to the performances themselves. The result is Dave Chappelle's Block Party, a concert film that provides not only a sampling of the music on display that September, but also an intimate look at the comedian himself. Gondry's cameras tag along with Chappelle as he visits Ohio, recruits a university marching band to play at the show, and surveys the opinions of Clinton Hill on the show that's about to take place. Along the way, we're introduced to some the comedian's favorite acts, in rehearsals and on-stage: Dead Prez, Jill Scott, Mos Def, the Roots, Erykah Badu, Kanye West, and the surprise reuniting of the Fugees(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Prediction: Murder. This episode is a followup to the previous week's offering, in which Jessica (Angela Lansbury) had renewed her friendship with former Air Force pilot Lee Goddard (Dale Robertson). Invited to visit Lee's ranch in Arizona, Jessica attends a party where a psychic named Franchesco (David Birney) is guest of honor. Much to the dismay of Lee's daughter-in-law Jill (Lisa Pelikan), two of Franchesco's grim predictions come true--and his third prediction has Jill meeting a horrible demise in a fire! Complicating matters is a murder and a kidnapping, obliging Jessica to cut her vacation short and go into full "detective" mode(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Horror of Party Beach</title>
    <desc lang="en">Stuffed with nearly all the essential ingredients for a '50s drive-in classic -- including rubber monsters, clean-cut biker gangs, countless inane rock &amp; roll numbers, and twistin' teeny-boppers who appear to be about 35 -- this uproariously awful monster flick has secured a fond place in the hearts of bad-movie buffs. The horror of the title comes in the form of numerous scaly creatures whose fishy mouths are filled with a tube-like apparatus that makes them appear stuffed to overflowing with frankfurters. Spawned from both human remains and sea life (thanks to a healthy dose of ocean-dumped radioactive waste), the monsters emerge from the sea to dine on surfers and bikini-clad nymphs during a nearly constant teen beach party. Allen Laurel portrays a completely useless scientist who manages to find a solution to the monster menace only after his maid knocks over a vial of sodium on a specimen of one such creature. Armed with this knowledge, Laurel locates the flooded quarry that serves as the beasts' lair, allowing the military to give the critters what-for with a hail of sodium bombs. Director Del Tenney reportedly helmed several scenes from his sickbed while battling the flu... which probably explains quite a lot. The soundtrack features a plentitude of non-hits performed by surf-rockers The Del-Aires (named after the director?) including the toe-tapper "Zombie Stomp."(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Flesh Eaters</title>
    <desc lang="en">This thoroughly weird but truly inspired monster flick is one of the earliest gore films to splatter across drive-in screens in the years prior to Herschell Gordon Lewis' notorious Blood Trilogy. The plot finds a besotted movie star (Rita Morley) and her entourage trapped on an island surrounded by aquatic flesh-munching amoebas (represented by scratches on the film emulsion) created by mad scientist Peter Bartell (Martin Kosleck). These sparkly little death-blobs make mincemeat of most of the cast, including a dorky beatnik (Ray Tudor) who ingests a few of the little buggers in his drink -- leading to an agonizingly fatal case of indigestion. Good photography and well-designed makeup effects make the most of a shoestring budget. Film editor Radley Metzger found his own way as the director of numerous soft-porn films in the '60s and '70s(n)</desc>

When CIA operative Roger Ferris (DiCaprio) uncovers evidence indicating that a major terrorist leader may be operating out of Jordan, he enlists the aid of CIA veteran Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe) in infiltrating the elusive saboteur's vast underground network. During the course of his dangerous mission, Ferris gradually comes to question how much he can trust his presumed allies -- who include not just Hoffman, but the outwardly helpful head of Jordanian intelligence as well(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Terminator 2: Judgment Day</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director James Cameron and lead actors Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton return for part two of the sci-fi franchise. The film is set 11 years after Sarah Connor's first, all-too-close brush with death at the hands of an android assassin. She's incarcerated in a mental health institution for her insistent, passionately held belief that mankind is on the verge of extinction instigated by the soon-to-go-rogue Skynet automated US defence network. Meanwhile, her young son, John Connor, is living with his grandparents. Having failed at the first attempt to eradicate its future nemesis, Skynet sends another deadly envoy, a shape-shifting T-1000 Terminator, back in time to the present to murder John. But the future John Connor has counteracted the Skynet mission by reprogramming a T-800 Terminator to protect his young self. Unfortunately, Sarah's last encounter with the T-800 was a far from happy experience, so she's not going to react well to seeing it again; and she's blissfully unaware of the real threat to her son. Can she once again save John's life, and the future of humanity? Head-spinning time travel complications aside, Cameron and the cast deliver another much-praised, thoughtful and thrilling ride, which earned one of its four Oscars for its superb special effects(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Inspired by the chilling real-life cast of Thomas Montgomery, this made-for-television drama from producer/director Courteney Cox serves as a cautionary tale about trusting strangers on the internet. Montgomery was a family man fast-approaching 50 when he began chatting with an online stranger who claimed to be a gorgeous teenage girl.

Dr Theodor Morell's records, which have been locked away since 1945, are a unique source of information. They reveal that, far from being a picture of robust health, the Fuehrer was a nervy hypochondriac, and chart in great detail his descent into illness and drug dependency.(n)</desc>

Dr Theodor Morell's records, which have been locked away since 1945, are a unique source of information. They reveal that, far from being a picture of robust health, the Fuehrer was a nervy hypochondriac, and chart in great detail his descent into illness and drug dependency.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Winged Seduction: Birds of Paradise</title>
    <desc lang="en">National Geographic photographer Tim Laman and ornithologist Ed Scholes have spent the better part of a decade sleeping in tents and dangling from the rain forest canopy to document all 39 species of Birds of Paradise. Their mission takes them into the jungles of one of last wild places on earth, New Guinea - where children carry machetes, women carry heavy loads and men carry on tribal warfare. Far-flung islands, impenetrable jungle and extreme elevations all create areas of isolation where ordinary birds have evolved into some of the most beautifully bizarre species on earth. Tim and Ed's first quarry on this expedition is Goldie's Bird of Paradise - a dazzling color-shaker that attracts females with a mating dance done in pairs. Rough seas, a flooded island and inaccurate scouting all stand in their way, but Tim and Ed make natural history filmmaking history by capturing a Goldie display with a remote controlled camouflaged camera. After a wild flight into the Huon Mountains, they search out Wahne's Parotia, a shape-shifter that transforms from bird to a feathered man in a skirt. Tim and Ed are after a scientific first - filming the Parotia from the female's perspective. Feathers that look like a skirt from the side, look like an oval from above, where the female audience members sit - no human has ever filmed it before. Digital explorers on an old-fashioned quest, Tim and Ed have survived everything the jungle has to throw at them to become first in the world to capture all 39 species of Birds of Paradise(n)</desc>

The 12 matchplay contests always produce a wealth of drama and quality golf, although Europe eased to a relatively comfortable victory last time out at Gleneagles, turning a 10-6 overnight advantage into a 16.5-11.5 triumph. This time the Americans started as favourites, with half of the European team never having experienced Ryder Cup golf before, adding extra responsibility to the likes of Rory McIlroy, Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Traffic</title>
    <desc lang="en">Described by director Steven Soderbergh as "Nashville meets The French Connection," this multi-character drama explores the effects of international drug trafficking on all fronts: from their source, to the U.S. border, to the federal government, to the private lives of users. Based upon a miniseries originally aired on Britain's Channel 4, Traffic divides its time among three main storylines and almost a dozen locales. The first and primary plot thread, set in Ohio and Washington, D.C., concerns freshly-appointed drug czar Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas), whose enthusiasm for his new prestige position is quickly offset when he realizes his 16-year-old daughter Caroline (Erika Christensen) is graduating from recreational drug use to habitual abuse -- a secret that his wife, Barbara (Amy Irving), has kept from him. South of the border, Mexican cop Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro) attempts to wage his own war on drugs, heading off a cocaine shipment in the middle of the desert with his less-than-virtuous partner Manolo Sanchez (Jacob Vargas). Surrounded by corruption, Javier approaches the drug war with an attitude of patience and compromise, which opens him up to investigation from General Arturo Salazar (Tomas Milian), the country's dubious drug-enforcement liaison to the U.S. Meanwhile, San Diego drug kingpin Carlos Alaya (Steven Bauer) is caught in a sting operation spearheaded by DEA agents Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Luis Guzman), leaving behind his very pregnant and very oblivious wife, Helena (Catharine Zeta-Jones). At the behest of Carlos' lawyer and shady confidante, Arnie Metzger (Dennis Quaid), Helena decides to carry on the family business -- with tragic consequences. Adapted by Rules of Engagement scribe Stephen Gaghan, Traffic marked Soderbergh's second major release in 2000 after the critical and box-office success of Erin Brockovich, as well as his second feature as cinematographer (credited under the pseudonym Peter Andrews). A favorite with various guild and critics' awards, Traffic won four Academy Awards in 2001, including statues for Best Supporting Actor (Del Toro) and Best Adapted Screenplay (Gaghan), and surprise wins for Steven Mirrone's editing and Soderbergh's direction(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Hills Have Eyes</title>
    <desc lang="en">Horror auteur Wes Craven followed his threadbare but horrifically compelling cult classic Last House on the Left with this wonderfully demented morality fable about a bloody war of attrition between two extremely different families. The story opens on the journey of the Carters, a mildly dysfunctional extended family led by patriarch "Big Bob" Carter (Russ Grieve), as they travel across the California desert in search of an inherited silver mine. When a broken axle leaves them stranded in the middle of a former nuclear testing site, their attempts to find help lead them unwittingly into the territory of a savage family of cave-dwelling cannibals, the apparent progeny of the bearlike Jupiter (James Whitworth) and an abducted prostitute. Jupiter's eldest son Pluto (professional movie weirdo Michael Berryman) leads the first brutal attack on the defenseless Carters who, through necessity, are driven to equally extreme measures in order to survive. Though the film is not overtly bloody, the scenes depicting this confrontation are rendered with an unflinching directness, and the violations visited on the Carters are so brutal as to make the survivors' regression into savagery all the more convincing. No one is spared from the nightmare: Jupiter's boys have even kidnapped the youngest member of the Carter family -- a mere infant -- to serve as fodder for their next barbecue, and the baby becomes the main point of contention between the rival clans. Craven nevertheless refuses to take the easy way out by depicting his "monsters" as soullessly evil; parallels between either family's "values" are clearly drawn as the differences between the two clans begin to blur(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Royal Tenenbaums</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Wes Anderson and his longtime friend and writing partner Owen Wilson follow up Bottle Rocket (1996) and Rushmore (1998) with this similarly offbeat comedy about a dysfunctional family reunion. Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) was a successful attorney who had three children with his wife Etheline (Anjelica Huston), an archaeologist. Each of the Tenenbaum kids was a precocious genius: Chas (Ben Stiller) made a killing as a child investor. Richie (Luke Wilson) was a junior tennis champ and three-time U.S. Nationals winner. The adopted Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) was a playwright who won a 50,000-dollar Braverman Grant in the ninth grade. When Royal abruptly left his family, however, it was the beginning of two decades of betrayal and failure that would scar the Tenenbaums for life. Their past resentments are bitterly held against Royal when he suddenly reappears, claiming to have six weeks to live and a desire to reconnect with his family. Typically, Royal's story is a sham, but his presence and sincere desire for absolution soon have a profound effect on the Tenenbaums, who are each dealing with thwarted desires and relationships. Among them are Richie's lifelong love for Margot, who's unhappily married to Raleigh St.Clair (Bill Murray) and Etheline's eccentric engagement to Henry Sherman (Danny Glover), who wishes to marry her. The Royal Tenenbaums also co-stars Owen Wilson and features narration provided by Alec Baldwin(n)</desc>

Now Sam and his family (wife Jessica Lange and daughter Juliette Lewis, in an outstanding debut) are about to be terrorized by Max, who is determined that they should "learn something about loss". But the Bowden family are not themselves completely innocent: both women find themselves strangely attracted to the murderer, and Sam himself may have withheld some vital evidence at Cady's trial which could have changed the jury's verdict(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A young couple (Alexie Gilmore, Bryce Johnson) venture into Six Rivers National Forest in Northern California to search for Bigfoot, and make a terrifying discovery in this found-footage horror film from writer-director Bobcat Goldthwait. Convinced that he will capture video evidence of Sasquatch at the same place where the legendary Patterson-Gimlin film was shot, Jim (Bryce Johnson) persuades his skeptical girlfriend Kelly (Alexie Gilmore) to join him on a cryptozoological excursion into the deep woods. Before Jim and Kelly set out on their mission, however, they first visit Willow Creek -- a town that thrives on the Bigfoot phenomenon -- to interview the locals about the legend. There, the couple are repeatedly warned that the forest can be a dangerous place at night -- warnings that go unheeded by Jim as he single-mindedly focuses on making the journey he's dreamt about for years. Later, in the darkened woods, however, the once-carefree couple experience paralyzing fear when someone -- or something -- begins rooting around their campsite, and uttering inhuman howls. Uncertain if they've actually survived an encounter with Bigfoot or simply fallen victim to a cruel prank by the locals, Jim and Kelly agree to pack their bags, and return to civilization at sunrise. But this is just the beginning of a nightmare that neither of them may ever awaken from(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Ice Storm</title>
    <desc lang="en">Ang Lee's haunting drama won the Best Screenplay award in Cannes and was a hit with the critics for its powerful evocation of the listless decadence that characterised the closing years of the '70s. Starring Kevin Kline and Sigourney Weaver, the film is set against the backdrop of a small Connecticut town shrouded in winter in the dark days of Watergate. The parallel experiences of the adults and children of one family are shown as they experiment with sex and drugs in an increasingly desperate attempt to create meaning in their shallow, bourgeois lives, unaware that a storm is fast approaching(n)</desc>

Convinced that there's more to life than peeling off skimpy outfits for leering bar patrons, exotic dancer Beth Raymer (Rebecca Hall) opts to try her luck as a cocktail waitress in Las Vegas, and quickly makes the acquaintance of Dink (Bruce Willis) -- a man with a talent for making quick cash on winning sports teams. When Dink hires Beth to place wagers at multiple casinos, they quickly discover she's got a knack for numbers, and form a lucrative partnership. But all good things must come to an end, and when Dink's jealous wife Tulip (Catherine Zeta-Jones) catches wind of the relationship she insists that her husband fire his new good-luck charm immediately. Dejected, Beth takes flight to New York, where her winning streak comes to a sudden end after she goes to work for a shady bookie(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Alan Paton's classic novel about two fathers coming to terms with personal loss and the emotional scars inflicted on South Africa during the era of apartheid was brought to the screen for a second time with this adaptation, the first major film produced in South Africa after Nelson Mandela's election ended mandatory white rule in that nation. Rev. Stephen Kumalo (James Earl Jones) is a minister from a poverty-stricken farming community who travels to Johannesburg for the first time in search of his son Absalom (Eric Miyeni), who moved to the city some time back and has gone missing. Kumalo regards the big city as a den of iniquity, and his low expectations are not betrayed; he is robbed and beaten shortly after he arrives, and when he visits his brother John (Charles S. Dutton), he discovers that Absalom has become a petty thief with a pregnant girlfriend, his sister Gertrude (Dambisa Kente) is a prostitute, and John has renounced his faith in God and advocates the violent overthrow of South Africa's white leadership. James Jarvis (Richard Harris) -- a wealthy white landowner from the same part of the country as Kumalo -- has also arrived in Johannesburg, also with sad personal business to attend to; his son, a well-liked activist for the rights of the city's black majority population, was killed during a robbery(n)</desc>

Dolittle and his pushy partner Mark Weller hope to strike a lucrative deal with a major corporation, but more and more of Dolittle's time is taken up giving CPR to lab rats and talking down a suicidal tiger from jumping five storeys. The film works because Murphy's character is played relatively straight while the creatures are allowed to be cynically sarcastic about him, humans and others species. Special plaudits go to the lab rats voiced by Reni Santoni and John Leguizamo, Chris Rock as Rocky the guinea pig and Norm Macdonald as Dolittle's laconic companion Lucky the dog(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Dr. Dolittle</title>
    <desc lang="en">Betty Thomas's remake of the 1967 film is neatly updated with Eddie Murphy playing Dr John Dolittle, who talks to the animals. Dolittle and his pushy partner Mark Weller hope to strike a lucrative deal with a major corporation, but more and more of Dolittle's time is taken up giving CPR to lab rats and talking down a suicidal tiger from jumping five storeys. The film works because Murphy's character is played relatively straight while the creatures are allowed to be cynically sarcastic about him, humans and others species. Special plaudits go to the lab rats voiced by Reni Santoni and John Leguizamo, Chris Rock as Rocky the guinea pig and Norm Macdonald as Dolittle's laconic companion Lucky the dog(n)</desc>

Determined that no child shall be enslaved by the brutal Lord's Resistance Army, Childers turns to God for inspiration, and establishes an orphanage for wounded kids and child soldiers. When the Lord's Resistance Army refuses to stand down, Childers organizes a militia to protect the children.

    <title lang="en">Smoke</title>
    <desc lang="en">This ensemble drama centers on a neighborhood cigar store as it chronicles the entangled lives of fifteen characters. The story is divided into five chapters each bearing the name of a different character. The main players have roles in all five stories. The first, "Paul" follows recently widowed novelist Paul Benjamin whose wife died during a bank robbery. He is almost hit by a truck when a black teenager who calls himself Rashid, saves him. The thankful novelist lets the teen stay with him for a while. Rashid's story forms the basis of chapter two. Paul is visited by Rashid's aunt who tells him that the boys true name is Thomas Cole. He has recently learned that his dad is really alive and living out of the city. Rashid journeys to meet his dad, Cyrus Cole. When he meets him, Rashid tells him his name is Paul Benjamin. Auggie, the cigar store manager, also gets a surprise when his ex-wife shows up to tell him his daughter is a pregnant drug addict. Rashid tells Paul that he has $6000, the spoils of a recent bank robbery perpetrated by his pal, Creeper. The rest of the chapters are equally convoluted(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Gabrielle Union, Morris Chestnut, Queen Latifah, and Terrence Howard star in a film concerning a young girl who implores a department-store Santa to find a new husband for her divorced mother for Christmas. Single mother of three Nancy (Union) has been putting the needs of her three children ahead of her own for as far back as she can remember, and lately her youngest daughter, Emily (Khail Bryant), has become acutely aware of her mother's palpable sadness. As Christmas draws near, Nancy takes her kids to the mall for a cheerful visit with jolly old Saint Nick. When it comes time for Emily's turn to sit on Santa's lap and make her Christmas wish, she selflessly remembers her mother's recent comment that a compliment from a man would be the best gift of all. Determined to make her mother happy again even if it means sacrificing her own wish, Emily relays the message to Santa (Chestnut), not realizing that the man beneath the beard is actually an office-supply salesman and ambitious singer/songwriter named Benjamin. Recognizing the daughter's love for her mother and sensing something truly special in Nancy, Benjamin cheerfully obliges the young girl, setting into motion a series of events that promise to make this the most memorable holiday in quite some time.

The year is 1969, and despite the fact that the Vietnam War is raging halfway across the globe, all is ominously quiet on the back roads of America. Eighteen-year-old Dean Hill (Taylor Handley) has just received his draft notice, and his older brother, Eric (Matthew Bomer), is determined to watch out for his younger sibling by ensuring that Dean enroll in the Marine Corps rather than risking his luck at the local induction center. Dean has other plans, though, and as soon as the pair and their girlfriends, Bailey (Diora Baird) and Chrissie (Jordana Brewster), return from their final fling in sunny Texas, he plans to confront his brother with the prospect of dodging the draft. When an unsettling encounter with malevolent bikers Holden (Lee Tergesen) and Alex (Cyia Batten) results in a serious car accident in which Chrissie is thrown from the vehicle, the arrival of Sheriff Hoyt (R. Lee Ermey) at first appears to be a moment of divine intervention. However, when Sheriff Hoyt murders thieving Alex in cold blood and then shepherds her friends into the back of his police cruiser as Chrissie watches from the brush, their momentary reprieve soon gives way to an unimaginable terror. As Hoyt transports her ailing friends to the Hewitt home, where a childlike man named Thomas is currently undergoing the transformation into cannibalistic madman Leatherface (Andrew Bryniarski), a desperate Chrissie attempts to enlist the aid of Holden in rescuing her friends from a fate worse than death(n)</desc>

This is all well and good, except for one detail: the town is utterly devoid of people. The explanation is more "logical" than one might expect from a Twilight Zone episode, but that may be because this was the pilot show, and the producers wanted to "sell" the property to sponsors who might otherwise be skeptical about a weekly sci-fi/fantasy anthology. Scripted by series creator Rod Serling and filmed on the familiar Universal backlot, "Where Is Everybody?" was telecast as the Twilight Zone debut episode on October 3, 1959(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Switch</title>
    <desc lang="en">A woman approaching middle age yet still childless decides to get pregnant by artificial insemination, only to discover that the donor she chose may not be the father of her child in this comedy starring Jennifer Aniston and Jason Bateman. Wally Mars (Bateman) is a dyed-in-the-wool pessimist. Hopelessly neurotic and unrepentantly narcissistic, he gets no joy out of life except for the time he spends with his best friend Kassie (Jennifer Aniston). However, despite the fact that Wally pines to be more than just friends with Kassie, she isn't convinced they'd make a good couple. When Kassie announces to Wally that she's found the perfect sperm donor, he's crestfallen; as far as he's concerned, the ideal candidate is standing right in front of her. Later, Kassie selects handsome stranger Roland (Patrick Wilson) to provide the seed. Things get complicated when Kassie's best friend Debbie (Juliette Lewis) throws an "insemination party" to commemorate the big event, and Wally intercepts Roland's special delivery, drunkenly replacing it with his own before blacking out. Pregnant and content, Kassie leaves the city for Minnesota, where she gives birth to a healthy baby boy. Flash-forward seven years, and Kassie returns to New York with her son, Sebastian (Thomas Robinson), who shares an uncanny number of physical and psychological traits with embittered bachelor Wally. Before long Wally and Sebastian have become good friends, and Wally becomes convinced that the boy is his biological son. His ideal family is finally within reach, and if he can just figure out a means of breaking the news to Kassie gently, perhaps she'll find it in her heart to forgive him, and recognize that he'll make the perfect father for Sebastian(n)</desc>

They manage to crash the event of the year, a weekend-long celebration for the wedding of the daughter of William Cleary, Secretary of the Treasury and a possible candidate for the Presidency. But John makes the mistake of falling for the bride's sister Claire Cleary, while Jeremy has to fight off her clingy sister Gloria.
