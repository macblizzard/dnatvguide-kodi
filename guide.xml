    <title lang="en">Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins</title>
    <desc lang="en">A single father who has just found success as the host of an outrageous television talk show begins to question his path in life when he returns home to attend his parents' 50th wedding anniversary party in the company of his famous fiancée -- a reality television star -- in this crisis-of-conscience comedy starring Martin Lawrence. RJ Stevens (Lawrence) is a television talk-show sensation who has transcended his modest Southern beginnings to become the most popular self-help guru ever to grace the small screen. His show, "Team of Me," is a ratings juggernaut, his fiancée is a beautiful reality television star, and his pockets are always lined with large bills. There are few Tinseltown dreams that RJ hasn't already achieved, so when his parents announce their 50th wedding anniversary, the family-oriented television star immediately drops everything and sets his sights on Georgia. As a boy, RJ was always the target of ridicule within his family, but these days things are different; not only does RJ have a ten-year-old son, but his bride-to-be is admired by countless viewers all across the globe on a weekly basis. But RJ's egotistical West Coast attitude simply doesn't fly in the South, and when his lovable but relentless family refuses to cut him any slack due to his current superstar status, he must finally pause and take stock of the man he has become. Louis C.K., Cedric the Entertainer, Michael Clarke Duncan, and James Earl Jones co-star in a Southern-flavored family comedy written and directed by Malcolm D. Lee(n)</desc>

Concerned that her husband Richard (Edward Herrmann) has become disturbingly aloof and argumentative at home, Emily (Kelly Bishop) tries to cheer him up by organizing the society debut of their granddaughter Rory (Alexis Bledel). Unfortunately, tradition demands that Rory be "presented" by her father Christopher (David Sutcliffe) -- who of course ran out on the girl and her unwed mother, Lorelai (Lauren Graham), years earlier. When asked to escort Rory, the customarily dishevelled and unreliable Christopher not only accepts the invitation but also arrives in a clean new suit announcing that he has taken a good, respectable job. As it turns out, these are not the only surprises that Christopher has in store for Lorelai and her family -- nor is Richard any slouch in the "surprise" department himself(n)</desc>

Concerned that her husband Richard (Edward Herrmann) has become disturbingly aloof and argumentative at home, Emily (Kelly Bishop) tries to cheer him up by organizing the society debut of their granddaughter Rory (Alexis Bledel). Unfortunately, tradition demands that Rory be "presented" by her father Christopher (David Sutcliffe) -- who of course ran out on the girl and her unwed mother, Lorelai (Lauren Graham), years earlier. When asked to escort Rory, the customarily dishevelled and unreliable Christopher not only accepts the invitation but also arrives in a clean new suit announcing that he has taken a good, respectable job. As it turns out, these are not the only surprises that Christopher has in store for Lorelai and her family -- nor is Richard any slouch in the "surprise" department himself(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Who Wants to Be a Millionaire</title>
    <desc lang="en">Although the once-hot game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? had lost its luster as a prime-time ABC offering, the producers felt that there was enough life left in the property to warrant a Monday-through-Friday syndicated version. Taking over from the earlier series' host Regis Philbin was Meredith Vieira of The View. To make certain that the series would not be bankrupted after its first week on the air, the questions posed to contestants were considerably harder than those on the prime-time incarnation. Also, the famous "fastest finger" round was eliminated, taking some of the pressure off the contestants when they struggled to come up with answers. The most noteworthy change from the original version was the absence of Regis Philbin's familiar catchphrases: One would never hear Meredith Vieira chime in with the legendary "Is that your final answer?" The syndicated Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? was launched on September 16, 2002(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The extraordinary story of a strange cult that came to light in 2013, when three women emerged from a small flat in Brixton, south London, after decades in captivity. The documentary traces the group back to its roots in the 1970s, when Aravindan Balakrishnan, who believed in an international communist revolution, created a tiny political sect that followed the teachings of China's Chairman Mao. However, his left-wing collective evolved into a pseudo-religious cult, in which members were controlled, threatened and brainwashed so that they were too terrified to leave.(n)</desc>

He also rustles up his own version of lamb biryani with a Bombay mix crust, creates giant poppadoms measuring almost a metre wide, and serves a new type of lager - `beeryani', infused with rice and pandan leaves. As a final nod to the British curry house experience, the chef makes a giant After Eight-inspired dessert, and dishes up his unique menu in a pop-up restaurant on the outskirts of Bradford.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Cabin Boy</title>
    <desc lang="en">Chris Elliot lends his flat and charmless presence to Adam Resnick's equally flat and charmless Cabin Boy. Elliot plays Nathaniel Mayweather, a simpering, upper-class snob who has just graduated from the Stephenson Finishing School. At the school he has completed all the course work to become an official "fancy lad." He heads after graduation to set sail and take over the charge of his father's hotel in Hawaii. But instead of getting on the luxury liner Queen Catherine, he boards a stinking fishing scow, "The Filthy Whore." The dirty and surly crew refuses to take Nathaniel to Hawaii, so Nathaniel takes matters into his own hands and tries to change the course of the ship. That he does, but instead of Hawaii, he sends the vessel into a bizarre section of the ocean called "Hell's Bucket" --a Ray Harryhausen nightmare spot with walking icebergs, talking cupcakes, laughing clouds, six-armed-women, and giant hardware-store managers. Through all this, Nathaniel develops a romance with a long-distance swimmer, Trina (Melora Walters), that the fishing tug has snagged. The beatific romance comes to a head one night as Nathaniel and Trina stare into the star-lit sky. Trina bares her soul to Nathaniel, after which, Nathaniel responds, "Sorry. I was just thinking how much fun it is to roast pumpkin seeds."(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Dead Woman Walking: The Karla Faye Tucker Story. This documentary, part of the American Justice series from A&amp;E, examines the Texas death penalty case of Karla Faye Walker. Narrated by American Justice host and producer Bill Kurtis, this episode goes inside the investigation of the two murders that Walker and her boyfriend Daniel Ryan Garrett committed. The trial of Walker is shown through exclusive footage. After the conviction, American Justice follows her through her daily life, showing her prison surroundings and talking with her about her crimes. Sentenced to death, while Walker was waiting to be executed, she became a born-again Christian. Her lawyers used this transformation as leverage to try to get her death sentence reduced to life in prison. Their attempts were unsuccessful and Walker was killed by lethal injection in February 1998. American Justice also shows interviews with lawyers and law enforcement professionals who knew Walker(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Dead Woman Walking: The Karla Faye Tucker Story</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Dead Woman Walking: The Karla Faye Tucker Story. This documentary, part of the American Justice series from A&amp;E, examines the Texas death penalty case of Karla Faye Walker. Narrated by American Justice host and producer Bill Kurtis, this episode goes inside the investigation of the two murders that Walker and her boyfriend Daniel Ryan Garrett committed. The trial of Walker is shown through exclusive footage. After the conviction, American Justice follows her through her daily life, showing her prison surroundings and talking with her about her crimes. Sentenced to death, while Walker was waiting to be executed, she became a born-again Christian. Her lawyers used this transformation as leverage to try to get her death sentence reduced to life in prison. Their attempts were unsuccessful and Walker was killed by lethal injection in February 1998. American Justice also shows interviews with lawyers and law enforcement professionals who knew Walker(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Family differences and personal grudges add drama to an already tense situation as the lives of a team of mountain climbers hang in the balance in this action drama. Peter Garrett (Chris O'Donnell) and his sister Annie (Robin Tunney) are the children of Royce Garrett (Stuart Wilson), an avid outdoorsman and climbing enthusiast who died when an accident left all three hanging from a single rope; Royce ordered Peter to cut him loose to save the lives of his kids, even though he knew it would mean his death. Years later, Peter has given up climbing and become a respected nature photographer, while Annie, who holds Peter responsible for her father's death, is a famous world-class mountain climber who is hired by Elliot Vaughn (Bill Paxton), a self-made billionaire, to help him scale K2, a mountain in the Himalayas that's the second-highest peak in the world. In the midst of the climb, dangerous weather strikes, and Elliot, Annie, and their crew find themselves trapped in a cavern that's been sealed tight by an avalanche. Peter, who is near K2 working on an assignment, quickly organizes a crew of expert climbers to save Annie and the other mountaineers, who must work under a tight deadline before the trapped climbers run out of air. Peter's partners in the rescue include beautiful medic Monique (Izabella Scorupco), radical climbers Cyril (Steve Le Marquand) and Malcolm (Ben Mendelsohn), disciplined Pakistani crewman Kareem (Alexander Siddig), and Montgomery (Scott Glenn), an eccentric outdoorsman who has a score to settle with Elliot. While backgrounds were shot on location in Pakistan, most of the climbing sequences in Vertical Limit were actually filmed on mountain ranges in New Zealand(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This comedy is quite a change for Hong Kong martial arts hero Jet Li. Li plays Chow, the writer of a pulp-style adventure serial, who seems to be failing in both his career and his marriage to Monica (Rosamund Kwan). The film also enacts out Chow's story as he writes it: Li also plays the fictional Dr. Wai, a daring adventurer in the tradition of Doc Savage or Indiana Jones. As Chow tries to churn out his story, Dr. Wai pursues a mysterious scroll called "The Scripture Without Words"; the film's transitions between reality and fantasy is reminiscent of films such as Brazil and The Princess Bride(n)</desc>

Lisa Simpson (voice of Yeardley Smith) develops a bad cold and has to stay home from school; without much to do, her mother Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) wheels a television and a videogame setup into her room which to her brother Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright). While Lisa is resistant to the game at first, she becomes a master of "Dash Dingo," and by the time she returns to school, for once in her life she's behind on her homework and unprepared for a test. Lisa postpones the test by pretending to fall ill again, and Bart offers to help her by introducing her to his friend Nelson (also voiced by Cartwright), who can provide her the answers for the test -- for a price. Against her better judgment, Lisa buys the answers and ends up getting an A+ on the test. While this isn't anything new for Springfield's youngest intellectual, Lisa is a bit embarrassed by the fuss over her grade, especially when it kicks Springfield Elementary's grade average into a higher category, making the school eligible for increased funding. Lisa is torn -- should the school profit from her ethical lapse, or should she tell the truth? Meanwhile, Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) has a taste for shellfish, and buys a small lobster in order to fatten him up for a proper feast. However, once Homer names the crustacean "Mr. Pinchy," he no longer has the heart to eat it, and makes the lobster into his pet. "Lisa Gets An 'A'" first aired on November 22, 1998(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Dead Poets Society</title>
    <desc lang="en">Robin Williams toned down his usually manic comic approach in this successful period drama. In 1959, the Welton Academy is a staid but well-respected prep school where education is a pragmatic and rather dull affair. Several of the students, however, have their thoughts on the learning process (and life itself) changed when a new teacher comes to the school. John Keating (Williams) is an unconventional educator who tears chapters of his textbooks and asks his students to stand on their desks to see the world from a new angle. Keating introduces his students to poetry, and his free-thinking attitude and the liberating philosophies of the authors he introduces to his class have a profound effect on his students, especially Todd (Ethan Hawke), who would like to be a writer; Neil ( Robert Sean Leonard), who dreams of being an actor, despite the objections of his father; Knox (Josh Charles), a hopeless romantic; Steven (Allelon Ruggiero), an intellectual who learns to use his heart as well as his head; Charlie (Gale Hansen), who begins to lose his blasé attitude; unconventional Gerard (James Waterston); and practical Richard (Dylan Kussman). Keating urges his students to seize the day and live their lives boldly; but when this philosophy leads to an unexpected tragedy, headmaster Mr. Nolan (Norman Lloyd) fires Keating, and his students leap to his defense. Dead Poets Society was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Williams; it won one, for Tom Schulman's original screenplay(n)</desc>

Undaunted, she recruits a South Philly working girl (Poehler) to act as her surrogate. Everything goes according to plan until a pregnant Poehler shows up on Fey's doorstep with no place to live, and suddenly two very different women are joined together to create a very unexpected family(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Dead Poets Society</title>
    <desc lang="en">Robin Williams toned down his usually manic comic approach in this successful period drama. In 1959, the Welton Academy is a staid but well-respected prep school where education is a pragmatic and rather dull affair. Several of the students, however, have their thoughts on the learning process (and life itself) changed when a new teacher comes to the school. John Keating (Williams) is an unconventional educator who tears chapters of his textbooks and asks his students to stand on their desks to see the world from a new angle. Keating introduces his students to poetry, and his free-thinking attitude and the liberating philosophies of the authors he introduces to his class have a profound effect on his students, especially Todd (Ethan Hawke), who would like to be a writer; Neil ( Robert Sean Leonard), who dreams of being an actor, despite the objections of his father; Knox (Josh Charles), a hopeless romantic; Steven (Allelon Ruggiero), an intellectual who learns to use his heart as well as his head; Charlie (Gale Hansen), who begins to lose his blasé attitude; unconventional Gerard (James Waterston); and practical Richard (Dylan Kussman). Keating urges his students to seize the day and live their lives boldly; but when this philosophy leads to an unexpected tragedy, headmaster Mr. Nolan (Norman Lloyd) fires Keating, and his students leap to his defense. Dead Poets Society was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Williams; it won one, for Tom Schulman's original screenplay(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Carol Fuchs adapts writer/director Sandra Nettelbeck's screenplay for the 2001 romantic drama Mostly Martha for this Scott Hicks directed remake starring Catherine Zeta-Jones, Aaron Eckhart, and Patricia Clarkson. Kate Armstrong (Jones) is the master chef who is equally intense both in and out of the kitchen. Though Kate's "Type A" personality serves her well when whipping up meals in the trendy Manhattan eatery where she has made a name for herself, it threatens to sink her when she is named as the guardian of her nine-year-old niece Zoe (Little Miss Sunshine's Abigail Breslin). To complicate matters, an impetuous new sous chef named Nick Palmer (Eckhart) has recently joined the kitchen staff and his freewheeling personality seems to stand in direct opposition to Kate's unwavering perfectionism. Yet, despite the fact that they couldn't be more different on the surface, there's no denying the strong attraction between Kate and Nick. As the rivalry between the competitive cooks gradually gives way to romance, the lessons learned by compromising in the kitchen reveal to Kate the importance of learning to openly express herself in order to truly connect with Zoe and find romance with the good-natured Nick(n)</desc>

The always winning and wry Fey portrays a focused and driven New York career woman who desperately wants a baby but is physically unable to carry the child herself.

    <desc lang="en">Adapted from author Gail Carson Levine's award-winning children's book of the same name, the Miramax-financed modern fantasy Ella Enchanted is directed by Tommy O'Haver and stars The Princess Diaries alumna Anne Hathaway. Ella (Hathaway) lives in a magical world in which each child, at the moment of their birth, is given a virtuous "gift" from a fairy godmother. Ella's so-called gift, however, is obedience. This birthright proves itself to be quite the curse once Ella finds herself in the hands of several unscrupulous characters whom she quite literally cannot disobey. Determined to gain control of her life and decisions, Ella sets off on a journey she hopes will end with the lifting of the curse in question. The path, however, isn't easy -- Ella must outwit a slew of unpleasant magical creatures ranging from ogres to talking books with evil plots. Though perilous, Ella's adventures turn out to be necessary obstacles in the path toward finding herself, and maybe even true love along the way. Ella Enchanted also features Cary Elwes, who has starred in a fantasy feature himself (the widely acclaimed The Princess Bride), Hugh Dancy, and Patrick Bergin, among others(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Lantana</title>
    <desc lang="en">The intertwined lives of four couples living in and around Sydney, Australia, form the structure for this drama masquerading as a whodunit. Andrew Bovell freely adapted his play, +Speaking in Tongues, opening up the action, as the geography and topography of Sydney and its suburbs become major characters as well. The film opens with a shot of what looks like a corpse entangled in a thick stand of branches -- the title plant, which grows in profusion in Australia. Bovell and director Ray Lawrence take their time in explaining whose body that is and then slowly reveal, with no help from a number of red herrings, how it happened to be there. The principal players are Valerie Somers (Barbara Hershey), a psychiatrist with issues over her child, a murder victim; her husband, John Knox (Geoffrey Rush), an aloof professor whom she suspects of infidelity; Leon Zat (Anthony LaPaglia), a police detective cheating on his wife, Sonja (Kerry Armstrong), who is a patient of Valerie's. Zat's mistress, Jane O'May (Rachael Blake), is someone he met at a dancing class his wife dragged him to; she is estranged from her husband, Pete (Glenn L. Robbins). Their neighbors, Paula (Daniela Farinacci) and Nik D'Amato (Vince Colosimo), try to stay neutral in the O'Mays' split; she works days as a nurse and he's unemployed and minds their children. Suspicion around the disappearance of one character manages to enmesh all of the others. Bovell's stories are about secrets, real and imagined, and how they can poison relationships. The film virtually swept all the major awards at the Australian Film Institute's annual ceremony, though its reception in the States was mildly respectful(n)</desc>

He has abandoned his feisty wife Bobbi (Daryl Hannah) and young daughter to set off on a nine-month road odyssey with his manager Lester Irving (Garrett Morris), in an effort to collect cash at local karaoke gigs. Lester grooms Sunny by choosing what songs he will do, keeping up with what the judges are like, and negotiating with competitors like Sammy Bones (Mac Davis), another traveling hopeful. On his road journey, he encounters several women, including Janice (Peggy Lipton), a club waitress, and Cheryl (Crystal Bernard), whom he takes home after she has an accident in a restroom, only to find himself being enticed by her underage daughter Tangerine (Camellia Clouse). The road trip comes to a stop, however, when Sunny is pulled over by police who claim that his vehicle is stolen and that Bobbi has reported it. Sunny then seeks refuge with brother Tracy (Anthony Edwards) while he decides his next move. Jackpot is the first released film to be shot with the 24P HDTV camera, which was then blown up to Cinemascope 35 mm format(n)</desc>

Anderson original by serving as a straight-up sci-fi horror scarefest. The aliens (and a predator) have landed on planet Earth, and small-town America is about to become the scene of an epic interstellar showdown. As these two breeds of cosmic killers clash in the small-town streets Gunnison, CO, the locals are sent running for their lives. From the murky sewers to the rain-soaked streets, Gunnison has become a total bloodbath. Nowhere is safe, especially from the unstoppable new hybrid known as the "predalien." Now, as the once-quiet community of Gunnison is overrun by Aliens, the only hope for humankind is a fierce hunter from the deepest reaches of space. But this predator is far from a benevolent savior of the human race, because he'll kill any man, woman, or child who gets in the way of his mission to destroy every last alien under these stormy Colorado skies(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Viggo Mortensen, Naomi Watts, Armin Mueller-Stahl, and Vincent Cassel star in this David Cronenberg's thriller concerning a London midwife who unwittingly stumbles into a clandestine Russian sex trafficking ring. An unidentified Russian teen has been rushed to a London hospital after going into labor. Though midwife Anna Khitrova (Watts) does manage to deliver a healthy baby girl, the newborn's mother dies tragically during delivery. But the deceased mother's secrets did not die with her, because she has left behind a diary. Determined to ensure the newborn is placed with her rightful family, Anna attempts to read the diary and discovers a business card for a local restaurant therein. Upon visiting the restaurant Anna is greeted by kindly owner Semyon (Mueller-Stahl), who generously offers to translate it for her. But Semyon is not what he appears to be, and before long Anna begins to fear that the child could be in great danger. Semyon admits to Anna that the diary contains information about his son Kirill (Cassell) that could land the volatile offspring in jail despite the fact that Kirill is at heart a good person. As the truth begins to unfold and Anna begins to believe that Kirill and his driver Nikolai (Mortensen) - an ambitious driver seeking to ascent the ranks of the notorious Russian mafia - mean the baby harm, an underworld storm begins to brew that could consume all involved(n)</desc>

Jesse Stone is a transplanted L.A. cop who thrived on big city adrenaline, but ultimately buckled under the pressure. Exiled to Paradise after suffering though a nasty divorce and being busted for drinking on the job, Stone now leads a quiet life of writing parking tickets and trying to suppress the urge to cut loose with the booze and babes. When one of his officers out on maternity leave and the other recovering from a recent gunshot wound, Stone turns to some old cold cases to keep himself occupied. Twelve years ago, a local bank teller was killed in broad daylight. Though the gunman responsible for the crime was never brought to justice, Stone soon uncovers a crucial piece of evidence that went overlooked during the original investigation. Now, as this once-cold case gradually begins to heat up again, Stone continues his investigation into an alleged rape that tool place aboard a yacht during Race Week(n)</desc>

She was in the deadly jaws of a massive Great White shark. With deep gashes to her face and her arm almost completely severed, her friends raced to action but will they be able to save her life? Andrew was enjoying a trip to the idyllic Fraser Island with his wife when he was bitten by a snake. Andrew was sure it was a non-venomous snake and wanted to ignore it but his wife insisted they get help. What he didnt know was that the deadly venom of a Brown Snake was cursing through his veins and could very quickly stop his blood from clogging and send his organs into failure ? Young Ryan was playing outdoors when he was bitten by a Jumping Jack Ant. Within seconds, his face began to swell and his airways closed up. His mother and father rushed him to the hospital but didnt recognize the signs of anaphylactic shock(n)</desc>

Zac was excited for a morning surfing with his older brother and mate at a remote surf break in Western Australia. It was a gray, overcast day, but the last thing on the young surfers mind was sharks until one took off his leg in a single bite. In far north Queensland, active Tom went on a pig hunting trip with his two dogs when the roles were reversed and they became the hunted... by a deadly saltwater crocodile. Finally, Duncans idyllic lifestyle living on a boat all changed when he was bitten by what he thought was a harmless mosquito. A simple mosquito bite grew into a large ulcer on his arm, and then spread to multiple sites on his body. It took months before doctors diagnosed the relentless flesh-eating bacteria as the Mycobacterium ulcerans, but by then he was at risk of losing his arm(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Outback Nightmare. Australia is filled with picturesque beaches, parks and rivers but they are not just appealing to the tourists. A late night fishing trip turned into disaster when two mates found themselves stranded on an isolated river when the boat's engine went dead. Rabeh left his friend Sal and decided to venture through the bush to get help. Stumbling in the dark, he fell onto a Redback spiders nest. Within seconds, he became short of breath and paralyzed. Then, Chantal and her brother Simon were on the voyage of a lifetime sailing the remote and beautiful Kimberley Coast with their father. In this part of the country, nothing is forgiving and when the heat bore down on them, they were desperate for a dip in fresh water away from the deadly saltwater crocodiles. But the spot they picked to swim became a deadly playground when Chantal was attacked by a crocodile. Finally, young Jayden went for a swim in remote north Queensland with family friends when he was bitten by the highly venomous stonefish. Within minutes, he was in excruciating pain and needed urgent medical attention but on the way to the mainland the boat got bogged in sand leaving them stranded(n)</desc>

Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) has other body parts on her mind when her latest man sticks his tongue in a previously unexplored orifice and then asks her to do the same for him.

All is going well for the newly reunited Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) and Aidan (John Corbett) until one of their lusty bedroom sessions is rudely interrupted by the voice of Big (Chris Noth) on Carrie's answering machine. Although Aidan proceeds like nothing is wrong, it soon becomes apparent that he's still angry with Carrie over her betrayal. Despite Carrie's attempts to treat him well, Aidan persists in giving her the cold shoulder, and things reach a boiling point when Carrie happens upon him spending a little too much quality time with the waitress at Scout. Charlotte (Kristin Davis) is devoting quality time to becoming a mother and housewife, and shocks her friends with her announcement that she is quitting her job at the gallery. Her announcement creates some tension between her and Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), who Charlotte feels is being particularly judgmental of her decision. Miranda, however, has other worries: while arguing on the phone she pulls her neck out, and subsequently finds herself -- naked, of course -- being rescued by Aidan, who offered to come over when Carrie couldn't. Samantha (Kim Cattrall) wins another round in the battle for gender equality when, after being told by her latest fling that she could stand a bikini waxing, she turns the tables on him and forces him to submit to some very personal grooming(n)</desc>

Each have their different reasons for setting out into the unknown. But having survived volcanoes and hungry hippo attacks, nothing could have prepared them for the greatest danger - a troop of intelligent killer apes who, as one critic wrote, '...make King Kong look like the Jolly Green Giant'. Based on Michael Crichton's bestseller, Marshall's film is great fun, with wonderful cliff-hanging moments and, in Linney's character, one who can out-tough Indiana Jones any day(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Darkness Falls</title>
    <desc lang="en">Children have a very good reason to be afraid of the dark in this flashy horror story. Matilda Dixon was a genially eccentric woman who, in the 1850s, lived in a New England town known as Darkness Falls. Matilda was well known to the local children for her habit of paying them for teeth they'd lost, but when two youngsters mysteriously disappeared, Matilda was lynched by an angry mob wrongly convinced that she had murdered the kids. In the year 2002, former Darkness Falls resident Kyle Walsh (Chaney Kley) lives in Las Vegas and is still desperately afraid of the dark since a childhood run-in with the ghost of Matilda Dixon left him severely traumatized. While police and psychiatrists scoffed at Kyle's stories about Matilda's spirit, his childhood friend Caitlin (Emma Caulfield) is alarmed when her nine-year-old brother Michael (Lee Cormie) begins having nightmares very much like those which disturbed Kyle's rest for years. Like Kyle, Michael has little luck convincing most grown-ups that the white-robed specters he sees in the dark are real, so Caitlin asks Kyle to return to Darkness Falls to help get to the bottom of his story. Darkness Falls marked the directorial debut of filmmaker Jonathan Liebesman(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Bank Job</title>
    <desc lang="en">Jason Statham and Saffron Burrows star in director Roger Donaldson's cinematic account of the true-life 1971 London bank robbery that baffled the authorities and fascinated the public. Terry Leather (Statham) was a small-time car dealer who was trying to leave his shady past behind and start a family. Though he'd never been involved in any major crimes, he wasn't exactly on the straight and narrow his whole life either. Martine Love (Burrows) is a beautiful model from Terry's old neighborhood who knows that her former neighbor is no angel. When Martine proposes a foolproof plan to rob a Baker Street bank, Terry recognizes the danger but realizes this may be the opportunity of a lifetime. As the operation gets underway, the resourceful band of thieves burrows its way into a safe-deposit vault at the Lloyds Bank in Marylebone, quickly hitting a literal treasure trove of cash and priceless gems. But while the crew did know that the safe-deposit boxes contained millions in riches, they didn't realize that they also contained secrets that implicated everyone from London's most notorious underworld gangsters to powerful government figures, and even the Royal Family. Though the crime would make headlines all across Britain for several days after the fact, a government gag order eventually brought all reporting on the case to an immediate halt. Could it be that the most notorious bank robbers in recent memory were actually the most innocent people involved in this scandalous crime?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Powerful drama about a day in the life of a team of predatory real-estate salesmen during the recession of the 1990s, adapted from David Mamet's Pulitzer Prize-winning play. An economic upturn is unlikely, fresh leads are scarce, and the men are driven to increasingly desperate measures to sustain themselves. In this aggressive world, old certainties cannot be relied upon, and friendship is no guarantee of loyalty(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Grey Zone</title>
    <desc lang="en">Actor, writer, and director Tim Blake Nelson adapts this grim look at the holocaust from his own play, based on Miklos Nyiszli's book, Auschwitz: A Doctor's Eyewitness Account. The film centers on the sonderkommando: Jewish concentration camp prisoners whose job was to herd their fellow Jews into the gas chamber, and to dispose of the bodies following the execution. In return, these prisoners received food and a little more time before their own executions. As the members of the sonderkommando struggle to orchestrate what would be the only armed insurrection in Auschwitz, a group of them discover a 14-year-old girl who somehow survived the gas chamber. The girl becomes a symbol for their own spiritual salvation and they become obsessed with keeping the girl alive, even if it endangers the uprising that could save thousands. This film was screened at the 2001 Toronto Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">James Franco directs this adaptation of William Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury, the writer's tale of the Compson family, a once wealthy Southern clan devolving into obscurity. Tim Blake Nelson portrays the patriarch, a boozy lawyer who oversees the lives of his children with cynical monologues delivered through an alcoholic haze. Quentin, the oldest child, goes to Harvard, but he's very close with Caddy, the only daughter in the family who has a child out of wedlock. Second son Jason attempts to rule the family with an iron fist, but he's full of resentment towards Caddy's bastard child. All of them attempt to care for the developmentally disabled Benjy (Franco). Franco employs a fractured approach to the narrative in an attempt to capture Faulkner's distinctive prose style. The Sound and the Fury screened at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Beach</title>
    <desc lang="en">For his first major project after the overwhelming success of Titanic, Leonardo Di Caprio took a risky path in this adaptation of Alex Garland's acclaimed novel, directed by Danny Boyle. Richard (Di Caprio) is an American backpacking through Asia with a handful of friends from Europe. While in Bangkok, he meets a mad Scotsman who calls himself Daffy Duck (Robert Carlyle). Shortly before Mr. Duck kills himself, he gives Richard a crude map to a place in Thailand that he claims is paradise on earth: beautiful, unspoiled, and uninhabited. For lack of anything better to do, Richard and his companions try to locate the spot, which, after a dangerous and taxing journey, takes them to a beach as beautiful as Duck said it would be. Richard and his friends settle in, but before long they discover that they are not alone; a large group of fellow travelers has already dug themselves in, and they have established a community with the same social evils that Richard was hoping to leave behind. Just as important, there is an army of natives who grow marijuana in the nearby hills and do not appreciate the presence of these visitors. The Beach proved controversial during production, partly due to production delays and shifting release dates, partly due to environmental concerns after crew members bulldozed parts of the Thai island of Phi Phi Le for the planting of non-native trees(n)</desc>

When one of Axle's products turns out to be dangerous and causes several thousand customers to lose a finger, he loses his fortune and spends eight years in prison for gross negligence. Back on the street, Axle is broke but determined to find a way back to the top, though he's just a bit more humble than he used to be and wants to win back the love of his daughter, Claire (Camilla Belle), whom he neglected as a child, and his ex-wife (Virginia Madsen). Things go badly for Axle on his first day working at a big-box discount store, and he's left with little alternative than to ask Claire to let him stay with her; she and her roommate, Fibbi (Heather Graham), aren't so sure this is a good idea, but they grudgingly agree and end up helping Axle in his bid to redeem himself.

Wayne and Garth have to battle the executive not only to save their show, but also Cassandra. Director Penelope Spheeris, Myers and Carvey hang a lot of silly, but funny, jokes on this thin plot, and the energy of the cast--as well as the wild pop-culture references--make Wayne's World a cut above the average Saturday Night Live spin-off movie(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Wayne's World</title>
    <desc lang="en">Based on the Saturday Night Live sketch of the same name, Wayne's World is a wacky, irreverent pop-culture comedy about the adventures of two amiably aimless metal-head friends, Wayne (Mike Myers) and Garth (Dana Carvey). From Wayne's basement, the pair broadcast a talk-show called "Wayne's World" on local public access television. The show comes to the attention of a sleazy network executive (Rob Lowe) who wants to produce a big-budget version of "Wayne's World"--and he also wants Wayne's girlfriend, a rock singer named Cassandra (Tia Carrere). Wayne and Garth have to battle the executive not only to save their show, but also Cassandra. Director Penelope Spheeris, Myers and Carvey hang a lot of silly, but funny, jokes on this thin plot, and the energy of the cast--as well as the wild pop-culture references--make Wayne's World a cut above the average Saturday Night Live spin-off movie(n)</desc>

To show his appreciation, Pacelli gives Darrell a job -- serving as bodyguard for this beautiful daughter, Dolly (Emmanuelle Chriqui). A short-lived romance blooms between Darrell and Dolly, but it isn't long before the couple are quarreling, which makes Pacelli more than a bit unhappy with his new hire. However, Pacelli also has a mob war and a disloyal and ambitious young lieutenant to deal with, and Darrell soon finds Pacelli's problems become his problems too.

    <title lang="en">Dark Girls</title>
    <desc lang="en">When Africans were first brought to the United States as slaves, many slave owners took a strange approach to diving the labor among the humans they owned -- lighter skinned blacks were assigned to work inside the house, performing more precise but less physically demanding chores, while their darker skinned brethren were forced to perform punishing manual labor in the fields. In the 21st Century, a grim vestige of this tradition lives on in African-American culture, as women with dark complexion often find themselves looked down upon by their peers, considered less attractive, less intelligent and less refined than women with a lighter skin tone. A variety of African-American women discuss this phenomenon, sharing their thoughts on the social and cultural implications of this subtle but common form of prejudice, in the documentary Dark Girls. Directors Bill Duke and D. Channsin Berry feature interviews with women sharing their own experiences as dark skinned African-Americans, children who reveal how young these beliefs are implanted in girls, and men who share their feelings about women and skin color. Dark Girls was an official selection at the 2011 Toronto Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Rugrats Movie</title>

It's the story of diaper-clad kids, told from a baby's point- of-view, and they were one of the hottest-selling toy franchises of the late '90s. The film features a hilarious musical number in the hospital nursery, where newborns have the voices of major rock stars that include Jakob Dylan (Bob Dylan's son), Iggy Pop, Lou Rawls, Lisa Loeb, and Patti Smith, to name a few. The story escalates when self-proclaimed leader Tommy Pickles is thrust into an impossible situation with the birth of his new brother, Dil Pickles. This new kid is grabbing all the attention and won't stop crying. With the help of other toddlers Lil and Phil, Tommy decides that the baby should be returned to the hospital for fixing. They all hop on their little wagon and take a high-speed ride straight into the deep woods where they realize they're lost. Chased around by animals (or so they think), the Rugrats clan must get home in one piece. Other celebrity voices include Whoopi Goldberg and The Rocky Horror Picture Show's Tim Curry, as well as Saturday Night Live's Andrea Martin and David Spade(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Ponyo</title>
    <desc lang="en">A charming family fantasy-adventure from Hayao Miyazaki - master of Japanese animation and director of Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke - that reworks Hans Christian Andersen's The Little Mermaid. When five-year-old Sosuke is playing down by the water of his fishing town, the last thing he expects to see is a goldfish with girl's face. Her real name is Brunhilde and she's the daughter of Fujomoto, a powerful human wizard who has renounced life on land for one in the ocean's depths. Boy and fish-girl are instantly smitten with each other, and he gives her a new name, Ponyo. She returns to her father to say that she no longer wants to live in the sea and would prefer to be human. Angered at the prospect of losing her, as well as at mankind's ill-treatment of the oceans, Fujimoto unleashes a catastrophe that threatens Ponyo's true love and his terrestrial community..(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Nervous Man in a $4 Room. Though obviously an episode designed to absorb the costs of the more expensive Twilight Zone installments, this was one of the better efforts of the series' second season, with a tour de force performance by Joe Mantell as penny-ante gangster Jackie Rhoades. Ordered to bump off a rival gangster, the timorous Rhoades tries to summon up the courage for the foul deed, only to be thwarted at every turn by his own conscience -- who as it turns out has more "guts" than Jackie ever dreamed of. Though essentially a solo endeavor, the episode also features a good performance from future producer-director William D. Gordon as Jackie's nasty boss, while another future director, Brian G. Hutton, serves as Joe Mantell's back-to-camera stand-in when the actor "confronts" himself. Written by Rod Serling and scored by Jerry Goldsmith, "Nervous Man in a Four Dollar Room" was the first episode produced for Twilight Zone's second season, even though it was telecast as the third episode, on October 14, 1960(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors</title>
    <desc lang="en">The best of the Elm Street sequels, this creepy, surreal fantasy features terrific effects, a fine young cast, and an air of grim fatalism that sets it apart from its giggly successors. Patricia Arquette stars as Kristen, whose nightmare leads to a slashed wrist which looks suspiciously like a suicide attempt. She is placed in a hospital psychiatric ward with a group of six other troubled teens who all dream about the same horribly burned man (Robert Englund) trying to kill them. Perhaps the most unusual thing about this picture, however, is the unexpected depth of sadness running through it. There are some achingly sweet moments in this otherwise frightening film which, though not disruptive, are impossible to analyze. The first and most bizarre of these is Heather Langenkamp's entrance, which inexplicably causes most viewers to get misty-eyed, and there are several similar scenes throughout the film. One answer can be found in the sensitive direction of Chuck Russell, who emphasizes the tragedy and utter hopelessness in these kids' lives and manages to wring some unexpectedly perceptive turns from his cast. This is a film in which a great deal of care was obviously lavished on individual scenes (the sets are outstanding) and performances. The results are well worth repeated viewings, and prove that sequels don't necessarily have to be inferior films(n)</desc>
