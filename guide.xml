    <desc lang="en">In this supernatural thriller, Kevin Costner plays Joe Darrow, a physician mourning the death of his wife Emily (Susannah Thompson) in a bus accident in South America, where she was providing medical outreach. Wracked by grief, Joe works extra shifts at the hospital to take his mind off the tragedy, but the intense workload triggers his short temper and some careless mistakes. His officious boss (Joe Morton) forces Joe to take time off, but Joe feels obligated to check in on his wife's pediatric patients, fulfilling a promise he made before she left. Visiting the ward, Joe starts to believe that Emily is using the near-death experiences of her terminal patients to communicate with him, through images the children report seeing in their dreams, and symbols they are inexplicably compelled to draw. While the children see Joe as a kindred spirit, the hospital staff worries about how these interactions are agitating them. At home, Joe begins finding other ethereal evidence of his wife's attempt to contact him from beyond the grave, some of it featuring the image of a dragonfly, which was the shape of the birthmark on her shoulder. His friends and a caring neighbor (Kathy Bates) worry that Joe is losing his marbles, especially as his quest becomes more frantic, putting his job in jeopardy(n)</desc>

Adapted from the off-Broadway play by Tracy Letts, Bug centers on Agnes (Ashley Judd), who tends bar alongside pal R.C. (Lynn Collins), and has recently moved into a shoddy roadside motel in hopes of avoiding her menacing and recently paroled ex-husband, Jerry (Harry Connick Jr.). Upon making the acquaintance of subdued former soldier Peter (Michael Shannon, repeating his stage role), a veteran of the first Gulf War, Agnes finally senses that things are looking up. Quietly charming despite his melancholy aura, Peter soon reveals to Agnes that he contracted a "bug" while serving in the Middle East, and that it may have been deliberately administered as part of a secret military medical experiment. Convinced that the microscopic insects are quickly multiplying just under the surface of his skin and that they have now infected Agnes as well, Peter soon descends into a psychotic rage as he resorts to increasingly desperate measures to purge himself of the offending subdermal arthropods(n)</desc>

A mediocre student pampered by his mother, a failed artist and a loner, Hitler shirked military service in 1913. But Germany's defeat in World War I turned him into a rabid nationalist who soon became the mouthpiece of a small far-right group. When galloping inflation overtook Germany in 1924, he attempted a coup with his paramilitary Storm Troopers, but it was a terrible failure. Lucky to survive, Hitler was imprisoned and wrote Mein Kampf in his cell. When he was released he restarted his quest for power, this time by legal means. But the Germans weren't worried; they still thought Hitler was just an irrelevant deluded crank on the margins of German politics..(n)</desc>

The trio have the misfortune of working for Franklin Hart Jr - a first class chauvinist, who will quite happily tip pencils on the floor just so he can ogle Rhodes's cleavage while she picks them up. When Newstead is unfairly passed over for promotion for the umpteenth time, the women head for Doralee's house to commiserate and smoke pot, which prompts revenge fantasies from each of them. But then fantasy blends with reality, and events spin out of control for the trio..(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly making a film about conjoined twins sounds like a recipe for stomach-churning grossness, but Stuck on You gets its laughs from others, not the twins. Bo and Walt run a diner in Martha's Vineyard, but Walt yearns for Hollywood stardom. Bo agrees to humour him and they hit LA, where Walt lands a part in a TV series starring Cher (herself): the shy Bo has to be hidden by scenery or "brushed out" from the scene. But Bo harbours a love for LA-based May (Wen Yann Shih), their romance previously conducted on-line, while Walt falls for April (Eva Mendes), an understanding pool babe. Can the disparate pair find love, success and happiness? With cameos from Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Free to Murder Again. The Texas penal system wakes up from a nightmare in the A&amp;E program American Justice: Free to Murder Again. The subject of the documentary is serial killer Kenneth McDuff, the biggest mistake the parole board ever made. McDuff was first sentenced to death in 1968 for killing three teenagers. Seemingly, his incarceration meant the end of his murder spree. But due to the overcrowding of Texas jails, McDuff was eventually released after serving only 21 years. Soon, the criminal was back on the streets harassing children and adults alike. In 1991, McDuff abducted and killed a young woman only to repeat the pattern two years later with a pregnant mother of two. When he was captured and resentenced to death, his murderous trail was reported to include a handful of others. McDuff's situation alerted the government to the failures of the parole boards. His case eventually resulted in a slew of new prison constructions and tough law reforms(n)</desc>

However, it proves a tricky environment for predators, as vision is often blocked, escape routes are numerous, and the terrain makes travelling at speed almost impossible. The programme features footage of tigers using their surroundings to ambush deer and pine martens making tunnels in the snow, as well as examining the strategies adopted by sparrowhawks, jumping spiders, tarsiers, eagles and chimpanzees.(n)</desc>

This year, the strongest El Nino phenomena in recorded history is likely to make things in the bay even more interesting than usual. Liz Bonnin investigates an influx of white sharks, while Steve Backshall dives with playful sea lions, and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall meets a local angling legend who is trying to do his bit for sustainable fishing.

Sperm whales produce clicks to locate giant squid two miles beneath the ocean surface, and narwhals use a similar technique to find breathing holes in Arctic ice floes. Bottlenose dolphins communicate with fishermen in Brazil, humpbacks offer haunting operatic performances and boto dolphins create bat-like ultrasonic calls to help find fish in the murky Amazon River.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Terms of Endearment</title>
    <desc lang="en">Terms of Endearment covers three decades in the lives of widow Aurora Greenaway (Shirley MacLaine) and her daughter Emma (Debra Winger). Fiercely protected by Aurora throughout childhood, Emma runs into resistance from her mother when she marries wishy-washy college teacher Flap (Jeff Daniels). Aurora is even more put out at the prospect of being a grandmother, though she grows a lot fonder of her three grandkids than she does of her son-in-law. Flap proves that Aurora's instincts were on target when he enters into an affair with a student (Kate Charleson). Meanwhile, Emma finds romantic consolation with an unhappily married banker (played by John Lithgow, who registers well in a rare "nice guy" performance). As for Aurora, she is ardently pursued by her next-door neighbor, boisterous astronaut Garrett Breedlove (Jack Nicholson). After 75 minutes or so of pursuing an episodic, semi-comic plotline, the film abruptly shifts moods when Emma discovers that she has terminal cancer. Terms of Endearment won Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay for TV veteran James L. Brooks making his first feature film, Best Actress for MacLaine, and Best Supporting Actor for Nicholson. It was followed by a sequel, The Evening Star (1996), which again featured MacLaine as Aurora(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Pierce Brosnan makes his fourth appearance as suave super-spy James Bond in this espionage thriller, the 20th film in the official Bond series. While on assignment in North Korea, Bond is captured by government agents, where he's imprisoned and tortured for over a year.

As Bond hops from England to Cuba to Korea to Iceland in pursuit of his quarry, he (as usual) makes the acquaintance of two beautiful and mysterious women, Jinx (Halle Berry) and Miranda Frost (Rosamund Pike). Judi Dench and John Cleese return in Die Another Day as, respectively, Bond's superior M and gadget-master Q; Madonna contributes the film's theme song and makes a cameo appearance as a fencing instructor(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Thirteen Days</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Roger Donaldson teams up with star Kevin Costner for another political thriller (after their 1987 pairing, No Way Out), only this time with a film based on the actual events surrounding the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, taking place during the titular thirteen days wherein the U.S. and the Soviet Union nearly engaged in full-scale nuclear war. After President John F. Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood) is shown photographs from a spy plane detailing the presence of missiles in Cuba capable of obliterating massive areas of the U.S., he must immediately decide the most effective course of action for the country. With the aid of best friend and special assistant Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner) and brother Robert (Steven Culp), the President must avoid a dire chain of events that could be dictated by General Curtis LeMay (Kevin Conway), who would rather take immediate action and invade Cuba. After initial reticence about leaking the information to the nation, President Kennedy eventually tells of the conflict, leading to widespread panic and a blockade of Cuba. With the aid of Robert McNamara (Dylan Baker) and Adlai Stevenson (Michael Fairman), the leaders must find a way to alleviate the tension of the situation. Thirteen Days also features Walter Adrian as Lyndon Johnson(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Supercross</title>
    <desc lang="en">Two siblings find themselves competing on and off the racetrack in this action-packed drama. K.C. Carlyle (Steve Howey) and his kid brother, Trip (Mike Vogel), are both racers in the rough and tumble world of supercross, a revved-up variation on motocross racing in which specially modified motorcycle negotiate specially built dirt tracks that send riders through tricky twists and turns, over rough terrain, and off high-flying jumps. Both are talented racers, but K.C. has a wilder and more reckless approach, while Trip follows a more cautious path. A more profound difference between them arises when K.C. is offered a lucrative deal to ride for a factory-sponsored team; he takes the deal, and leaves his brother behind to race on his own dime. However, when an accident takes Trip out of the running on the supercross circuit, he and K.C. set aside their differences as Trip helps coach his older brother so he can succeed in his drive to the championship. Made with the cooperation of a leading supercross race promoter, Supercross: The Movie also stars Sophia Bush and Cameron Richardson as the brothers' love interests, and Robert Carradine as a determined race coach(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Iron Man 3</title>
    <desc lang="en">Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) wrestles with inner demons while contending with monsters of his own creation in this sequel from writerdirector Shane Black. The story in Iron Man 3 picks up shortly after the events of The Avengers. Having previously entered another dimension in order to save New York City, Tony remains deeply haunted by the experience. Unable to sleep, he throws himself into his work with such intensity that it begins to take a heavy toll on both his mental health and his relationship with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). Tony has only started to appreciate the gravity of his problems when an enigmatic terrorist named the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) hijacks the airwaves and threatens to bring America to its knees with a painful series of "lessons" that even President Ellis (William Sadler) won't be able to ignore. When Tony's former security guard Happy Hogan (Favreau) is badly injured in an explosion caused by one of the Mandarin's agents, the vengeful playboy issues a public threat that results in his home being completely destroyed in a devastating attack, leaving him to face his enemy with only one badly damaged prototype suit. Fortunately, Tony isn't on his own, and with the help of Col. James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) and a young boy named Harley (Ty Simpkins), he pieces together the mystery of the Mandarin, whose final "lesson" promises to be the most painful of all(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Secrets of a Successful Marriage. While no one has ever accused Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) of being an intellectual heavyweight, one day he finally tires of people suggesting he's stupid and decides to enroll in an adult education course. He soon discovers, though, that most of the classes he's interested in are being taught by family and friends, and he's too intimidated to attend. Instead, Homer signs up to teach a class of his own on how to have a successful marriage; however, since he doesn't have much to say, most of his students look bored to tears until he starts telling secrets about his wife, Marge (voice of Julie Kavner), including the fact that she dyes her hair and gets turned on when Homer nibbles her elbow. When word of this gets back to Marge, she's understandably furious, and orders Homer not to talk about her in class. But the next time Homer runs out of material in class, he relapses into stories about Marge, and she kicks him out of the house. Marge begins to seriously consider following the advice of Reverend Lovejoy (voice of Harry Shearer) and divorce Homer, while Homer moves into Bart's tree house, desperate to win his wife back. "Secrets of a Successful Marriage" was first aired on May 19, 1994(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Actor Michael Rapaport turns documentary filmmaker with this look at the turbulent career of progressive New York hip-hop outfit A Tribe Called Quest. Interviews with such fans and contemporaries as the Beastie Boys, De La Soul, Ludacris, Kanye West, and Common reveal how the group helped steer collective hip-hop consciousness in an exciting new direction by combining divergent styles and penning positive lyrics before deciding to call it quits back in 1998. Additional interviews with members Ali Shaheed Muhammad, Q-Tip, and Phife Dawg during their 2008 reunion tour offer added insight into their glory days as hip-hop pioneers, and life after A Tribe Called Quest(n)</desc>

It is 1985 and Richard Nixon continues his tenure in the White House, massively popular with the electorate following his crushing defeat of the VIet Cong. However, it seems that the American public have fallen out of love with their superheroes, one of whom, Dr Manhattan, was largely responsible for the winning the VIetnam War. Now, he and his fellow crime-fighters are regarded as reprehensible vigilantes and have been banned by law. But, when one of their number - the vile, ironically named Comedian - is murdered, the former heroes begin to re-emerge from the shadows to investigate. They discover that a terrifying plan is afoot..(n)</desc>

However, it seems that the American public have fallen out of love with their superheroes, one of whom, Dr Manhattan, was largely responsible for the winning the VIetnam War. Now, he and his fellow crime-fighters are regarded as reprehensible vigilantes and have been banned by law. But, when one of their number - the vile, ironically named Comedian - is murdered, the former heroes begin to re-emerge from the shadows to investigate. They discover that a terrifying plan is afoot..(n)</desc>

Consumed with temptations and conflicting desires, Tracy loses her good-girl identity, greatly affecting her relationship with her mom. Partly autobiographical, Thirteen was co-written by Hardwicke and actual 13-year-old Reed, who are close family friends. Originally intending to write a teen comedy, they ended up creating a hard-hitting drama exposing the contemporary teenage experience. Thirteen was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival, with Catherine Hardwicke taking home the Director's Award(n)</desc>

Though physically well suited for the title role, is nowhere near as exciting or charismatic as he was cracked up to be back in 1979. A male prostitute specializing in satisfying the kinky urges of the rich and famous, Gere becomes the fall guy when one of his clients is murdered. Only Lauren Hutton, the wife of a high-profile politician, can provide him with an alibi. Schrader's erotic imagery has never been universally accepted: some applaud him for his keen sense of visual dynamics, while others have written him off as a pricey pornographer. Your enjoyment of American Gigolo may very well come down to whether or not you truly care about what happens to the inscrutable Mr. Gere(n)</desc>

Reared by the Wampanoag tribe following a failed attempt by the Vikings to raid coastal villages for slaves, a ten-year-old shipwreck survivor is nicknamed "Ghost" by his adoptive tribe due to his pale complexion and blond hair. Legend says that death and destruction will follow the boy wherever he travels, yet the peaceful people of the Wampanoag tribe selflessly take the frightened child in as if he is one of their own.

When the rampaging Vikings return to the New World to rain destruction down on the Native Americans and to claim the fertile land of the peaceful people, Ghost finds himself in the precarious position of having to stop his own people from destroying his village and ruthlessly slaughtering the woman he loves (Moon Bloodgood).

Despite the overwhelming evidence against Mr. Krabs -- not to mention having been turned down for a long-awaited promotion at the restaurant -- SpongeBob (voice of Tom Kenny) refuses to believe that his boss is responsible and teams up with his best friend, Patrick (voice of Bill Fagerbakke), on a mission to Shell City, where he hopes he can exonerate Mr. Krabs and return the crown to its rightful owner. Of course, this is no easy task; once outside the safety of Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob is faced with the overwhelming dangers of the sea, not the least of which being a cyclops that many believe to be responsible for the deaths of countless other unfortunate sea-creatures who ventured outside county lines. Among those who lent their vocal chords to the film include Scarlett Johansson, Jeffrey Tambor, and Alec Baldwin(n)</desc>

It's then back to the kitchen to prepare a dessert, again based on MacLeod's brief. This time, the one that doesn't make the grade fails to reach the knockout week.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">MasterChef</title>
    <desc lang="en">John Torode and Gregg Wallace put five more keen cooks to the test in the first of two heats, and as usual they begin by serving up their Calling Card, a dish that showcases their talents. The judges' two favourites then sit it out while the others reinvent what they've just made, creating a new plate of food based on the main ingredient from the first round. After this cook-off, one of the amateurs is sent home, before the remaining four prepare dinner for a trio of former MasterChef champions, after which Friday's first two quarter-finalists will be decided.(n)</desc>

The reporter asks whether the government of the time was to a greater extent influenced by religious morals and considers the legacy of the subsequent legal battle.(n)</desc>

Iris (Snow) is a young woman caught in a heartbreaking family crisis; after losing both of her parents unexpectedly, she is the only one left to care for her severely ill younger brother. With her finances dwindling, she is invited to a mysterious dinner party hosted by debonair millionaire Shepard Lambrick (Jeffrey Combs), who claims that he may hold the answer to all of her problems.

Only one player will be left standing at the end of the game, and that person will receive enough cash that they will never have to worry about money again.

    <title lang="en">Would You Rather</title>
    <desc lang="en">A wealthy aristocrat offers a group of desperate individuals the opportunity to solve all of their financial woes by taking part in a gruesome game of "Would you Rather?" in this pitch-black satire starring Jeffrey Combs and Brittany Snow. Iris (Snow) is a young woman caught in a heartbreaking family crisis; after losing both of her parents unexpectedly, she is the only one left to care for her severely ill younger brother. With her finances dwindling, she is invited to a mysterious dinner party hosted by debonair millionaire Shepard Lambrick (Jeffrey Combs), who claims that he may hold the answer to all of her problems. Later, as Iris and a despondent group of strangers gather in Lambrick's stately dining room, the host invites his guests to take part in a game that could change their lives. The rules are simple: Each player will be posed with a difficult question and given 15 seconds to make a choice -- should they choose incorrectly, the consequences will be fatal. Only one player will be left standing at the end of the game, and that person will receive enough cash that they will never have to worry about money again. Now, with both her own life and the life of her ailing brother on the line, Iris must figure out a way to win the game and survive the night. John Heard, Sasha Grey, Eddie Steeples, and Robb Wells co-star(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Tyler Perry's Meet the Browns</title>
    <desc lang="en">Prolific playwright Tyler Perry adapts his popular stage play of the same name in this family-oriented comedy concerning a desperate mother who connects with the family she never knew. Brenda is a single Chicago mother of three who has been struggling for years to keep her kids off of the streets. Suddenly let go from her job with no warning to speak of, the eternally optimistic mother begins to experience a suffocating sense of hopelessness for the very first time in her life. When Brenda receives a death notice claiming that the father she has never met has passed away, she quickly gathers up the kids and sets out for Georgia to attend the funeral. Upon arriving in the Deep South, the once fretful mother is pleasantly surprised to discover that there is a whole side of the family she never knew existed. A crass but good-natured clan that welcomes Brenda and her children with open arms, the Browns' lazy summer afternoons and frequent trips to the county fair offer a much-needed contrast to the stress of surviving in inner city Chicago. Writer/director/actor Perry reprises his role as indomitable, law-breaking grandmother Madea in a comedy that proves sometimes second chances come when you least expect it(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A hardened detective enters into a tenuous symbiotic relationship with the vicious serial killer she is tracking after earning the respect of the murderous madman in this vicious psychological thriller starring Demi Moore, Kevin Costner, and William Hurt. Earl Brooks (Costner) is a successful businessman, noted philanthropist, and loving father. He's the kind of man whom no one would ever suspect of being a notorious serial killer, but then again history's most dubious psychopaths are often the quiet neighbor whom no one would ever suspect was capable of committing such unspeakable atrocities. Until now, no one has had any reason to link Earl Brooks with the heinous crimes of the dreaded Thumbprint Killer. Even his beautiful wife (Marg Helgenbeger) and teenage daughter (Danielle Panabaker) could never conceive of such an awful truth. But when Mr. Brooks's dark side begins to outshine his sane exterior, an amateur photographer (Dane Cook) captures the killer succumbing to his murderous instinct on film. Now, as Mr. Brooks is pursued by tenacious detective Tracy Atwood (Moore) and forced to bend to the will of an opportunistic bystander, the killer who was once able to keep his murderous alter ego (Hurt) in check finds his control steadily slipping(n)</desc>

That friendship is put to the ultimate test, however, when their adult children begin to act out in ways that neither parent ever saw coming.

    <title lang="en">Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Gore Verbinski and the crew set sail once again for this, the third chapter in the swashbuckling Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is hopelessly trapped in Davy Jones' locker after a harrowing encounter with the dreaded Kracken, and now Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) must align themselves with the nefarious Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) if they hold out any hope of saving their old friend from a fate worse than death. The East India Trading Company and its fearsome leader, Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), have taken control of the ghostly Flying Dutchman and its captain, Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), and now the baleful Admiral Norrington (Jack Davenport) has taken the helm in a relentless bid to destroy every pirate ship in his path and bring the Age of Piracy to a violent close. Meanwhile, Will, Elizabeth, and Captain Barbossa navigate treacherous waters and face bitter betrayal as they set sail to gather the only army that can stand up to Beckett -- The Nine Lords of the Brethren Court. But Captain Jack Sparrow is one of the lords, and as long as he's stuck in Davy Jones' locker, Beckett and his nefarious armada are sure to emerge victorious. There's still hope, however, if the heroic team that includes Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris), Pintel (Lee Arenberg), and Ragetti (Mackenzie Crook) can reach exotic Singapore and convince vulpine pirate Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat) to provide them with charts and a ship. But even the powerful Brethren Court may need a bit of help from volatile sea goddess Calypso in order to weather the coming storm. With the entire future of the pirate way at stake, everyone will be forced to choose sides while drifting precariously to the edge of the earth for one final, spectacular battle(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Wet Hot American Summer</title>
    <desc lang="en">1980s teen comedies finally get the parody they so richly deserve with Wet Hot American Summer, the first feature film from writer/director David Wain and co-screenwriter Michael Showalter, formerly of the sketch comedy troupe the State. It's the last day of the summer season at Camp Firewood, and as camp director Beth (Janeane Garofalo) prepares to wrap things up, the staff of teenage counselors realize this is their last chance to do something about the summer romances that have been brewing for the past three months. Sweet but shy Coop (Michael Showalter) is crazy about pretty Katie (Marguerite Moreau), but there's the problem of her severely moody boyfriend Andy (Paul Rudd). Meanwhile, Victor (Ken Marino) is trying to score with sexy Abby (Marisa Ryan), who is known to make friends easily, and McKinley (Michael Ian Black) and Ben (Bradley Cooper) attempt to keep their hot and heavy relationship a secret. Meanwhile, arts and crafts teacher Gail (Molly Shannon) turns to her students for comfort as her marriage falls apart, drama coach Susie (Amy Poehler) tries to whip the talent show into shape with Ben's help, and camp chef Gene (Christopher Meloni) deals with his unique sexual quirks with the help of a talking can of vegetables (voiced by H. Jon Benjamin). Beth even finds time for romance with socially inept astrophysicist Henry (David Hyde Pierce), but first Henry has to save Camp Firewood from a large piece of space junk about to re-enter Earth's atmosphere. Like Wain and Showalter, Ken Marino, Michael Ian Black, and Joe Lo Truglio (who appears in a small role) were also members of the State; fellow State alumnus Kerri Kenney was cast in a supporting role in the film, but her character didn't appear in the final cut(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Gore Verbinski and the crew set sail once again for this, the third chapter in the swashbuckling Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is hopelessly trapped in Davy Jones' locker after a harrowing encounter with the dreaded Kracken, and now Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) must align themselves with the nefarious Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) if they hold out any hope of saving their old friend from a fate worse than death. The East India Trading Company and its fearsome leader, Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), have taken control of the ghostly Flying Dutchman and its captain, Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), and now the baleful Admiral Norrington (Jack Davenport) has taken the helm in a relentless bid to destroy every pirate ship in his path and bring the Age of Piracy to a violent close. Meanwhile, Will, Elizabeth, and Captain Barbossa navigate treacherous waters and face bitter betrayal as they set sail to gather the only army that can stand up to Beckett -- The Nine Lords of the Brethren Court. But Captain Jack Sparrow is one of the lords, and as long as he's stuck in Davy Jones' locker, Beckett and his nefarious armada are sure to emerge victorious. There's still hope, however, if the heroic team that includes Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris), Pintel (Lee Arenberg), and Ragetti (Mackenzie Crook) can reach exotic Singapore and convince vulpine pirate Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat) to provide them with charts and a ship. But even the powerful Brethren Court may need a bit of help from volatile sea goddess Calypso in order to weather the coming storm. With the entire future of the pirate way at stake, everyone will be forced to choose sides while drifting precariously to the edge of the earth for one final, spectacular battle(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Wet Hot American Summer</title>
    <desc lang="en">1980s teen comedies finally get the parody they so richly deserve with Wet Hot American Summer, the first feature film from writer/director David Wain and co-screenwriter Michael Showalter, formerly of the sketch comedy troupe the State. It's the last day of the summer season at Camp Firewood, and as camp director Beth (Janeane Garofalo) prepares to wrap things up, the staff of teenage counselors realize this is their last chance to do something about the summer romances that have been brewing for the past three months. Sweet but shy Coop (Michael Showalter) is crazy about pretty Katie (Marguerite Moreau), but there's the problem of her severely moody boyfriend Andy (Paul Rudd). Meanwhile, Victor (Ken Marino) is trying to score with sexy Abby (Marisa Ryan), who is known to make friends easily, and McKinley (Michael Ian Black) and Ben (Bradley Cooper) attempt to keep their hot and heavy relationship a secret. Meanwhile, arts and crafts teacher Gail (Molly Shannon) turns to her students for comfort as her marriage falls apart, drama coach Susie (Amy Poehler) tries to whip the talent show into shape with Ben's help, and camp chef Gene (Christopher Meloni) deals with his unique sexual quirks with the help of a talking can of vegetables (voiced by H. Jon Benjamin). Beth even finds time for romance with socially inept astrophysicist Henry (David Hyde Pierce), but first Henry has to save Camp Firewood from a large piece of space junk about to re-enter Earth's atmosphere. Like Wain and Showalter, Ken Marino, Michael Ian Black, and Joe Lo Truglio (who appears in a small role) were also members of the State; fellow State alumnus Kerri Kenney was cast in a supporting role in the film, but her character didn't appear in the final cut(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Hart's War</title>
    <desc lang="en">Based on the novel by John Katzenbach, author of Just Cause (1995), this prison camp drama combines elements of A Soldier's Story (1984) and the classic Stalag 17 (1953). Colin Farrell stars as Lt. Tommy Hart, a second-year Harvard Law School student who enlists to fight in World War II but ends up being taken prisoner by the Germans. When a murder at the Nazi-run Stalag Luft 13 leaves a black Tuskegee airman named Lt. Lincoln Scott (Terrence Dashon Howard) accused of the crime, high-ranking prisoner (and fourth-generation war hero) Col. William McNamara (Bruce Willis) persuades camp commandant Col. Werner Visser (Marcel Iures) to allow the prisoners to hold their own trial. Hart is recruited to defend his fellow officer, but as he reluctantly investigates, he discovers that not all of his fellow allied soldiers are fighting the same war and that his "client" may well have been framed. In the meantime, it becomes apparent that McNamara is using events to mask his true intent, a mission to destroy a nearby munitions plant that he still intends to carry out despite his incarceration. Hart's War (2002) co-stars Vicellous Shannon, Cole Hauser, Rory Cochrane, and Jonathan Brandis(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">A League of Their Own</title>
    <desc lang="en">The All-American Girls' Professional Baseball League was founded in 1943, when most of the men of baseball-playing age were far away in Europe and Asia fighting World War II. The league flourished until after World War II, when, with the men's return, the league was consigned to oblivion. Director Penny Marshall and screenwriters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel re-create the wartime era when women's baseball looked to stand a good chance of sweeping the country. The story begins as a candy-bar tycoon enlists agents to scour the country to find women who could play ball. In the backwoods of Oregon, two sisters -- Dottie (Geena Davis) and Kit (Lori Petty) -- are discovered. Dottie can hit and catch, while Kit can throw a mean fastball. The girls come to Chicago to try out for the team with other prospects that include their soon-to-be-teammates Mae Mordabito (Madonna), Doris Murphy (Rosie O'Donnell), and Marla Hooch (Megan Cavanagh). The team's owner, Walter Harvey (Gary Marshall) needs someone to coach his team and he picks one-time home-run champion Jimmy Dugan (Tom Hanks), who is now a broken-down alcoholic. After a few weeks of training, as Dugan sobers up, the team begins to show some promise. By the end of the season, the team has improved to the point where they are competing in the World Series (which is no big deal, since there are only four teams in the league)(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Fresh</title>
    <desc lang="en">Justifiably hailed as one of the most powerful and innovative films of 1994, screenwriter Boaz Yakin's directorial debut offers a wrenching portrait of a 12-year-old African American boy struggling to survive in a Brooklyn ghetto. The story unspools slowly with a sprawling, nearly silent panorama of the boy's daily life. Fresh (Sean Nelson in his feature film debut) is first seen walking to school, and but for stopping to pick up a delivery from a local drug dealer, he seems like any other boy. While Fresh may appear young and inexperienced, one look into his intelligent, sensitive but street-hardened eyes shows that he is old beyond his years. Shrewd, hard-working and loyal, Fresh is a taciturn youth, and this earns him the respect of the rival drug dealers for whom he works. Both kingpins have become his mentors, and he seems destined to become just like them. Sometimes, Fresh goes to Washington Square to play chess for money. He is a remarkable player, but is no match for his beer-swilling, unemployable father (Samuel L. Jackson), a world class chess player who never had the chance to compete. A ruthless player, his father gives Fresh invaluable advice about the game's nature and ultimately about life itself. Those words come in handy when a schoolyard crisis prompts Fresh to began planning his cold-blooded, methodical escape from ghetto life. During the film, one waits for the stereotypes, the cartoonish two-dimensional characters, inevitable moralizing against an unjust, oppressive society, and the glorified, graphically violent action sequences punctuated by the pounding beat of angry rap music, but Fresh studiously avoids such cliches. The characters are three-dimensional and presented with little judgment; the drug lords are bad men, but they are also very human. His sister is on a ruinous road, but she is not a purely tragic victim. When violence occurs it is ingloriously swift and ugly. Percussionist Stuart Copeland's soundtrack subtly underscores the action(n)</desc>

Ed Gruberman (Justin Whalin) may not possess any actual superpowers, but his passion for fighting crime rivals that of even the greatest comic-book do-gooders. When Ed becomes a member of The Super Capers, an oddball team of aspiring superheroes, it seems as if his dream of fighting crime for real is about to come true. Upon discovering evidence of an evil plot involving gold bullion, an alluring femme fatale, and a powerful criminal mastermind, Ed travels back in time to prevent a disaster the likes of which the world has never seen(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">King Nine Will Not Return. As had been the case with the first season's inaugural episode "Where Is Everybody?", the second season of Twilight Zone opened with a "solo" drama, wherein the protagonist finds himself alone in a bizarre situation, with no memory of how he got there. In "King Nine Will Not Return," Robert Cummings stars as Army Air Force captain James Embry, who awakens to find himself stumbling through the desert, near the wreckage of a WWII bomber. Laboriously putting the pieces together, Embry desperately searches for his fellow crew members, who seemingly appear and disappear right before his eyes. Inspired by the recent disovery of the wreckage of the American bomber Lady Be Good in the Libyan Desert, "King Nine Will Not Return" was written by Rod Serling and first aired September 30, 1960(n)</desc>

Such is his invective against machinery that, inevitably, all the machines in his household band together and turn against him. This was one of those "you can see the end coming a mile away" episodes that tended to weaken Twilight Zone's second season. First telecast October 28, 1960, "A Thing About Machines" was written by Rod Serling(n)</desc>

Out of amusement, they begin feeding coins into the machine -- and before long, Don has become "hooked" on the sinister device. Stafford Repp, who later played Chief O'Hara on TV's Batman, appears as a mechanic. Written by Richard Matheson, "Nick of Time" made its Twilight Zone debut on November 18, 1960(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">The Jimmy</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The Jimmy. The title of this episode refers to a character called The Jimmy who constantly refers to himself in the third-person in addition to making odd-looking athletic shoes. When Kramer attends a benefit for handicapped adults, fresh from getting Novocain at the dentist's office and decked out in a pair of The Jimmy's shoes, crooner Mel Torme mistakes him for one of the guests-of-honor. Meanwhile, Elaine inadvertently finds herself making a date with The Jimmy, George's sweating makes him look guilty at work, and Jerry suspects the copies of Penthouse magazine in his dentist's waiting room have affected the behavior of the doctor and his assistant. Bryan Cranston, later of FOX's Malcolm in the Middle, reprises the role of dentist Tim Whatley and "The Velvet Fog," Mel Torme, appears as himself. Originally airing March 16, 1995, "The Jimmy" was the 17th episode shot for the show's sixth season, despite being the 18th one shown(n)</desc>
