    <desc lang="en">Carol Fuchs adapts writer/director Sandra Nettelbeck's screenplay for the 2001 romantic drama Mostly Martha for this Scott Hicks directed remake starring Catherine Zeta-Jones, Aaron Eckhart, and Patricia Clarkson. Kate Armstrong (Jones) is the master chef who is equally intense both in and out of the kitchen. Though Kate's "Type A" personality serves her well when whipping up meals in the trendy Manhattan eatery where she has made a name for herself, it threatens to sink her when she is named as the guardian of her nine-year-old niece Zoe (Little Miss Sunshine's Abigail Breslin). To complicate matters, an impetuous new sous chef named Nick Palmer (Eckhart) has recently joined the kitchen staff and his freewheeling personality seems to stand in direct opposition to Kate's unwavering perfectionism. Yet, despite the fact that they couldn't be more different on the surface, there's no denying the strong attraction between Kate and Nick. As the rivalry between the competitive cooks gradually gives way to romance, the lessons learned by compromising in the kitchen reveal to Kate the importance of learning to openly express herself in order to truly connect with Zoe and find romance with the good-natured Nick(n)</desc>

Now, two decades on, he's been sacked from his dead-end job, ditched by his girlfriend and forced to move into his sister's attic. However, he unexpectedly - and unwittingly - gets another bite at stardom while preparing for a one-off gig with his 18-year-old nephew Josh's band. The only place Fish can find to rehearse in is very stuffy and humid, so - because he's on his own - he chooses to play naked. But he doesn't realise he's being recorded.

    <desc lang="en">Director/screenwriter David Gordon Green adapts Stewart O'Nan's popular novel to the screen in this feature, which tells the parallel tales of a teenager named Arthur (Michael Angarano) and his onetime babysitter Annie (Kate Beckinsale) -- whose turbulent relationship with her estranged husband, Glenn (Sam Rockwell), leads the small-town waitress down a troubled path. Arthur is a high-school student from a dysfunctional family, and does everything in his power to avoid hanging around the house while mom and dad quarrel. When he's not practicing his trombone and performing with the high-school marching band, Arthur can usually be found bussing tables at the local Chinese restaurant and flirting with older waitress Annie. Annie used to be Arthur's babysitter, and is currently struggling to separate from her former high-school sweetheart, Glenn. But being a single mother isn't easy, especially since the troubled Glenn wants nothing more than to clean up his act and reunite his family. Back at school, Arthur and pretty classmate Lila (Olivia Thirlby) have been bonding over their mutual love for all things geeky. Though the casual friendship shows promise of evolving into something more when Lila expresses her true feelings for Arthur, he can't help but becoming distracted by his chaotic family life: his father is moving out of the family home, and his mother is doing everything in her power to maintain some semblance of normalcy. Realizing that happiness is fleeting as his family becomes shattered and Annie experiences a series of distressing encounters with Glenn, Arthur gradually begins to fall for Lisa despite his growing cynicism concerning long-term relationships. Later, on a cold winter morning, Glenn and Annie's past catches up with them in a blinding flash, and the lives of everyone they know are suddenly and irrevocably changed(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Hunger Games</title>
    <desc lang="en">Jennifer Lawrence stars in Gary Ross's Bafta Award-winning action-thriller adaptation of Suzanne Collins' best-selling novel. The dystopian nation of Panem has emerged from the post-apocalyptic remains of the USA. It's a land governed mercilessly from its wealthy central metropolis, the Capitol: following a series of quashed revolts, it demands an annual tribute from each of its 12 outlying regions of a boy and a girl between the ages of 12 and 18. The youngsters, in a warped method of simultaneously controlling and entertaining Panem's populace, are sentenced to hunt each other in televised lethal combat in an area of enclosed woodland; the last person alive is the winner. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen (Lawrence) is part of the latest contest, having voluntarily taken the place of her younger sister. In addition to her compassion, her resourcefulness, steely determination and collaborative instinct could tip the balance in her favour. But the fight to the death is complicated (for protagonists, viewers and organisers alike) when fellow competitor Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) professes his love for her. However, the film, which touches on themes of wealth inequality, the power of TV and exposure to violence, belongs to Lawrence, whose portrayal of a strong, believable central female character is devoid of the usual sexist fripperies and has drawn widespread critical acclaim. Also starring Woody Harrelson, Stanley Tucci and Elizabeth Banks. While the violence within the movie is largely implied, some younger viewers could still find the tenor of the film disturbing(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Martin Scorsese directs this hard-hitting, highly-acclaimed contemporary gangster drama, based on the memoirs of a real-life Mafia 'wise guy'. Set on the streets of New York, the film follows the rise through the ranks of organised crime of Henry Hill, a small-time hustler who enters the sprawling crime organisation as a runner for neighbourhood don Paul Sorvino. Moving through the mob milieu, Hill comes into contact with veteran Irish hood Robert De Niro, who takes the youngster under his wing to teach him the unwritten rules of the underworld and impress upon him the value of loyalty to the members of his surrogate 'family'(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Departed</title>
    <desc lang="en">Legendary director Martin Scorsese takes the helm for this tale of questionable loyalties and blurring identities set in the South Boston organized crime scene and inspired by the wildly popular 2002 Hong Kong crime film Infernal Affairs. As the police force attempts to reign in the increasingly powerful Irish mafia, authorities are faced with the prospect of sending in an undercover agent or seeing their already frail grip on the criminal underworld slip even further. Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a young cop looking to make a name for himself in the world of law enforcement. Collin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is a street-smart criminal who has successfully infiltrated the police department with the sole intention of reporting their every move to ruthless syndicate head Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). When Costigan is assigned the task of working his way into Costello's tightly guarded inner circle, Sullivan is faced with the responsibility of rooting out the informer before things get out of hand. With the stakes constantly rising and time quickly running out for the undercover cop and his criminal counterpart, each man must work feverishly to reveal his counterpart before his identity is exposed by the other. Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, and Ray Winstone co-star, and writer William Monahan adapts a screenplay originally penned by Alan Mak and Felix Chong(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Titanic</title>
    <desc lang="en">James Cameron's Oscar-laden epic tells of the first and final voyage of the 'unsinkable' luxury liner through the love story of two very different passengers. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Jack Dawson, a brash chancer in the steerage part of the ship who talks his way up to the staterooms and fancy restaurants where he meets Rose DeWitt Bukater. She is promised to Cal Hockley in a loveless match but falls for Jack. The first half of the film establishes their story, the second the fate of the Titanic once it has struck the iceberg. The destinies of all the crew and passengers are mirrored by the tragedy that befalls the two lovers, while spectacular special effects recreate the ship's fate(n)</desc>

Rowling. Rumor has it that the dreaded Lord Voldemort has returned, but Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy) isn't so sure what to make of all the hearsay currently floating around the campus of Hogwarts. Suspecting that Headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) may be fueling the rumors regarding Voldemort's return in order to undermine his authority and lay claim to his job, Fudge entrusts newly arrived Defense Against the Dark Arts professor Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) with the task of tracking Dumbledore and keeping a protective watch over the nervous student body. The young wizards of Hogwarts will need something much more effective than Umbridge's Ministry-approved course in defensive magic if they are to truly succeed in the extraordinary battle that lies ahead, however, and when the administration fails to provide the students with the tools that they will need to defend Hogwarts against the fearsome powers of the Dark Arts, Hermione (Emma Watson), Ron (Rupert Grint), and Harry take it upon themselves to recruit a small group of students to form "Dumbledore's Army" in preparation for the ultimate supernatural showdown(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Ninth Gate</title>
    <desc lang="en">An authority on rare books is drawn into a confrontation with the forces of darkness in this thriller directed by Roman Polanski. Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) is a rare book broker who makes his living tracking down valuable items for rich bibliophiles. Corso is hired by Boris Balkan (Frank Langella), a millionaire New Yorker with a vast collection of occult literature and a keen interest in "The Nine Gates to the Kingdom of Shadows." Legend has it that the book was co-written by Satan in the 17th century, and only three copies are known to exist; the owner of one recently sold the book to Balkan a few days before killing himself. Balkan wants Corso to find the other two copies (one owned by a Mr. Fargas in Portugal and the other by a French collector named Kessler) and examine them to determine if they are forgeries. Corso is told to be thorough and spare no expense. He begins by visiting Liana Telfer (Lena Olin), the widow of the man who once owned Balkan's copy of the book, who has an unusually strong desire to get the book back, and confers with his friend Bernie (James Russo), who soon turns up dead, in a manner much like an illustration from the book. Corso learns that the book contains clues to a puzzle that will allow people to call up the devil, and certain people will stop at nothing to find the missing parts of the formula(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Scotland v Wales.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Scotland v Wales (Kick-off 2.25pm). John Inverdale presents coverage of the third match of this year's tournament for both sides, which takes place at Murrayfield. Vern Cotter's Scots will be hoping to end their dismal run of nine straight losses at the hands of the Welsh. After suffering a record 51-3 drubbing in Cardiff three years ago, Scotland have lost their last two meetings with Wales by the much smaller margins of three and four points respectively. Both teams narrowly lost a fortnight ago to France and England respectively and defeat here would almost certainly end any lingering title hopes.

    <sub-title lang="en">Slipping Under.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Steph, the woman responsible for Grace's hospitalisation, is rushed into the ER after attempting suicide in prison. The staff face an upward struggle in finding out what pills she has taken, one which is made all the more difficult by the patient's refusal to speak - and the cold distain of both Connie and Jacob. However, when it becomes clear Connie visited Steph in prison not long before she tried to claim her own life, things become even more complicated. Meanwhile, Iain helps Gem to get a job in the hospital coffee shop, and when Grace's continued silence is ruled as being a psychological issue, Sam decides it may be time to take her home.(n)</desc>

From dense forests to snow-capped peaks, steamy swamps to endless savannah, it's also a land of unpredictable extremes, where creatures must adapt to survive. In Tanzania, a tiny lizard risks its life to eat flies from the face of a sleepy lion. The nesting habits of the 4ft shoebill are also captured on camera - the giant bird has two chicks, but due to sibling rivalry only one will survive. On the plains of Amboseli, a baby elephant is near to death in the drought, so its mother leaves the herd to stay with her offspring until the bitter end.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Terry Pratchett: Back in Black</title>
    <desc lang="en">A dramatised documentary telling the story of the life of Terry Pratchett, the fantasy author whose popular Discworld series made him a household name, selling more then 85 million copies worldwide. In 2015, following a prolonged and very public battle with Alzheimers, Terry died, leaving behind one last unfinished story - his own. Here, actor Paul Kaye steps into the celebrated writer's shoes, charting Terry's life from his troubled schooldays and his difficulties securing the respect of literary critics, through to his eventual success, and his gradual decline into ill health. The film makes use of Terry's own words, along with those of his friend and collaborator Neil Gaiman, contemporary Val McDermid, and long-serving assistant Rob Wilkins.(n)</desc>

After her undercover mission at the Miss United States pageant becomes public knowledge, Gracie becomes something of a celebrity, and the FBI uses her notoriety to generate positive PR for the bureau; however, Gracie would like to get back to some solid police work, especially after scuffling with fellow female agent "Sam" Fuller (Regina King), who isn't impressed with Gracie. Despite their differences, the two find themselves working side by side when two of Gracie's pals from the pageant -- contest winner Cheryl Frasier (Heather Burns) and master of ceremonies Stan Fields (William Shatner) -- fall victim to kidnappers. As she did on the first film, Sandra Bullock served as both producer and star for Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous, while director John Pasquin's credits include several episodes of the situation comedy George Lopez, also produced by Bullock(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A mechanic who moonlights as an underground race-car driver strives to take the top prize in America's most prominent street race in order to have his revenge against the ambitious ex-NASCAR champ who had him framed and sent to prison. Inspired by the popular video-game franchise of the same name, Need for Speed tells the story of garage owner Tobey Marshall (Aaron Paul). Desperate to keep his family-owned business afloat, Marshall forms an uncomfortable partnership with wealthy ex-NASCAR star Dino Brewster (Dominic Cooper). That partnership falls apart when a lucrative sale to car broker Julia Bonet (Imogen Poots) fails to pan out, and unscrupulous Brewster uses a tragic street-racing mishap to have the innocent Marshall incarcerated. Released from prison two years later, the vengeful Marshall plots to prove his mettle by winning the De Leon -- an illicit race showcasing the country's top underground talents. But getting to the De Leon will be no simple task, because not only has the ruthless Brewster put a bounty on Marshall's prized car, but the police are hot on his trail during the white-knuckle, coast-to-coast dash. Fortunately for Marshall, his loyal crew and Bonet are willing to help him get to the starting line in time for the big race.

    <title lang="en">Heists</title>
    <sub-title lang="en">Secrets of the Great Train Robbery.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Crime documentary, which sets out to bust myths surrounding the effectiveness of the now-legendary Royal Mail train heist of August 8, 1963. The robbery saw the thieves walk away with around £2.5million, equivalent to nearly £50million in today's currency, and while similarly scaled heists have been mounted since, none has captured the public imagination in the same way. While the criminals responsible were eventually brought to justice, common perception still views them as successful in their endeavour. This programme aims to highlight the array of mistakes, bad decisions and careless errors that would prove to be the robbers' undoing. Includes contributions by two police officers involved in the investigation, and Tommy Wisbey, one of the last surviving members of the gang that did the deed.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Ninth Gate</title>
    <desc lang="en">An authority on rare books is drawn into a confrontation with the forces of darkness in this thriller directed by Roman Polanski. Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) is a rare book broker who makes his living tracking down valuable items for rich bibliophiles. Corso is hired by Boris Balkan (Frank Langella), a millionaire New Yorker with a vast collection of occult literature and a keen interest in "The Nine Gates to the Kingdom of Shadows." Legend has it that the book was co-written by Satan in the 17th century, and only three copies are known to exist; the owner of one recently sold the book to Balkan a few days before killing himself. Balkan wants Corso to find the other two copies (one owned by a Mr. Fargas in Portugal and the other by a French collector named Kessler) and examine them to determine if they are forgeries. Corso is told to be thorough and spare no expense. He begins by visiting Liana Telfer (Lena Olin), the widow of the man who once owned Balkan's copy of the book, who has an unusually strong desire to get the book back, and confers with his friend Bernie (James Russo), who soon turns up dead, in a manner much like an illustration from the book. Corso learns that the book contains clues to a puzzle that will allow people to call up the devil, and certain people will stop at nothing to find the missing parts of the formula(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">An authority on rare books is drawn into a confrontation with the forces of darkness in this thriller directed by Roman Polanski. Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) is a rare book broker who makes his living tracking down valuable items for rich bibliophiles. Corso is hired by Boris Balkan (Frank Langella), a millionaire New Yorker with a vast collection of occult literature and a keen interest in "The Nine Gates to the Kingdom of Shadows." Legend has it that the book was co-written by Satan in the 17th century, and only three copies are known to exist; the owner of one recently sold the book to Balkan a few days before killing himself. Balkan wants Corso to find the other two copies (one owned by a Mr. Fargas in Portugal and the other by a French collector named Kessler) and examine them to determine if they are forgeries. Corso is told to be thorough and spare no expense. He begins by visiting Liana Telfer (Lena Olin), the widow of the man who once owned Balkan's copy of the book, who has an unusually strong desire to get the book back, and confers with his friend Bernie (James Russo), who soon turns up dead, in a manner much like an illustration from the book. Corso learns that the book contains clues to a puzzle that will allow people to call up the devil, and certain people will stop at nothing to find the missing parts of the formula(n)</desc>

Stationed in a small town near the Canadian border, the troopers don't have much to do, so they while away their hours smoking dope and harassing hapless motorists. Their superior officer, Capt.

When Governor Jessman (Lynda Carter) announces massive budget cuts for Vermont law enforcement personnel, things look bad for the troopers and they must quickly prove their worth or they'll be forced to look for real jobs. Appropriately enough, the troopers stumble upon some information regarding a group of marijuana dealers operating along the border; the guys figure this is just the sort of high-profile bust that could save their careers, but the police department of a nearby town gets wind of the troopers' plans.

    <desc lang="en">Meet the big birds, a feathered family who've never flown a day in their lives. From ostriches to kiwis, these bizarre birds appear to be nature's greatest novelty act. How they came to be and how they continue to survive is a fascinating tale that has long captivated David Attenborough. In this programme, he tells a story of dedicated dads, enormous eggs and a serious need for speed. And far from being the court jesters of the animal world, these flightless curiosities once nearly ruled the planet.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Rescue Dawn</title>
    <desc lang="en">Acclaimed filmmaker Werner Herzog returns to direct his first feature since 2001's Invincible with this dramatic action film inspired by his own 1997 documentary Little Dieter Needs to Fly and detailing the escape efforts of a German-American pilot who was taken as a prisoner-of-war after being shot down over Laos during the Vietnam War. When U.S. fighter pilot Dieter Dengler (Christian Bale) escaped death after being shot down over one of the most intense front lines in the Vietnam War, his troubles were only beginning. Subsequently taken captive by the enemy and forced to endure a harrowing stint in a Vietnamese prison camp, Dengler and his fellow captives stage a death-defying escape that would later inspire one of Germany's most accomplished directors to capture the remarkable tale on camera(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Reign Of Fire</title>
    <desc lang="en">Medieval fantasy meets futuristic science fiction in this effects-heavy action epic from former X-Files director Rob Bowman. In present-day London, 12-year-old Quinn Abercromby witnesses the awakening of a hibernating dragon from a centuries-long slumber, the result of a construction dig supervised by his mother and an incident for which Quinn feels partially responsible. Twenty years later, the adult Quinn is the fire chief of a refortified castle community, responsible for dousing the blazes lit by the dragon's prodigious number of flame-spewing offspring, airborne juggernauts that have wreaked havoc across the globe, torching civilization and turning humans into an endangered species. Hope arrives in the form of Denton "Dragon Slayer" Van Zan, an American known to be the only man to ever kill one of the dragons, and Alex Jenson, a scientist/pilot who's a member of Van Zan's army, a zealous fighting force that includes a secret weapon: the Archangels, paratroopers using themselves as bait to attract and then dispatch the deadly beasts(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The last quarter-final sees the four heat winners take on the fiendishly difficult palate test, recreating John Torode's Singapore chilli crab, having only had a couple of minutes to taste the dish and write down what they think the ingredients are. It's a tricky recipe with a fiery chilli and black-bean paste that also requires them to prepare and cook a whole crab. Can they rise to the challenge? They then rustle up a showstopping dish for the judges and food critic Kate Spicer, before finding out who has made it through to the semi-finals.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">After five weeks of heats, 60 hopefuls have been whittled down to the most promising 10. But if they thought it was tough getting this far, the knockout stage will really sort the dishwashers from the chefs, as over the next two nights the remaining contestants are split into two groups of five and get their first taste of professional cooking. Tonight's group heads to London's Caxton Grill, where 2013 MasterChef: The Professionals finalist Adam Handling is head chef for a busy lunchtime service. Then it's back to the studio to rustle up a dish from an array of seasonal produce for renowned chef Marcus Wareing and the judges, John Torode and Gregg Wallace, who will then send one of the hopefuls home.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The last quarter-final sees the four heat winners take on the fiendishly difficult palate test, recreating John Torode's Singapore chilli crab, having only had a couple of minutes to taste the dish and write down what they think the ingredients are. It's a tricky recipe with a fiery chilli and black-bean paste that also requires them to prepare and cook a whole crab. Can they rise to the challenge? They then rustle up a showstopping dish for the judges and food critic Kate Spicer, before finding out who has made it through to the semi-finals.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">After five weeks of heats, 60 hopefuls have been whittled down to the most promising 10. But if they thought it was tough getting this far, the knockout stage will really sort the dishwashers from the chefs, as over the next two nights the remaining contestants are split into two groups of five and get their first taste of professional cooking. Tonight's group heads to London's Caxton Grill, where 2013 MasterChef: The Professionals finalist Adam Handling is head chef for a busy lunchtime service. Then it's back to the studio to rustle up a dish from an array of seasonal produce for renowned chef Marcus Wareing and the judges, John Torode and Gregg Wallace, who will then send one of the hopefuls home.(n)</desc>

Campus legend has it that 25 years earlier Pendleton was the site of a mass murder by a demented abnormal psych instructor who killed six students and then himself. However, no proof of the prof's deed remains. Urban legends are the subject of a course in American folklore taught by Professor Wexler (Robert Englund). When a series of bizarre deaths occur on the campus, assertive student Natalie thinks they are murders based on urban legends, but classmates Brenda (Rebecca Gayheart), ambitious journalism major Paul (Jared Leto), and practical joker Damon (Joshua Jackson) claim it's just a coincidence. Then Natalie begins to realize that she's the next victim. Since Joshua Jackson is a co-lead on TV's Dawson's Creek, an inside joke surfaces when a radio plays a bit of the Dawson's Creek theme (Paula Cole's I Don't Want to Wait)(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Brown Sugar</title>
    <desc lang="en">A woman wonders if it's just friendship or real love she feels when a close male friend announces he's tying the knot in this romantic comedy. Dre (Taye Diggs) and Sidney (Sanaa Lathan) became best friends when they were ten years old -- the same time that both first became aware of the first rumblings of the Hip Hop revolution in New York City. Today, Dre runs a successful record label, and Sidney is a respected music journalist; both have managed to turn their love for the music into careers, and both are still close friends. Close enough, in fact, that many of their pals wonder why they've never become boyfriend and girlfriend.

Today, Dre runs a successful record label, and Sidney is a respected music journalist; both have managed to turn their love for the music into careers, and both are still close friends. Close enough, in fact, that many of their pals wonder why they've never become boyfriend and girlfriend. While both have always denied their attraction to one another, Sidney begins to have second thoughts when Dre proposes to his girlfriend Reese (Nicole Ari Parker), a lawyer. Even though Sidney has a relationship of her own with professional basketball player Kelby (Boris Kodjoe), as Dre's wedding draws closer, Sidney begins to suspect that her longtime best friend is actually the love of her life. Brown Sugar features supporting performances form real life Hip Hop stars Mos Def and Queen Latifah; former basketball star Earvin "Magic" Johnson served as executive producer(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Junior</title>
    <desc lang="en">Ultimate manly man Arnold Schwarzenegger learns what it's like to be an expectant mother in director Ivan Reitman's high-concept comedy. Schwarzenegger plays Dr. Hess, a medical researcher working on a revolutionary drug to help mothers carry endangered infants to term. When government regulations prevent Dr. Hess from testing the drug through normal channels, his partner Dr. Arbogast (Danny DeVito) develops an unorthodox solution: they will steal a female egg and implant it in Hess, who will carry the child himself. Predictably, much of the subsequent humor centers on the incongruous sight of the muscular Schwarzenegger undergoing the trials and tribulations of pregnancy, from morning sickness to labor pains. Emma Thompson returns to her comic roots and provides romantic interest as an incorrigibly clumsy but intelligent scientist who catches on to Hess' deception. Reitman, Schwarzenegger, and DeVito had previously had a hit with Twins (1988), which revolved around a similarly ludicrous medical premise, but they failed to repeat that film's success here, as audiences largely ignored the film and reviewers criticized the humor as disappointingly obvious(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Ireland v France.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Ireland v France (Kick-off 4.50pm). Coverage of the match from the third round of fixtures, which takes place at Aviva Stadium in Dublin. Both nations enter this clash having lost their opening match of the tournament, but then winning their second, and will be keen to register a victory here to ensure they remain in contention for the title. Having lost a close encounter away to Scotland in round one, Ireland followed that up with a comfortable 63-10 away to Italy, whereas France were beaten by England at Twickenham in their first outing, but triumphed 22-16 over Scotland last time out. Presented by Mark Pougatch, with studio analysis from Brian O'Driscoll, Jonny Wilkinson and Gareth Thomas, pitchside analysis from Olivier Magne and Shane Williams, commentary by Miles Harrison, Gordon D'Arcy and Ben Kay, and reports from Gabriel Clarke.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">New series. The award-winning presenter duo's weekend variety show returns, and this year, the pair have recruited Gogglebox star and I'm A Celebrity 2016 winner Scarlett Moffatt to become their new co-host. Ant and Dec have teased they have a very big role for Scarlett to fill in the first show, one that involves a very public stunt that could see her reach new heights - literally. The Geordie twosome prank Jamie Oliver in the first of this year's Undercover features, and The Voice UK coach Jennifer Hudson stars in the End of the Show Show. Also beginning tonight is The Missing Crown Jewels, Ant and Dec's follow-up to Who Shot Simon Cowell?, last year's comedy sketch whodunit. Emilia Fox is back to head up the investigation, as more celebrity guests are lined up as potential culprits in another mad-cap crime caper.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Dubbed `The Beast' by Winston Churchill, Tirpitz was Nazi Germany's most powerful battleship. Protected by an elite squadron of fighters, it was seen as invincible, but after 34 failed attempts to sink it, the RAF sent in the 617 `Dambusters' Squadron and 9 Squadron. In a raid in November 1944 they managed to slip through enemy defences and destroy Tirpitz. With eyewitness accounts from surviving RAF crew, one of the Luftwaffe fighter pilots and German sailors, this documentary tells this extraordinary story and offers new evidence to explain the mission's improbable success.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The story of what really happened on June 1, 2009, when Air France Flight 447 from Rio de Janeiro to Paris plummeted into the Atlantic Ocean, killing all 228 passengers and crew. It remained a mystery how one of the world's most technologically advanced planes could seemingly just drop out of the sky, until a two-year search finally located the black-box recorders. This documentary reveals the scene on board the doomed airliner as the pilots struggled to understand the catastrophe unfolding before them, and asks what lessons have been learnt from the disaster.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Scientists, pilots and aviation experts participate in a staged aeroplane crash in a remote area of Mexican desert, hoping the exercise will reveal more about what happens to aircraft and their occupants during forced emergency landings. Pilot James `JimBob' Slocum will put a Boeing 727 passenger jet on a crash course, parachuting out minutes before impact - with former US Navy pilot Leland `Chip' Shanle then taking charge of the craft via remote control from a chase plane. After the crash, experts will analyse the site, along with data collected from cameras, instruments and hi-tech crash test dummies, to learn more about what happens when planes are forced out of the sky.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Birth of Oceans. 70% of Earth's surface is covered with liquid water but how did it get here? Our water is one of the greatest paradoxes in science today, because although cool enough to have water now, things where much hotter when our planet first formed. At 93 million miles from the sun it was too hot for Earth to form with water, so where did our oceans come from? For decades scientists were in agreement that it was delivered from the cold outer reaches of the solar system by icy comets. However, in the 1980s the discovery that comet water was subtly different to the water on Earth left scientists baffled, they had to put aside everything they thought they knew and start again. This puzzle has lead to a number of different theories, however most now think that Earth's water arrived in a number of different ways and this has amazing implications. If Earth has more than one source of water then the chances of finding another Earth-like planet that also has liquid water have just shot up, and because you can't have life without this magic liquid, so too have the chances that we are not alone(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Skeletons. NCIS (Naval Criminal Investigative Service) is more than just an action drama. With liberal doses of humour, it's a show that focuses on the sometimes complex and always amusing dynamics of a team forced to work together in high stress situations. Leading this troupe of colourful personalities is NCIS Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs, a former Marine gunnery sergeant, whose skills as an investigator are unmatched. Gibbs is a man of few words, who only needs a look to explain it all. Working under Gibbs is Special Agent Anthony Dinozzo, an ex-homicide detective who may come off as the world's oldest frat boy, but whose instincts in the field are unparalleled(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Scotland v Wales (Kick-off 2.25pm). Daire O'Brien presents coverage of the third match of this year's tournament for both sides, which takes place at Murrayfield. Vern Cotter's Scots will be hoping to end their dismal run of nine straight losses at the hands of the Welsh. After suffering a record 51-3 drubbing in Cardiff three years ago, Scotland have lost their last two meetings with Wales by the much smaller margins of three and four points respectively. With analysis from Brent Pope, Ronan O'Gara and Shane Horgan, and commentary by Hugh Cahill and John Beattie.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Ireland v France (Kick-off 4.50pm). Daire O'Brien presents coverage of the match from the third round of fixtures, which takes place at Aviva Stadium in Dublin. Both nations enter this clash having lost their opening match of the tournament, but then winning their second, and will be keen to register a victory here to ensure they remain in contention for the title. Having lost a close encounter away to Scotland in round one, Ireland followed that up with a comfortable 63-10 victory away to Italy, whereas France were beaten by England at Twickenham in their first outing, but triumphed 22-16 over Scotland last time out.

    <title lang="en">The Eye</title>
    <desc lang="en">Sydney Wells (Jessica Alba) has been given the gift of sight, but it comes with a horrifying price in the English-language remake of Danny and Oxide Pang's The Eye. The double corneal transplant was to open up a new world for Sydney, a concert violinist whose blindness has plagued her since childhood. With the help of Dr. Paul Faulkner (Alessandro Nivola) and sister Helen (Parker Posey), Sydney's operation and recovery seemed to be on the road to success -- until horrific images start to tear their way into her newfound vision. What's worse is that these episodes appear to foreshadow future deadly events, leading Sydney on a mission to track down the person whose eyes she has inherited and discover what kind of mystery from beyond the grave lies before her. The film is directed by David Moreau and Xavier Palud, the duo behind the acclaimed 2006 French terror flick Them, and is produced by Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner under their Cruise/Wagner production banner(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Eye</title>
    <desc lang="en">Sydney Wells (Jessica Alba) has been given the gift of sight, but it comes with a horrifying price in the English-language remake of Danny and Oxide Pang's The Eye. The double corneal transplant was to open up a new world for Sydney, a concert violinist whose blindness has plagued her since childhood. With the help of Dr. Paul Faulkner (Alessandro Nivola) and sister Helen (Parker Posey), Sydney's operation and recovery seemed to be on the road to success -- until horrific images start to tear their way into her newfound vision. What's worse is that these episodes appear to foreshadow future deadly events, leading Sydney on a mission to track down the person whose eyes she has inherited and discover what kind of mystery from beyond the grave lies before her. The film is directed by David Moreau and Xavier Palud, the duo behind the acclaimed 2006 French terror flick Them, and is produced by Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner under their Cruise/Wagner production banner(n)</desc>

This episode contains the first of many significant references to owls throughout the series. Agent Cooper learns his old partner, Windom Earle, has escaped a mental institution and is missing. Taking over Laura's old job with Meals on Wheels, Donna delivers food to Mrs. Tremond (Frances Bay) and the magical boy (played by the director's son, Austin Jack Lynch), who delivers the message: "J'ai une âme solitaire," meaning "I have a lonely soul." When the deal with the Icelandic investors gets thwarted by a crazed Leland, Ben and Jerry threaten a scheme to get rid of him. Meanwhile, Bobby and Shelly begin a scheme of their own to deal with the still-comatose Leo. After the Log Lady tells Major Briggs to deliver the message, he meets with Agent Cooper and shows him the message: "The owls are not what they seem." After learning details about Laura's connection to One-Eyed Jacks, Audrey is caught by Blackie. She calls Agent Cooper for help, who is having a dream in which the Giant gives him another clue(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Lonely Souls. Originally broadcast on November 10, 1990, Episode 14 of Twin Peaks, "Lonely Souls," was written by Mark Frost and directed by David Lynch. This pivotal episode answers some of the series' long-running questions, as well as providing insight into Laura Palmer's killer. Featuring guest singer Julee Cruise, the brutal ending scenes flash between realities. In the morning, Maddy tells Leland and Sarah that she plans to go back to Missoula, MO. Meanwhile, Deputy Hawk searches the murder scene at Harold Smith's house, finding what is left of Laura's secret diary and a suicide note reading "J'ai une ame solitaire" ("I have a lonely soul"). Trying to solve his money problems, Bobby searches Leo's boots and finds some incriminating evidence. Audrey confronts her father about One-Eyed Jacks, and Ben reveals his connection to Laura. After looking over the diary, Cooper has Ben dragged out of his office and placed in a holding cell. At the Blue Pine Lodge, Pete Martell (Jack Nance) discovers the hidden identity of the mysterious Mr. Tojamura. That evening at the Palmers' house, Maddy smells burning oil, Sarah sees a vision of the white horse, and BOB reveals himself. At the Roadhouse, the Log Lady knows what is going on and Cooper sees a vision of the Giant, who warns, "It is happening again."(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Orange County</title>
    <desc lang="en">Some cast and crew from NBC's highly acclaimed, little-seen series Freaks and Geeks reunite for this teen comedy that also marks the first starring role for Tom Hanks' son, Colin. The younger Hanks plays Shaun Brumder, a high schooler eager to propel himself out of the land of surf bums and ranch homes to which the film's title refers. He's had his sights set on Stanford ever since he read the works of professor Marcus Skinner (Kevin Kline), and his transcript is stellar enough to gain him admission. Shaun is understandably furious, then, when he receives a rejection letter in the mail; after some detective work on his part, he realizes that his flaky counselor (Lily Tomlin) mistakenly sent the university the wrong papers. It's up to him to get to Stanford within 24 hours to set the record straight -- literally -- and he enlists the help of his slacker brother Lance (Jack Black) to do so. Orange County co-stars Catharine O'Hara and John Lithgow as Shaun and Lance's slightly unhinged parents; the film was directed by Jake Kasdan and written by Mike White, both of whom contributed to several episodes of Freaks and Geeks(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Tyler Perry's Diary of a Mad Black Woman</title>
    <desc lang="en">A woman has to learn how to love and trust men all over again in this comedy drama. Helen McCarter (Kimberly Elise) would seem to have it all -- she's been married for 18 years to Charles (Steve Harris), and over the course of their time together, he's become one of Atlanta's most successful attorneys. But despite wealth and prestige, things are not as they should be at the McCarter home, and on their anniversary, Charles drops a bombshell on Helen -- he's divorcing her for another woman. Escorted out of the house with nowhere to go, Helen moves in with her grandmother Madea (Tyler Perry), a sassy woman with no shortage of opinions and a gun that she's not afraid to use. As Madea helps Helen get back on her feet emotionally, the divorcée makes the acquaintance of Orlando (Shemar Moore), a handsome man who is obviously attracted to her. But after her experiences with Charles, Helen isn't sure if she's ready to trust a man again. Diary of a Mad Black Woman was adapted from the popular stage play by Tyler Perry, who also plays several roles in the film, most prominently Madea; it marked the first feature-film credit for successful music video director Darren R.

    <title lang="en">The Hurt Locker</title>
    <desc lang="en">Kathryn Bigelow's compelling fact-based, Iraq-set bomb disposal drama was scripted by journalist Mark Boal, drawing on his experiences while embedded with a United States Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal team in 2004. The focus is on the complex characters making up Bravo Company, who disable and destroy improvised explosive devices. The days are ticking down to the end of the bomb squad's tour, but their role puts the team in harm's way around the clock. And it doesn't help that one of the team is addicted to risk taking and pays scant attention to standard procedure, putting other lives in danger, as well as his own. The Hurt Locker provides a tense glimpse into the lives of these extraordinary men, and also probes the various psychologies of people whose job could kill them at any moment, as well as - briefly - exploring how they cope once away from their adrenaline-soaked vocation(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Roll Bounce</title>
    <desc lang="en">A handful of inner-city kids move up to the big time in this teen-centric musical. Xavier Smith (Bow Wow), known to his friends as X, is a teenager growing up on the South Side of Chicago in the late '70s. X and his buddies are the hotshot skaters at the Palisades Gardens, a neighborhood roller rink where local kids roll to the latest disco sounds, but X loses his status as king of the hill when the Palisades closes down. With no skating action close by, X and his friends head uptown to the Sweetwater Roller Rink, where they feel like country mice in the big city among the expert skate dancers and beautiful women. But skating means a lot to X -- with his widower father, Curtis (Chi McBride) going through a bad patch, skating gives him a sense of accomplishment and a belief in his own talent. So X and company keep heading uptown to Sweetwater, where they prepare to take on Sweetness (Wesley Jonathan) and his crew of the rink's best dancers for the upcoming Roller Jam Skate-Off. X befriends a young local girl named Tori (Jurnee Smolett) and finds a good reason to go uptown when he meets a pretty skater girl, Naomi (Meagan Good). Meanwhile, Tori's mother, Vivian (Kellita Smith) takes an interest in Curtis. Featuring a score of classic '70s R&amp;B and disco, Roll Bounce was directed by Malcolm D. Lee, who enjoyed a breakthrough hit with 2002's Undercover Brother(n)</desc>

In one, she is the neighbour of indie filmmaker Susan and her "resting" actor husband Hobie, into whose lives she comes, tempting Hobie towards adultery until Melinda begins a relationship, assuaging his guilt. In the other, she's the friend of Laura and her alcoholic husband Lee, a serial adulterer: can Melinda escape his clutches? Playing one set of circumstances for comedy, the other for tragedy, and cutting between the two scenarios throughout, the film is a fascinating study of character moulding by the director that keeps the viewer guessing until the very end(n)</desc>

Jane's son Sam and his fiancée Alex, are both recent graduates of Harvard medical school. Conservative and serious, the couple move to Los Angeles to complete their studies, planning to stay in Jane's home, which she had promised would be vacant. But when they arrive, Sam is distressed to discover Jane and the band still working in Jane's home recording studio. Jane's carefree lifestyle is anathema to Sam, who has devoted his life to being anyone but his mother's son. Sam and Alex grudgingly agree to stay at Jane's house until they can find an alternative place to live. Once in the house, however, Sam and Alex's tight control over their lives begins to unravel. Increasingly, Alex finds herself seduced by Jane and Ian, leaving Sam adrift, vulnerable to the approach of fellow medical resident Sara(n)</desc>

But when Edward is diagnosed with terminal cancer, William returns to the family home to try and make his peace, and find out who his father really is. Bed-bound, and with an audience of not just the cynical William but also his receptive wife Josephine, Edward recounts his remarkable life in fragments(n)</desc>

In the midst of a surprise birthday party, the revellers are shocked to hear a Civil Defense announcement on the radio, declaring that America is under attack from UFOs. Only Dr. Stockton (Larry Gates) has had the foresight to build a bomb shelter, and before long, he and his family are besieged by desperate neighbors, demanding to be allowed to take refuge in Stockton's cellar. As tensions reach a fever pitch, all of the suppressed hostilities and prejudices of the neighbors come rushing to the surface -- a dangerous situation reminiscent of the finale of the first-season episode "The Monsters are Due on Maple Street," minus the extraterrestrial punchline. Written by Rod Serling, "The Shelter" first aired on September 29, 1961(n)</desc>
