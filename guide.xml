    <title lang="en">Paul O'Grady's Hollywood</title>
    <desc lang="en">The TV presenter continues his comprehensive exploration of the bombastic side of Hollywood, this time turning his attention to musical numbers that have elevated the popularity of their respective films. Over the years, Tinseltown musicals have touched on a wide variety of cinematic genres, from the family-friendly fantasies to urban dance and even more macabre territory via The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Here, Paul revisits Mary Poppins' tongue-twisting Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, Pinball Wizard from Tommy, and a variety of numbers from Fame and Flashdance. He also sheds light on how Disney animation studios are keeping the musical genre alive, with blockbuster hits such as Frozen, which came complete with its own Oscar-winning girl-power anthem Let It Go. Includes contributions by Jonathan Ross, Celine Dion, Maureen Lipman and more.(n)</desc>

Having met once before on a traffic stop, the two men are less than thrilled to be paired together as security guards. When the two men discover a complex smuggling scheme, however, they put aside their animosity to investigate the criminal scheme. They soon learn that the illegal enterprise involves a mastermind named Nash (Eric Roberts) and a new, virtually indestructible metal that's worth a fortune. Unable to persuade Hank's former police department superiors that they're onto a huge case, the two partners must devise a way to expose the sophisticated scam and bring down Nash on their own. National Security co-stars Colm Feore, Bill Duke, Timothy Busfield, and Wayne Knight(n)</desc>

After conquering much of Europe already, Napoleon's forces have set their sights on taking Britain, so Aubrey and the crew of his ship, the HMS Surprise, take to the Pacific to intercept any attacking ships from the French fleet. When Aubrey eyes a renegade French super-frigate, the Surprise pursues, leading to an adrenaline-charged chase through the distant reaches of the sea. Edward Woodall, James D'Arcy, and Lee Ingleby also star as members of the Surprise's crew(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Terminator</title>
    <desc lang="en">Endlessly imitated, The Terminator made the reputation of cowriter/director James Cameron -- who would go on to make 1997's titanic Titanic -- and solidified the stardom of Arnold Schwarzenegger. The movie begins in a post-apocalyptic 2029, when Los Angeles has been largely reduced to rubble and is under the thumb of all-powerful ruling machines. Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), a member of the human resistance movement, is teleported back to 1984. His purpose: to rescue Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), the mother of the man who will lead the 21st-century rebels against the tyrannical machines, from being assassinated before she can give birth. Likewise thrust back to 1984 is The Terminator (Schwarzenegger), a grim, well-armed, virtually indestructable cyborg who has been programmed to eliminate Sarah Connor. After killing two "Sarah Connors" who turn out to be the wrong women, he finally aims his gunsights at the genuine article. This is the film in which Schwarzenegger declared "I'll be baaaack" -- and back he was, in "kinder and gentler" form, in the even more successful Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Sixth Sense</title>
    <desc lang="en">(1999) M Night Shyamalan's chiller about a boy who has the not-entirely-welcome ability to directly contact the dead. Bruce Willis stars as child psychologist Dr Malcolm Crowe, who is asked to help Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), who claims he can 'see dead people'. Crowe is sceptical at first, but - prompted partly by a past case he felt he badly let down - he's gradually convinced that the boy is telling the truth. Crowe believes that actively engaging with the ghostly presences could help both Sear and the spirits to find peace. Overcoming his terror, the lad finds that communicating with the deceased does, at first, seem to be beneficial. But then matters take on their own momentum, leading to one of the director's trademark plot twists... Also starring Toni Collette. M,W,S,(n)</desc>

Pretending to be a dog, Curly is delivered to the insurance doctor on a leash, but the good doc insists on performing a cerebrum decapitation on his patient and the Stooges flee on a runaway gurney. One of the busiest starlets in the Stooges stock company, Dorothy Appleby, headed the supporting cast which also included black comic Dudley Dickerson, former boxer Cy Schindell, the formidable-looking Blanche Payson and sour-faced Ned Glass (in his second of two early Stooges appearances). The latter became one of the victims of the insidious Hollywood "red scare" blacklist, but his friendship with Moe Howard led to work in such Stooge comedies as Hokus Pokus (1949) and Three Hams on Rye (1954)(n)</desc>

Grant Grant (Michael Rooker), the town's wealthiest and most powerful citizen, is taking a walk through the woods when he comes across a strange and unfamiliar life form. Grant makes the mistake of getting too close to it, and soon an otherworldly creature has taken over his body. It isn't long before Grant isn't the only one who has been attacked by the strange and slimy things, as a local girl and a handful of house pets go missing. Grant's wife, Starla (Elizabeth Banks), notices that something is very wrong with her husband around the same time that Sheriff Bill Pardy (Nathan Fillion) becomes aware of the pattern of missing people and animals, and they set out to put a stop to the alien invaders intent upon taking over Wheelsy.

    <title lang="en">Fake or Fortune</title>
    <sub-title lang="en">Freud.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Fiona Bruce and art expert Philip Mould investigate a portrait of a man wearing a black cravat painted in 1939, which the owner believes is an early work of Lucian Freud, from his time at the Central School of Art - even though Freud himself denied painting it. The team tries to uncover who the mysterious man in the painting was, whether it really was painted by Freud, and if so, why did he claim that it was not his work. The investigation digs up a complex history of feuds, rivalry and intrigue.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Actor-turned-director and producer Griffin Dunne (Practical Magic, Addicted to Love) teams up with scenarist Dirk Wittenborn for the slice-of-life ensemble drama Fierce People. As summer encroaches, 16-year-old Manhattanite Finn Earl (Anton Yelchin) would love nothing more than to trek off to South America and spend the year's sun-drenched months near the equator, embarking on thrilling adventures with his estranged archaeologist father, whom he's never met. Alas, the bonds of family rein in tight when Finn's booze- and coke-addled mother, the masseuse Liz (Diane Lane), cries out for help -- and, in the process, unwittingly gets Finn arrested. In a dramatic attempt to reverse circumstances and sort out the complications in both of their lives, Liz insists on taking custody of Finn for the summer. Both, she insists, will live in the home of one of her former massage clients, the aging billionaire Ogden C. Osborne (Donald Sutherland) -- with whom she may be amorously involved. Though Finn agrees begrudgingly at first, in time he finds the environment welcoming -- as he develops a crush on Ogden's gorgeous granddaughter (Kristen Stewart) and befriends Ogden's grandson. But when an unforeseen and shocking act of violence erupts, it estranges Finn and Liz from their posh surroundings and provides a sobering, harrowing reminder of the socioeconomic differences between the Earls and their new friends(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Scott Pilgrim vs. the World</title>
    <desc lang="en">(2010) Michael Cera (Juno, Superbad) stars in this unconventionally structured, inventive and comic paean to the alternate universe of manga and computer gaming. The movie is based on an acclaimed series of graphic novels by Canadian cartoonist Bryan Lee O'Malley, and is directed by British film-maker Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Channel 4's TV series Spaced), here making his Hollywood debut. Computer game fanatic Scott Pilgrim (Cera) is the bass player with Toronto band Sex Bob-omb. He shares his flat with his slightly-out-of-control gay friend Wallace Wells (Kieran Culkin), and courts a little controversy by dating 17-year-old schoolgirl Knives Chau (Ellen Wong). However, theirs is a fairly platonic relationship, and one he's prepared to ditch the moment he sets eyes on the woman (literally) of his dreams: Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). But if Scott wants to capture the impossibly cool New Yorker's heart, he must first defeat her former lovers, the Seven Evil Exes, in video game end-level-style combat. So he embarks on a kinetic, romantic quest, largely conducted within his own head, replete with slapstick violence, impressive effects and witty retorts(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Actor-turned-director and producer Griffin Dunne (Practical Magic, Addicted to Love) teams up with scenarist Dirk Wittenborn for the slice-of-life ensemble drama Fierce People. As summer encroaches, 16-year-old Manhattanite Finn Earl (Anton Yelchin) would love nothing more than to trek off to South America and spend the year's sun-drenched months near the equator, embarking on thrilling adventures with his estranged archaeologist father, whom he's never met. Alas, the bonds of family rein in tight when Finn's booze- and coke-addled mother, the masseuse Liz (Diane Lane), cries out for help -- and, in the process, unwittingly gets Finn arrested. In a dramatic attempt to reverse circumstances and sort out the complications in both of their lives, Liz insists on taking custody of Finn for the summer. Both, she insists, will live in the home of one of her former massage clients, the aging billionaire Ogden C. Osborne (Donald Sutherland) -- with whom she may be amorously involved. Though Finn agrees begrudgingly at first, in time he finds the environment welcoming -- as he develops a crush on Ogden's gorgeous granddaughter (Kristen Stewart) and befriends Ogden's grandson. But when an unforeseen and shocking act of violence erupts, it estranges Finn and Liz from their posh surroundings and provides a sobering, harrowing reminder of the socioeconomic differences between the Earls and their new friends(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Scott Pilgrim vs. the World</title>
    <desc lang="en">(2010) Michael Cera (Juno, Superbad) stars in this unconventionally structured, inventive and comic paean to the alternate universe of manga and computer gaming. The movie is based on an acclaimed series of graphic novels by Canadian cartoonist Bryan Lee O'Malley, and is directed by British film-maker Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Channel 4's TV series Spaced), here making his Hollywood debut. Computer game fanatic Scott Pilgrim (Cera) is the bass player with Toronto band Sex Bob-omb. He shares his flat with his slightly-out-of-control gay friend Wallace Wells (Kieran Culkin), and courts a little controversy by dating 17-year-old schoolgirl Knives Chau (Ellen Wong). However, theirs is a fairly platonic relationship, and one he's prepared to ditch the moment he sets eyes on the woman (literally) of his dreams: Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). But if Scott wants to capture the impossibly cool New Yorker's heart, he must first defeat her former lovers, the Seven Evil Exes, in video game end-level-style combat. So he embarks on a kinetic, romantic quest, largely conducted within his own head, replete with slapstick violence, impressive effects and witty retorts(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In this comedy from the producing team behind Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo, David Spade portrays Joe Dirt, a janitor with a mullet hairdo who currently works as a janitor in the rural West Coast. An on-air radio deejay (Dennis Miller) recounts his life story as a white-trash reject who, at age eight, was abandoned by his mean-spirited birth parents (Roseanne and Gary Busey) at the Grand Canyon. Years later, Joe Dirt attempts to seek out his birth parents and discover the mystery of why they dismissed him. Going from one misadventure to another, Joe's life unfolds on the radio show where his life story becomes a sensation to the locals. Joe Dirt was produced by Adam Sandler's production company, Happy Madison, and features the screen debut of rock star Kid Rock in a supporting role as Joe Dirt's rival(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Hosted--or rather, refereed--by boxing expert Max Kellerman, this lively cable-TV discussion show featured four sports columnists, each from a different part of the USA, discussing recent pro-athletic developments in a sort of electronic summit meeting. Kellerman determined how much time each of the columnists would be permitted to express his or her opinions--and he was harsh indeed, frequently limiting the discourse to ten seconds or less. At the end of the show, Kellerman would award points for the most cogent opinions and arguments, and also subtract points from contributors whom he determined had not effectively expressed themselves. The inagural episode of ESPN's Around the Horn was seen on September 30, 2002(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A woman realizes that friends can be lovers, but now has to convince the friend in question in this romantic comedy. Michael O'Neal (Dermot Mulroney) and Julianne Potter (Julia Roberts) were romantically involved in college, and after breaking up, they have managed to remain close friends. For years, Julianne and Michael have had a pledge that if both were single when they turned 28, they would get married. Shortly before her 28th birthday, Julianne is lamenting the sad state of her love life when she gets a call from Michael, who announces that he has important news. Julianne is convinced that Michael is going to ask her to marry him, and she is crestfallen when he announces that he's engaged to Kimmy Wallace (Cameron Diaz). Kimmy seems like the perfect woman for Michael; she's sweet, pretty, bright, and adores Michael, and her wealthy family is just as fond of him as she is. But now that Julianne has realized how much she loves Michael, she's not about to give him up without a fight -- and isn't afraid to fight dirty. Julianne's uneasy ally in the battle for Michael's affections is her friend and editor George Downes (Rupert Everett), a cheerfully out-of-the-closet homosexual who is not prepared when Julianne asks him to pose as her boyfriend(n)</desc>

Carlyle (Steve Howey) and his kid brother, Trip (Mike Vogel), are both racers in the rough and tumble world of supercross, a revved-up variation on motocross racing in which specially modified motorcycle negotiate specially built dirt tracks that send riders through tricky twists and turns, over rough terrain, and off high-flying jumps. Both are talented racers, but K.C. has a wilder and more reckless approach, while Trip follows a more cautious path. A more profound difference between them arises when K.C. is offered a lucrative deal to ride for a factory-sponsored team; he takes the deal, and leaves his brother behind to race on his own dime. However, when an accident takes Trip out of the running on the supercross circuit, he and K.C. set aside their differences as Trip helps coach his older brother so he can succeed in his drive to the championship. Made with the cooperation of a leading supercross race promoter, Supercross: The Movie also stars Sophia Bush and Cameron Richardson as the brothers' love interests, and Robert Carradine as a determined race coach(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Speed 2: Cruise Control</title>
    <desc lang="en">This sequel to Speed sees Sandra Bullock back and Jan de Be Bont directing but with Jason Patric taking over the Keanu Reeves role. The pair are an item and decide on a romantic cruise to the Caribbean. Unfortunately, also aboard the cruise liner are a gathering of diamond merchants, complete with their wares and arch-villain Willem Defoe, who plans to steal their merchandise. Unlike the original Speed, where the trick was that the bus would explode if it slowed down, this time, speed is of the essence - the plan is to ram the ship into dry land and, in the mayhem, escape with the loot. Bullock and Patric are perfect as the dynamic duo who save the day and the ocean-going scenario allows for more spectacular special effects than the original(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Kung Fu Hustle</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Stephen Chow made his name in this country with the deliriously wonderful Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle continues his love of comedy kung-fu films. Set in pre-revolutionary China, Chow plays Sing, a street hustler who makes the mistake of pretending to be a member of the notorious Axe gang. He becomes caught up in a war between the gang and the residents of Pig Sty Alley, which the gang want to take over. Little do they know that two of the Alley's residents are retired martial arts experts and soon the fists and feet are flying in knockabout fights that owe as much to Kill Bill (some of the wire work is done by Yuen Wo Ping, who worked on Tarantino's film) as they do to classic Hollywood silent comedies. Film fans can enjoy Chow's references to films ranging from Top Hat to The Shining while the rest can just enjoy a wildly entertaining romp. In Cantonese with English subtitles(n)</desc>

Nelson gives Bart a beating, and promises more of the same; Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) suggests that Bart try to reason with the bully, while Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) tells his son that fighting dirty is the only answer. Neither strategy seems to work, so Bart turns to Grampa Simpson (voice of Castellaneta) for advice. With the help of Herman (voice of Harry Shearer), the mildly insane owner of a store specializing in military relics, Bart and Grampa organize his fellow fourth graders into an army and orchestrate an all-out water-balloon war against Nelson and his fellow bullies.

    <title lang="en">Selena</title>
    <desc lang="en">Selena was a 23-year old Tejana singer on the verge of an international breakthrough when she was shot by the president of her own fan club. Her death spawned an outpouring of grief not seen since the death of Elvis Presley. This upbeat and tuneful biopic, executive produced by her father, Abraham Quintanilla (portrayed in the film by Edward James Olmos), is a celebration of his daughter's life, chronicling her rise to fame. The film opens with Selena (Jennifer Lopez) performing at the Houston Astrodome before a sold-out audience. The story moves backwards and begins not with Selena, but with Abraham who in the early '60s had an unsuccessful doo-wop group in Texas. As a child, Selena (Rebecca Lee Meza) showed an exceptional talent for singing. Abraham exploited that and the talents of his other two children to form a band. Much of the film focuses on the fact that Selena, though born in Texas in a Mexican-American community, had to learn Spanish as a second language. Her father insisted that she sing in the language, but it was not easy for her. To maintain the story's celebratory air, it only lightly touches on Selena's relationship with her killer -- the actual shooting occurs off-screen. The after-effects of Selena's death are also only briefly presented(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Selena</title>
    <desc lang="en">Selena was a 23-year old Tejana singer on the verge of an international breakthrough when she was shot by the president of her own fan club. Her death spawned an outpouring of grief not seen since the death of Elvis Presley. This upbeat and tuneful biopic, executive produced by her father, Abraham Quintanilla (portrayed in the film by Edward James Olmos), is a celebration of his daughter's life, chronicling her rise to fame. The film opens with Selena (Jennifer Lopez) performing at the Houston Astrodome before a sold-out audience. The story moves backwards and begins not with Selena, but with Abraham who in the early '60s had an unsuccessful doo-wop group in Texas. As a child, Selena (Rebecca Lee Meza) showed an exceptional talent for singing. Abraham exploited that and the talents of his other two children to form a band. Much of the film focuses on the fact that Selena, though born in Texas in a Mexican-American community, had to learn Spanish as a second language. Her father insisted that she sing in the language, but it was not easy for her. To maintain the story's celebratory air, it only lightly touches on Selena's relationship with her killer -- the actual shooting occurs off-screen. The after-effects of Selena's death are also only briefly presented(n)</desc>

When elderly Mrs. Xiao (Lisa Lu) dies in her sleep at home, her housekeeper and close friend Viola (Talia Shire) contacts her four adult children in hopes they'll come home to help with the funeral. Unfortunately, Mrs. Xiao didn't have many friends besides Viola, her children all have issues with her, and given her zeal to assimilate into American culture, the siblings are more than puzzled that she insisted upon a traditional Chinese funeral lasting a full seven days. Alexander (Russell Wong), a successful doctor, is still coming to terms with his overly strict mother and philandering father, and is unexpectedly reunited with his ex-wife (Kelly Hu), who he lost through his own infidelity. Elizabeth (Julia Nickson), a writer, also crosses paths with her former spouse (Adrian Hough) while she mourns both her mother and her young son. Victoria (Francoise Yip) has never been able to forgive her mom after she rejected her for marrying an African-American.

    <desc lang="en">Based on the 1997 National Book Award-nominated novel of the same name by Diane Johnson (co-writer of the script for Stanley Kubrick's The Shining), Le Divorce is a romantic comedy from director James Ivory. Revisiting the "Americans in France" theme that Ivory explored in 1998's A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries, the film stars Kate Hudson as Isabel Walker. When she receives word that her pregnant poetess sister Roxy (Naomi Watts) has been left by her philandering French husband, artist Charles-Henri de Persand (Melvil Poupaud), Isabel offers her help and moral support. As the depressive Roxy struggles with the separation proceedings -- which include the rights to ownership of a work of art that's a family heirloom -- Isabel takes a job with author Olivia Pace and has a fling with the bohemian Yves (Romain Duris). But things get complicated when the younger, more impudent sister decides instead to pursue Charles' uncle, the snooty, married diplomat Edgar (Thierry Lhermitte), and when a mysterious man (Matthew Modine) starts stalking Roxy. Eventually, the rest of the plucky Walker clan has to come to the aid of the siblings. Stockard Channing and Sam Waterston co-star(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Parenthood</title>
    <desc lang="en">This feel-good ensemble comedy tracks a quartet of suburban siblings and their families over the course of a single summer. Hardworking Gil Buckman (Steve Martin) and his stay-at-home wife, Karen (Mary Steeenburgen), have just a few months to help their oldest son, Kevin (Jasen Fisher), overcome his high-strung behavior problems before he'll be relegated to special-education classes. Gil's difficult relationship with his own father, Frank (Jason Robards), has led him to become a would-be super-dad for his three kids, so he takes his son's difficulties more than a little personally. Gil's sister, Helen (Dianne Wiest), is trying to raise a moody, adolescent son (Leaf Phoenix) and an independent-minded daughter (Martha Plimpton) with no help from her well-off ex-husband, who's more interested in his new wife and family. Gil and Helen's sister, Susan (Harley Jane Kozak), meanwhile, must participate in the too-scripted Big Life Plans of her anal-retentive husband, Nathan (Rick Moranis), whose overachiever zeal infects even their toddler daughter. When long-lost brother Larry (Tom Hulce) show up with yet another get-rich-quick scheme, he brings with him a surprise addition to the family. Screenwriters Babaloo Mandel, Lowell Ganz, and Ron Howard negotiate their varied subplots with a deftness and comedic touch that transforms this conflicted clan into a suburban everyfamily(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Based on the 1997 National Book Award-nominated novel of the same name by Diane Johnson (co-writer of the script for Stanley Kubrick's The Shining), Le Divorce is a romantic comedy from director James Ivory. Revisiting the "Americans in France" theme that Ivory explored in 1998's A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries, the film stars Kate Hudson as Isabel Walker. When she receives word that her pregnant poetess sister Roxy (Naomi Watts) has been left by her philandering French husband, artist Charles-Henri de Persand (Melvil Poupaud), Isabel offers her help and moral support. As the depressive Roxy struggles with the separation proceedings -- which include the rights to ownership of a work of art that's a family heirloom -- Isabel takes a job with author Olivia Pace and has a fling with the bohemian Yves (Romain Duris). But things get complicated when the younger, more impudent sister decides instead to pursue Charles' uncle, the snooty, married diplomat Edgar (Thierry Lhermitte), and when a mysterious man (Matthew Modine) starts stalking Roxy. Eventually, the rest of the plucky Walker clan has to come to the aid of the siblings. Stockard Channing and Sam Waterston co-star(n)</desc>

But while he's a success in business, he's a failure in life; he's vain, mean-spirited, and hasn't been able to hold onto a marriage (or even a pet dog). One day, Russ is startled to meet Rusty (Spencer Breslin), a stocky kid whom he soon realizes is himself at the age of eight, having passed through a wrinkle in time. Young Rusty doesn't seem much happier than the grown-up Russ, so the older man takes his younger self under his wing and tries to teach him how to avoid the mistakes he's made, while Rusty encourages Russ to be a more caring human being. Along the way, Russ and Rusty become friends, and realize how much they can learn from each other. Disney's The Kid also stars Jean Smart as one of Russ' clients, Lily Tomlin as his assistant, and Daniel Von Bargen as his father(n)</desc>

And, like all her friends, she dreams of having a chance to appear on it. However, this is Baltimore and it is 1962 - and Tracy's both overweight and, worse, has liberal attitudes to race relations, which don't sit comfortably with the segregationist views of the show's producer. But, could Tracy's ambitions for not only appearing on the show, but also racially integrating it, receive a fillip when she meets the son of Motormouth Maybelle, host of the monthly 'Negro Day' edition of the show? Also starring John Travolta (in drag and a fat-suit) as Tracy's mum, Christopher Walken, as her dad, and Amanda Bynes, James Marsden, Brittany Snow, Zac Efron and Elijah Kelley; plus cameos from the star of the original movie, Ricki Lake, and its director, John Waters(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Lady in the Water director M. Night Shyamalan puts PG-13 suspense on pause to tell this grim apocalyptic tale about a family fleeing a natural disaster that poses a grave threat to the whole of humanity. Philadelphia high-school science teacher Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) is discussing the disappearance of the bees with his students when the staff is summoned to the theater and briefed about a mysterious event that is currently unfolding in New York City. According to reports, citizens in the vicinity of Central Park have suddenly and inexplicably begun seizing up just before killing themselves by whatever means are at their disposal. As the phenomena begins to spread and talk of terrorism fills the airwaves, Elliot, his wife, Alma (Zooey Deschanel), their friend Julian (John Leguizamo), and his daughter, Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez), board a train bound for the presumed safety of the country. When the train screeches to a halt before arriving at its final destination, however, the frightened passengers are forced to fend for themselves as each consecutive news report paints an increasingly grim picture of the situation in more urbanized areas. Theories abound on what could be causing the unexplainable rash of suicides, but the only thing that everyone seems to agree on is that it's some kind of airborne contagion that is carried in the wind. It would appear that humankind's reign on planet Earth has come to an end, but perhaps if this small band of survivors can find a safe place to lie low until this all blows over, all hope for survival of the species might not be lost just yet(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Blair Witch Project</title>
    <desc lang="en">Combining Hi-8 video with black-and-white 16 mm film, this film presents a raw look at what can happen when college students forego common sense and enter the world of voodoo and witchcraft. Presented as a straightforward documentary, the film opens with a title card explaining that in 1994, three students went into the Maryland back woods to do a film project on the Blair Witch incidents. These kids were never seen again, and the film you are about to see is from their recovered equipment, found in the woods a year later. The entire movie documents their adventures leading up to their final minutes. The Blair Witch incident, as we initially learn from the local town elders, is an old legend about a group of witches who tortured and killed several children many years ago. Everyone in town knows the story and they're all sketchy on the details. Out in the woods and away from their parked car (and civilization), what starts as a school exercise turns into a nightmare when the three kids lose their map. Forced to spend extra days finding their way out, the kids then start to hear horrific sounds outside their tents in the pitch-black middle of night. They also find strange artifacts from (what can only be) the Blair Witch, still living in the woods. Frightened, they desperately try to find their way out of the woods, with no luck. Slowly these students start to unravel, knowing they have no way of getting out, no food, and it's getting cold. Each night they are confronted with shrieking and sounds so haunting that they are convinced someone is following them, and they quickly begin to fear for their lives. The film premiered in the midnight movie section at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Cruel Intentions</title>
    <desc lang="en">A loose adaptation of Choderlos De Laclos' 1782 novel Les Liaissons Dangereuses (which has been filmed three times before), Cruel Intentions revamps the story by moving it to the United States in the late 1990's and revising the context from royal romantic intrigue to teenage trechery among the filthy rich. Sarah Michelle Geller plays Kathryn, a beautiful but cold-hearted and manipulative young woman who enjoys making wagers with her jaded step-brother Sebastian (Ryan Phillippe). When Kathryn's boyfriend breaks off with her because he's infatuated with the less worldly Cecile (Selma Blair), Kathryn challenges Sebastian to seduce Cecile in order to ruin her new love. Sebastian reluctantly agrees, but is far more intrigued with a newer challenge -- Annette (Reese Witherspoon), the daughter of his private school's headmaster, who is intelligent, beautiful and has appeared in "Seventeen" magazine proudly announcing she intends to remain a virgin until the day she's married. Katheryn and Sebastian make a new bet: if he can bed Annette before the end of summer vacation, Katheryn will spend a debauched evening with him, but if he fails, she'll take ownership of his prized 1956 Jaguar. Supporting cast includes Swoozie Kurtz, who has gone this route before, having appeared in Stephen Frears' period adaptation of this story, Dangerous Liasons(n)</desc>

That riddle has inspired generations of historians and researchers to comb every interior and exterior inch of the pyramid, measuring distances and amassing data to arrive at a conclusion. But only recently have more definite answers come to light - answers that originate inside of the Pyramid. The documentary program National Geographic - Unlocking the Great Pyramid discusses this arresting theory(n)</desc>

The first episode of this six-part miniseries explores the revolution in personal entertainment brought on by Pac-Man, Sony Walkmans and Jane Fonda's ground-breaking workout video. Apple's Steve Wozniak helps explain how Bill Gates saw the future by selling IBM the rights to use MS-DOS software for a relatively small one-time fee, only to clean up when IBM competitors entered the market and all wanted the same software. The assassination of John Lennon heralded the end of one music era, while a bratty new kid on the block defined a new one - spelt 'MTV'. Revel in the joy of July 1981 in Britain as more than half a million people line the streets of London - and another 750 million tune-in around the globe - to see Prince Charles wed Lady Diana Spencer. And, hear from maverick businessman turned multimedia mogul Richard Branson on how he took Rock 'N Roll to new heights - literally - with the acquisition of his first 747. Sharing their first-hand stories are Darryl DMC McDaniels, Steven Tyler, Jane Fonda, Steve Wozniak, Richard Branson and Princess Diana's private secretary(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">South Africa.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Ross Kemp heads to South Africa, 20 years after apartheid was lifted, only to discover that a new set of problems exist, such as a widening gap between rich and poor. However, as he enters the deprived township of Diepsloot on the outskirts of Johannesburg, he discovers an even bigger crisis. Rape has reached epidemic proportions in the country, with statistics showing one in two women born in South Africa will be attacked in their lifetime. Meeting victims and perpetrators, he asks how attitudes to women can change, and what the government can do to curb this abhorrent crime.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Honduras.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Ross Kemp visits the Central American republic of Honduras, where he makes his way to the city of San Pedro Sula. With a rate of 169 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants last year - an average of more than three people each day - Sula has the dubious distinction of being the most dangerous city on the planet outside of a war zone. Ross discovers how armed drug gangs have taken over many parts of the country, forcing thousands to flee north on a freight train that transports migrants through Guatemala and across Mexico into the United States. But it's an arduous journey and not for the faint-hearted. Even if passengers avoid falling off the roof of the train to their deaths, they face being robbed by bandits, raped, murdered or kidnapped and sold into slavery.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Alfre Woodard and Kathy Bates star in writer/director Tyler Perry's family drama about an upper-crust family and their working-class counterparts, who discover that scandal knows no social boundaries. Charlotte Cartwright (Bates) and Alice Pratt (Woodard) may be from different sides of the tracks, yet over the years they've managed to nurture a strong and healthy friendship. That friendship is put to the ultimate test, however, when their adult children begin to act out in ways that neither parent ever saw coming. Alice's daughter Andrea (Sanaa Lathan) is married to a trusting husband named Chris (Rockmond Dunbar), but lately she's been betraying that trust by sleeping with her boss, William (Cole Hauser), who just so happens to be Charlotte's son. William is married to Jillian (KaDee Strickland), and in addition to being unfaithful, he's also scheming to take over the role of COO at his mother's lucrative construction firm. Meanwhile, Alice's other daughter, Pam (Taraji P. Henson), and her husband, Ben (Perry), a faithful family man and construction worker, have both recognized that their family has strayed from the course of righteousness, and become determined to help their loved ones back on the right path. When paternity secrets, shady double dealings, and a series of other scandals become too much for Charlotte and Alice to take, the two women set out on a cross-country trip in order to clear their heads and devise a plan for saving their families(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Bernie</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Richard Linklater teams with writer Skip Hollandsworth for this darkly comic docudrama detailing the unusual friendship between a likable Texas mortician and a wealthy but reviled widow, and the shocking crime that followed. Inspired by Hollandsworth's 1998 Texas Monthly article that first caught the attention of Linklater, Bernie takes place in Carthage, TX, where effeminate mortician Bernie Tiede (Jack Black) enjoys a reputation as a friendly and upstanding member of the community. Marjorie Nugent (Shirley MacLaine), on the other hand, couldn't hold a lower position on the local social scale. Repressed and bitter, nasty Marjorie has isolated herself from her neighbors, and as a result has been essentially shunned in her small town. The moment Bernie shows Marjorie a shred of kindness, she clings to him tightly and refuses to let go. Meanwhile, as Marjorie becomes Bernie's sugar mama and the pair becomes inseparable, the local rumor mill begins to churn. Eventually, her intense jealousy becomes too much for Bernie to take. When the caustic widow's body is discovered stuffed in her own freezer, local District Attorney Buck Davidson (Matthew McConaughey) vows that justice will be served, but he finds it difficult to build a convincing case against Bernie as the locals rally to his defense(n)</desc>

And it's one that could rescue the professional life of subway employee Walter Garber, whose glittering career has been derailed by allegations of corruption. Garber is languishing on duty as a train dispatcher when all hell breaks loose after one of the Lexington Avenue line trains is hijacked by a gang led by the supremely self-assured, calmly ruthless Ryder. Ryder issues a demand for $10m and makes it clear that he won't hesitate to kill anyone who gets in his way. Garber and NYPD hostage negotiator Lieutenant Camonetti attempt to get to grips with the crisis but, as events progress, suspicions arise as to whether there's more to the hijacking than first meets the eye. Also starring James Gandolfini as New York's mayor and Luis Guzmán as a disgruntled subway worker who has joined Ryder's gang(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The late Tony Scott's remake of the 1974 thriller, starring John Travolta and Denzel Washington. It's a day that the passengers on a New York subway train are unlikely to forget. And it's one that could rescue the professional life of subway employee Walter Garber, whose glittering career has been derailed by allegations of corruption. Garber is languishing on duty as a train dispatcher when all hell breaks loose after one of the Lexington Avenue line trains is hijacked by a gang led by the supremely self-assured, calmly ruthless Ryder. Ryder issues a demand for $10m and makes it clear that he won't hesitate to kill anyone who gets in his way. Garber and NYPD hostage negotiator Lieutenant Camonetti attempt to get to grips with the crisis but, as events progress, suspicions arise as to whether there's more to the hijacking than first meets the eye. Also starring James Gandolfini as New York's mayor and Luis Guzmán as a disgruntled subway worker who has joined Ryder's gang(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The gang from Friday and Next Friday are back in this urban comedy, in which Craig (Ice Cube) and Day-Day (Mike Epps) have finally moved out of their respective parents' homes and gotten an apartment together. However, a bogus neighborhood Santa Claus (Rickey Smiley) decides to help Craig and Day-Day share the wealth by robbing their apartment, and when he rips off their stereo, he also makes off with their rent money, which was hidden in the speaker cabinets. Desperate to make rent and have some money for Christmas presents, Craig and Day-Day land jobs at a local strip mall, where their fathers, Mr. Jones (John Witherspoon) and Uncle Elroy (Don "D.C." Curry), have gone into business together running a barbecue joint. Craig and Day-Day are installed as security guards, and while Craig tries to make time with Donna (K.D. Aubert), a saleswoman at the Pimp N' Ho's Boutique, and keep things orderly at Holy Moly's Doughnut Shop, Day-Day attempts to transform himself into a master of crime-fighting, which causes a lot more problems than it solves. Friday After Next is the first feature film from director Marcus Raboy, who previously directed music videos for Sting, Li'l Kim, Staind, and Friday After Next star Ice Cube(n)</desc>

It's the mid-1970s and Southern Californian teen Joan Larkin has changed her name to Joan Jett. Along with her new dark, edgy identity comes a nascent desire: to create an all-girl rock band. Joan and her aggressive manager Kim Fowley stumble across the perfect face for the band: the 15-year-old blonde bombshell Cherie Curie. The two girls become close, with Cherie's sweet melodies slickly harmonising with Joan's electrifying guitar solos to great effect. They name themselves The Runaways and, after recruiting a lead guitarist and a bass player, are soon signed to Mercury Records, plunging them into the deep end of 70s rock excess. The success of their first album is massive. But, after a concert in Japan, the rest of the band discover magazines that feature only pictures of Cherie inside them - and are furious that they've been left out. Cherie begins to crumble under the pressures of being the face of the band, and starts to find solace in alcohol and drugs. As the band's stability disintegrates, can the girls rediscover the fun, runaway rock and roll lifestyle they sought?(n)</desc>

Meanwhile, former high school beauty queen Michelle (Catherine Keener), the eldest of the three, lives a life of quiet desperation with two kids and a husband who refuses to understand her artistic yearnings. On the other hand, Elizabeth (Emily Mortimer), an actress whose career is about to take off, is in a loving marriage with James LeGros, though she remains insecure about her talents and abilities. Only the youngest daughter, eight-year-old African-American adoptee Annie (Raven Goodwin), seems likely to come out of the family without the neurosis or self-absorption of her elder siblings.

    <title lang="en">Event Horizon</title>
    <desc lang="en">In this sci-fi/horror scarefest, Dr. William Weir (Sam Neill) is a scientist who has designed a spacecraft called Event Horizon which will explore the outer reaches of space past the planet Neptune; the ship employs a special transport mechanism that, in effect, creates a black hole that the ship can pass through, allowing it to travel tremendous distances in a few seconds. The Event Horizon mysteriously disappears in the midst of a mission with no trace of either the ship or its crew, but it reappears in Neptune's orbit after a seven year absence and it's sending out a distress signal. The spaceship Lewis and Clark, and Dr. Weir, are sent to investigate; the crew -- Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne), pilot Smith (Sean Pertwee), engineer Justin (Jack Noseworthy), navigator Starck (Joely Richardson), physician D.J. (Jason Isaacs), and emergency technicians Peters (Kathleen Quinlan) and Cooper (Richard T. Jones) -- are already tired and unenthusiastic about this assignment, and somewhat confused by Weir's reports. The crew of the Lewis and Clark are convinced that Weir is not telling them something, and when they discover the Event Horizon, they find that things are not what they seem, and an evil presence has taken over the ship. Incidentally, the term "event horizon" describes the outer boundaries of a black hole(n)</desc>

Ned's hard work starts to pay off, however, when he ventures deep into the New Mexico desert, where an eccentric billionaire (Sam Elliott) and a brilliant physicist (Jimmi Simpson) have hatched a plan to recreate the Big Bang. Now, with the cops hot on his tail and a potentially catastrophic experiment unfolding right beneath his feet, Ned races to find the girl and recover the diamonds before the world comes to an end(n)</desc>

Now, as Sheriff Riley's rebellious teenage son (Shad Collins) departs for a relaxing lakeside camping trip, the desperate father realizes the danger that lies beneath the surface and races to confront a prehistoric predator that won't stop until it's consumed every last local(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Immaturity and poor sportsmanship once again find their firmly established place in children's athletics (at least among the adults) in this sports comedy. Phil Weston (Will Ferrell) is a tightly wound suburban father who had a competitive streak worn into him by his father, Buck (Robert Duvall), who never seemed to feel that his son measured up. When Phil's son joins a Little League soccer team, Phil signs on as coach, only to learn that Buck -- who also has a ten-year-old son these days -- will be coaching a team in the same league. Determined to show his father he can do the job, Phil impresses upon his young charges that winning is the only important thing, and soon gains a few enemies as he humiliates not only the kids on his own team, but their opponents as well. Directed by Jesse Dylan, Kicking &amp; Screaming also features Kate Walsh and legendary football coach Mike Ditka. The screenplay was authored by Steve Rudnick and Leo Benvenuti (The Santa Clause) prior to the latter's death in 2000(n)</desc>
