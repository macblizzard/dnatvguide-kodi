    <desc lang="en">Gordon Ramsay revisits three of the most difficult cases he has taken on since the series began. First, he returns to Cafe Hon in Baltimore, Maryland, where owner Denise Whiting was trapped in a nasty battle with the community and had threatened the locals with lawsuits. Next, the chef goes back to Chiarella's in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. When he first visited owners Tommy and Dina DeFino, the business was struggling so badly that Tommy had completely lost his confidence and wife Dina had lost her patience. On his final stop, Gordon travels to Leone's in Montclair, New Jersey, where Rose Leone was depending on her lazy son Michael to run the restaurant.(n)</desc>

However, gangster Eddie Kim has secreted crates of venomous serpents in the cargo hold and when they're released, all hell breaks loose. The film earned a reputation for the inclusion of plot lines from blogging fans, including one now infamous line. Despite the novel approach to its production, David R Ellis's film is surprisingly well-acted and tense, with both Julianna Margulies as flight attendant Claire Miller and David Koechner as co-pilot Rick receiving a fair share of the cracking dialogue(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Inception</title>
    <desc lang="en">Visionary filmmaker Christopher Nolan (Memento, The Dark Knight) writes and directs this psychological sci-fi action film about a thief who possesses the power to enter into the dreams of others. Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) doesn't steal things, he steals ideas. By projecting himself deep into the subconscious of his targets, he can glean information that even the best computer hackers can't get to. In the world of corporate espionage, Cobb is the ultimate weapon. But even weapons have their weakness, and when Cobb loses everything, he's forced to embark on one final mission in a desperate quest for redemption. This time, Cobb won't be harvesting an idea, but sowing one. Should he and his team of specialists succeed, they will have discovered a new frontier in the art of psychic espionage. They've planned everything to perfection, and they have all the tools to get the job done. Their mission is complicated, however, by the sudden appearance of a malevolent foe that seems to know exactly what they're up to, and precisely how to stop them(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Chelsea v Manchester United.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Chelsea v Manchester United (Kick-off 7.45pm). Gary Lineker presents coverage of the sixth-round tie, which takes place at Stamford Bridge, as the two Premier League giants fight for a semi-final place. Antonio Conte's side are flying high in the league at present, and are firm favourites to lift the trophy at the end of the season. Jose Mourinho's Red Devils are the current holders of the FA Cup and are still mathematically in the domestic title hunt, but the Portuguese will see this competition as a far more likely opportunity of silverware, having already clinched the EFL Cup with a 3-2 victory over Southampton at Wembley. The Blues ran out 4-0 winners the last time the sides met in the league back in October, thanks to goals from Pedro, Gary Cahill, Eden Hazard and N'Golo Kante.(n)</desc>

At the age of 20, the woman who would become known as `the Divine Miss M' went from working in a pineapple-canning factory in Honolulu, Hawaii, to a role in the 1967 Broadway hit Fiddler on the Roof, and has never looked back. She recalls those early days, as well as the nightclubs and bathhouses of the 1970s, and how she finally made it to the top of the film industry, the combination of a raucous wit and soulful voice making her an outrageous but captivating all-round entertainer.(n)</desc>

To understand these receptors, Michael examines a cream produced from the rich milk of water buffalo that has a similar effect. The duo also explore the hold that caffeinated drinks can have and take on some of the hottest chillies on the planet to show what the burn does to the brain.(n)</desc>

Billy Bob Thornton stars as Georgia prison guard Hank Grotowski, a hard-drinking racist ex-cop whose father, Buck (Peter Boyle), is dying of emphysema and whose son, Sonny (Heath Ledger), works the execution detail at the prison's death row. When Sonny commits suicide, Hank is devastated and quits his job, spiraling into a deep depression until, one night, he comes to the aid of Leticia (Halle Berry), a beautiful African-American woman whose son, Tyrell (Coronji Calhoun), has been hit by a car. When Tyrell dies, Leticia and Hank find themselves to be unexpected soul mates linked together by tragic grief. It's not long before Hank discovers that Leticia is the widow of Lawrence Musgrove (Sean Combs), the man whose execution by electric chair he and his late son helped to orchestrate. Monster's Ball (2001) is based on a screenplay by actors Milo Addica and Will Rokos, who spent five years developing their script into a feature. Their title refers to the name of an English tradition requiring jailers to throw a party for a condemned man on the night before his death(n)</desc>

Hitler decided to stake his last reserves on a major counter-offensive in the Ardennes region of Belgium, leading to what became known as the Battle of the Bulge. Meanwhile, Soviet troops discovered the first death camps and evidence emerged of the Nazi programme to exterminate the Jewish people.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In this taut jungle melodrama it is difficult to tell the hunters from the hunted. It is set within the heavy Panamanian jungles and centers upon two Marine Corps marksmen who have been assigned to assassinate a Colombian drug czar. Tom Beckett is the senior corpsman who has killed over 70 people, none of them accidentally. He enjoys his job and prides himself on his care to never hit the innocent. His former partner was Corporal Papich who was unfortunately killed on the last mission. Papich's replacement is the eager-beaver rookie Richard Miller who has won an Olympic Medal for his shooting. Although not a military man, Miller has connections with the National Security Council that assigns these missions and is now eager to prove himself, especially after the Council placed the novice in charge of the mission and considers the more experienced Beckett expendable. Naturally there is tension between the two disparate killers, especially after Miller demonstrates his ineptitude under pressure. Before they can kill the drug lord, they must first ingratiate themselves with the local Indians. To do so, the loner Beckett agrees to deviate from his orders and murder the cruel ex-CIA operative El Cirujano who has been torturing the locals. Unfortunately, Miller makes the shot and botches the job. The locals then refuse to help and tension between the men escalates. When El Cirujano captures Beckett, Miller must somehow get his act together, save Beckett, and fulfil his mission(n)</desc>

He asks her to marry him, and she agrees, though she is unaware that serious financial troubles have prompted him to fund a drug deal with a shady but established middle man named Westray (Brad Pitt), that could bring in millions. Part of the counselor's financial troubles stem from the fact that he's investing in a club being opened by his best friend Reiner (Javier Bardem), a hedonist and occasional client who has attained his wealth by any means necessary, and likes to keep his wife, Malkina (Cameron Diaz) covered in all the accoutrements the wealthy enjoy. However, when the drug deal starts to go wrong, the counselor finds himself unprepared to deal with the fallout, and soon he's trying to protect his bride-to-be as well as himself from the wrath of a drug cartel that has no qualms about exacting revenge(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Old Man and the C Student. Lisa Simpson (voice of Yeardley Smith) sends a letter to the International Olympic Committee suggesting they consider Springfield as a site for the upcoming world games, and to the surprise of everyone the IOC thinks it's a good idea. However, while the city is giddy over the influx of money and media attention the Olympics will draw, Bart manages to spoil everything by presenting some wildly insulting standup comedy at a press event for the visiting IOC representatives. The committee changes their mind at the last minute, and Bart and his classmates are ordered to perform community service as punishment for driving away the Olympics. Bart is assigned to help out at the Springfield Retirement Castle, where his grandfather Abe Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) is a resident. Bart tries to liven up the humdrum lives of the senior citizens, and arranges for them to take an afternoon cruise on a boat. However, Bart forgets little things like medication for the passengers or proper safety, and his attempt to show the seniors a good time may prove deadly after their ship collides with a yacht owned by C. Montgomery Burns (Voice of Harry Shearer). Meanwhile, Homer (also voiced by Castellaneta) has to find a way to get rid of thousands of springs he bought to make souvenir mascot toys for the Springfield Olympics. "The Old Man and the "C" Student first aired on April 25, 1999, and features a voice cameo from fitness guru Jack La Lanne as himself, who demonstrates his real-life trick of towing a boat using a chain in his teeth(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Interview With the Vampire</title>
    <desc lang="en">Anne Rice's best-selling romantic horror tale about the origins of a centuries-old vampire inspired this popular, atmospheric chiller. One of director Neil Jordan's major Hollywood productions, the film stays close to its source material, retaining the frame of a young reporter (Christian Slater) interviewing a man who claims to be a 200-year-old vampire. The man, Louis (Brad Pitt), shares his story, beginning in 18th-century New Orleans with his first encounters with the charismatic and decadent vampire Lestat (Tom Cruise). Lestat converts Louis to blood-sucking and immortality, but Louis fails to adopt Lestat's cavalier attitude, instead tormenting himself with guilt over his new nature. The two vampires remain deeply, if reluctantly, connected over the years, while becoming intimately involved with others of their kind, including Claudia (Kirsten Dunst), a mature immortal in a young child's body. Fans of the novel raised numerous objections, particularly after Rice initially spoke out against the casting of Cruise as Lestat; further casting difficulties followed the death of River Phoenix, whose role as the interviewer was assumed by Christian Slater. Rice later recanted her objections, and the combination of thrills and gothic romance proved popular with audiences(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Interview With the Vampire</title>
    <desc lang="en">Anne Rice's best-selling romantic horror tale about the origins of a centuries-old vampire inspired this popular, atmospheric chiller. One of director Neil Jordan's major Hollywood productions, the film stays close to its source material, retaining the frame of a young reporter (Christian Slater) interviewing a man who claims to be a 200-year-old vampire. The man, Louis (Brad Pitt), shares his story, beginning in 18th-century New Orleans with his first encounters with the charismatic and decadent vampire Lestat (Tom Cruise). Lestat converts Louis to blood-sucking and immortality, but Louis fails to adopt Lestat's cavalier attitude, instead tormenting himself with guilt over his new nature. The two vampires remain deeply, if reluctantly, connected over the years, while becoming intimately involved with others of their kind, including Claudia (Kirsten Dunst), a mature immortal in a young child's body. Fans of the novel raised numerous objections, particularly after Rice initially spoke out against the casting of Cruise as Lestat; further casting difficulties followed the death of River Phoenix, whose role as the interviewer was assumed by Christian Slater. Rice later recanted her objections, and the combination of thrills and gothic romance proved popular with audiences(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In September 2004, comedian Dave Chappelle took a break from his immensely successful Comedy Central show to stage a free, unpublicized, all-star hip-hop concert in the Clinton Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn, NY. Inviting fans over the Internet, on the street, and even in his family's hometown of Yellow Springs, OH, Chappelle asked filmmaker Michel Gondry to document the event from its inception on through to the performances themselves. The result is Dave Chappelle's Block Party, a concert film that provides not only a sampling of the music on display that September, but also an intimate look at the comedian himself. Gondry's cameras tag along with Chappelle as he visits Ohio, recruits a university marching band to play at the show, and surveys the opinions of Clinton Hill on the show that's about to take place. Along the way, we're introduced to some the comedian's favorite acts, in rehearsals and on-stage: Dead Prez, Jill Scott, Mos Def, the Roots, Erykah Badu, Kanye West, and the surprise reuniting of the Fugees(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Jeffrey Blitz's seriocomedy Rocket Science proves that many a handicap can be overcome, no matter how daunting the obstacle at hand may initially seem. Newcomer Reece Thompson plays Hal Hefner, a 15-year-old high-school student with a minor yet socially alienating (and painful) disability: he stutters uncontrollably. Determined to work through the problem, Hal opts for an extreme route -- he joins the school debating team, which sends him on a headfirst plunge into breakneck speech competitions -- and offers a much-needed boost toward correcting the problem. Blitz, like his onscreen alter ego, struggled with a stammer as a young man -- a disability he eventually surmounted -- which imparted him with a lifelong interest in speech and storytelling(n)</desc>

Josh has grown accustomed to the Byzantine world of temporary labor, particularly the bossy secretaries and chilly co-workers, but Josh manages to impress his latest employers enough that they offer to make him a permanent, full-time employee. While a fellow temp who worked for the same company warns Josh that taking the job would be a mistake, Josh takes the plunge anyway, and soon discovers that his fellow employees now embrace him as one of their own. He also discovers that Bob Shelby (Warren Keith), his new boss, is more than a little crazy, and when Bob gives Josh an assignment to mail a series of important letters, John finds that he's suddenly incapable of doing this seemingly simple task. Instead, Josh spends his days working on his book (on company time and on a company computer), with his fellow office drones offering emphatic encouragement. Josh Kornbluth adapted Haiku Tunnel (with the help of John Bellucci and Jacob Kornbluth) from a semi-improvised one-man show Kornbluth created with David Ford; the Kornbluth brothers also directed the film(n)</desc>

Defying his surprise death sentence, Woodroof set out to procure any and all non-toxic alternative HIV treatments available, and established a "buyers club" to provide the treatments to others afflicted with the disease. But that mission quickly made him a target for both the U.S. medical establishment and the pharmaceutical industry, both of which resented his defiance of government sanctions, and joined forces to shut down his operation by any means necessary(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Following their television series Home Improvement and the features The Santa Clause (1994) and Jungle 2 Jungle (1997), the actor/director team of Tim Allen and John Pasquin collaborate once again on this high-concept comedy. Allen stars as Joe Scheffer, a nice guy video specialist for a Minneapolis pharmaceutical company who's plodding through both his thankless job and an unhappy divorce from his ex-wife Callie (Kelly Lynch). When Joe brings his daughter Natalie (Hayden Panettiere) to the office with him on Take Our Kids to Work Day, he's humiliated in a spat with company bully Mark McKinney (Patrick Warburton) over a parking space. It's the last straw for the mild-mannered Joe, who challenges McKinney to a rematch, hires a has-been action movie star (Jim Belushi) to instruct him in martial arts, and pays a stylist to make over his wardrobe and hair. As Joe's image improves and the big day approaches, he finds his new self-respecting stance has positive effects in both the workplace, as he lands a long-overdue promotion, and in his romantic life, as both Callie and a cute "wellness coordinator" (Julie Bowen) start warming up to him. The levelheaded Natalie, however, seems to prefer the previously non-confrontational dad she already loved. Joe Somebody (2001) is the feature debut of screenwriter John Scott Shepherd, who actually worked as a corporate filmmaker in Minneapolis(n)</desc>

Next, he journeys to Texas, where he encounters Rhonda Glover, a former beauty queen and rodeo star who gunned down her lover in cold blood after their relationship spiralled into drug-fuelled obsession and paranoia.(n)</desc>

A master-of-disguise octopus camouflages itself as a rock, a plant, and even as a snake, to capture prey or elude pursuit. A lizard literally walks on water, while a fish walks on dry land to find a mate, and that's just for starters!(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Back in 1983, 16-year-old Amy Taskerland was murdered on the night of the school disco. More than 30 years later, the unearthing of a time capsule and the discovery of her voice on a mix tape inside prompts Miller and co to delve back into the case, starting by interviewing Amy's best friend Harriet and her former teacher Mr Hines. The recording features a strange mix of music and poetry, including words from a speech written in secret for the Queen for broadcast in the event of a nuclear war. But how did Amy get a copy of it, and was its secret nature the reason she was killed? Elsewhere, Miller enjoys her first romance since her divorce, while Gerry goes on his future son-in-law's stag night. Amy Nuttall (Emmerdale, Downton Abbey) and Jack Shepherd (Wycliffe) guest star.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Town That Caught Tourette's</title>
    <desc lang="en">In October 2011, a handful of students from the same high school in the small town of Le Roy, New York, developed the symptoms of Tourette's syndrome - facial twitching, violent limb gestures and uncontrollable verbal outbursts. The epidemic strangely seemed to affect only teenage girls and the eventual diagnosis was one of mass hysteria, where physical tics spread among vulnerable people in close proximity. This documentary features interviews with those at the heart of this outbreak, including the girls who have recovered, as well as those who are still suffering. Using archive footage, it also tells how this bizarre situation began and how the individuals and their families not only dealt with the disorder, but how they reacted to the media frenzy that came to surround them.(n)</desc>

It's all greasy spoons and low-rent ethnic eateries in the world of seasoned big-city health inspector Larry (Larry the Cable Guy), and that's just the way he likes it. After begrudgingly accepting the task of training by-the-books trainee Amy (Iris Bahr), Larry lands the biggest case of his career when a group of high-class diners fall ill following a particularly pricey meal. Though the gruff but lovable health inspector soon loses his job as a direct result of his questionable manners, he soon wins the heart of a shy waitress while attempting to go undercover to crack the case and ensure that the conspirators who engineered the poisonous plan are brought to justice(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Traffic</title>
    <desc lang="en">Described by director Steven Soderbergh as "Nashville meets The French Connection," this multi-character drama explores the effects of international drug trafficking on all fronts: from their source, to the U.S. border, to the federal government, to the private lives of users. Based upon a miniseries originally aired on Britain's Channel 4, Traffic divides its time among three main storylines and almost a dozen locales. The first and primary plot thread, set in Ohio and Washington, D.C., concerns freshly-appointed drug czar Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas), whose enthusiasm for his new prestige position is quickly offset when he realizes his 16-year-old daughter Caroline (Erika Christensen) is graduating from recreational drug use to habitual abuse -- a secret that his wife, Barbara (Amy Irving), has kept from him. South of the border, Mexican cop Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro) attempts to wage his own war on drugs, heading off a cocaine shipment in the middle of the desert with his less-than-virtuous partner Manolo Sanchez (Jacob Vargas). Surrounded by corruption, Javier approaches the drug war with an attitude of patience and compromise, which opens him up to investigation from General Arturo Salazar (Tomas Milian), the country's dubious drug-enforcement liaison to the U.S. Meanwhile, San Diego drug kingpin Carlos Alaya (Steven Bauer) is caught in a sting operation spearheaded by DEA agents Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Luis Guzman), leaving behind his very pregnant and very oblivious wife, Helena (Catharine Zeta-Jones). At the behest of Carlos' lawyer and shady confidante, Arnie Metzger (Dennis Quaid), Helena decides to carry on the family business -- with tragic consequences. Adapted by Rules of Engagement scribe Stephen Gaghan, Traffic marked Soderbergh's second major release in 2000 after the critical and box-office success of Erin Brockovich, as well as his second feature as cinematographer (credited under the pseudonym Peter Andrews). A favorite with various guild and critics' awards, Traffic won four Academy Awards in 2001, including statues for Best Supporting Actor (Del Toro) and Best Adapted Screenplay (Gaghan), and surprise wins for Steven Mirrone's editing and Soderbergh's direction(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Traffic</title>
    <desc lang="en">Described by director Steven Soderbergh as "Nashville meets The French Connection," this multi-character drama explores the effects of international drug trafficking on all fronts: from their source, to the U.S. border, to the federal government, to the private lives of users. Based upon a miniseries originally aired on Britain's Channel 4, Traffic divides its time among three main storylines and almost a dozen locales. The first and primary plot thread, set in Ohio and Washington, D.C., concerns freshly-appointed drug czar Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas), whose enthusiasm for his new prestige position is quickly offset when he realizes his 16-year-old daughter Caroline (Erika Christensen) is graduating from recreational drug use to habitual abuse -- a secret that his wife, Barbara (Amy Irving), has kept from him. South of the border, Mexican cop Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro) attempts to wage his own war on drugs, heading off a cocaine shipment in the middle of the desert with his less-than-virtuous partner Manolo Sanchez (Jacob Vargas). Surrounded by corruption, Javier approaches the drug war with an attitude of patience and compromise, which opens him up to investigation from General Arturo Salazar (Tomas Milian), the country's dubious drug-enforcement liaison to the U.S. Meanwhile, San Diego drug kingpin Carlos Alaya (Steven Bauer) is caught in a sting operation spearheaded by DEA agents Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Luis Guzman), leaving behind his very pregnant and very oblivious wife, Helena (Catharine Zeta-Jones). At the behest of Carlos' lawyer and shady confidante, Arnie Metzger (Dennis Quaid), Helena decides to carry on the family business -- with tragic consequences. Adapted by Rules of Engagement scribe Stephen Gaghan, Traffic marked Soderbergh's second major release in 2000 after the critical and box-office success of Erin Brockovich, as well as his second feature as cinematographer (credited under the pseudonym Peter Andrews). A favorite with various guild and critics' awards, Traffic won four Academy Awards in 2001, including statues for Best Supporting Actor (Del Toro) and Best Adapted Screenplay (Gaghan), and surprise wins for Steven Mirrone's editing and Soderbergh's direction(n)</desc>

However, Johnny's family refuses to give her his address, so she leaves for Birmingham with only a sketchy idea of his whereabouts. Shortly after arriving, Felicia encounters Joseph Ambrose Hilditch (Bob Hoskins), the meticulous manager of a catering concern. She needs a place to stay and he recommends a good bed-and-breakfast. They soon become friendly, but Hilditch is more than just a mildly eccentric middle-aged man with a taste for French cuisine: he's had a long history of using and abusing homeless women, and Felicia looks like she's doomed to be the next victim. Based on a novel by William Trevor, Felicia's Journey was shown in competition at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival(n)</desc>

The stories of legend are true, and the magical relics owned by such celebrated figures as Cinderella really exist. The malevolent force known as The Krugen knows well that the owner of these objects will reap ultimate power, because by obtaining the magical mirror once owned by the Evil Queen who tormented Snow White, they were able to herald the arrival of the Dark Ages. Centuries later, former Hunter Mason has become a loyal servant of The Krugen. He knows that once he locates all of the pieces of the mirror no one will be able to challenge his evil reign. But Jordyn and Carter Flynn hail from a long line of Hunters, and they've got just the skills to prevent Mason from achieving his diabolical plan. When Jordyn and Carter learn that their parents have gone missing during an important mission, they vow to track them down, and head off a disaster that could alter the entire course of history(n)</desc>

Van Wilder's former assistant has learned the ways of the master, and now he's prepared to share his newfound knowledge with the stuffy students of the school known more for academia than rowdy mischief.

As the evening's questionable activities take a decidedly sordid slant and the raptorial Jeff appears poised to strike, a sudden turn of events finds that his apparent victim has had a plan of her own from the very beginning(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Hurt Locker</title>
    <desc lang="en">Kathryn Bigelow's multiple-Oscar-winning film is a compelling fact-based, Iraq-set bomb disposal drama, scripted by journalist Mark Boal, drawing on his experiences while embedded with a United States Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal team in 2004. The focus is on the complex characters making up Bravo Company, who disable and destroy improvised explosive devices. The days are ticking down to the end of the bomb squad's tour, but their role puts the team in harm's way around the clock. And it doesn't help that one of the team is addicted to risk taking and pays scant attention to standard procedure, putting other lives in danger, as well as his own.

    <title lang="en">The Hurt Locker</title>
    <desc lang="en">Kathryn Bigelow's multiple-Oscar-winning film is a compelling fact-based, Iraq-set bomb disposal drama, scripted by journalist Mark Boal, drawing on his experiences while embedded with a United States Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal team in 2004. The focus is on the complex characters making up Bravo Company, who disable and destroy improvised explosive devices. The days are ticking down to the end of the bomb squad's tour, but their role puts the team in harm's way around the clock. And it doesn't help that one of the team is addicted to risk taking and pays scant attention to standard procedure, putting other lives in danger, as well as his own. The Hurt Locker provides a tense glimpse into the lives of these extraordinary men, and also probes the various psychologies of people whose job could kill them at any moment, as well as - briefly - exploring how they cope once away from their adrenaline-soaked vocation.

    <title lang="en">The Grudge</title>
    <desc lang="en">This American remake of director Takashi Shimizu's popular Japanese movie franchise The Grudge puts Buffy the Vampire Slayer alumna Sarah Michelle Gellar back into the line of supernatural fire. When Karen (Gellar), an American student working with a Japanese health center for college credit, comes across a mysterious curse, she quickly finds herself embroiled in a fight for her own sanity, and, ultimately, her very survival. Known as a "grudge," the curse was born inside of a house after its inhabitants died while consumed by rage -- according to legend, the curse touches all who come into contact with it, and will torment those unlucky individuals until they, too, become part of the grudge . Each time the curse finds a new victim, it is, in a sense, reborn, and will continue on its path unless Karen can free herself from its control over her. This version of The Grudge is also directed by Shimizu, and features Jason Behr, Clea DuVall, Kadee Strickland, William Mapother, and Bill Pullman in supporting roles(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">In Her Shoes</title>
    <desc lang="en">Two sisters must set aside their differences to share a surprising discovery in this drama. Maggie Feller (Cameron Diaz) and her sister, Rose (Toni Collette), are two siblings who have practically nothing in common beyond sharing the same shoe size. Maggie is beautiful but was never good in school due to dyslexia, and over the years has learned to use her looks and her charm to get what she wants, at the expense of what others think of her. Rose, on the other hand, is a successful lawyer but has never had much luck in love and has serious self-respect issues. When Maggie finds herself evicted from her apartment, she turns up on Rose's doorstep; Rose grudgingly takes in her sister, but a few uncomfortable weeks together end when Maggie seduces Rose's boyfriend. Maggie once again finds herself on the street until she makes a surprising discovery -- while she and her sister had long believed that their grandmother Ella (Shirley MacLaine) was dead, it turns out she's alive and well and living in Florida. Based on the best-selling novel by Jennifer Weiner, In Her Shoes marked a change of pace for director Curtis Hanson, best known for his taste in hard-edged dramas such as 8 Mile and L.A. Confidential(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Boys Don't Cry</title>
    <desc lang="en">Based on a true story, this drama was adapted from the life of Brandon Teena, born Teena Brandon, a woman who chose to live her life as a man and suffered tragic consequences as a result. In 1993, 20-year-old Brandon (Hilary Swank) leaves Lincoln, Nebraska for the nearby community of Falls City, where she sports a crew cut, favors jeans and boots, and is regarded as a man by most of the people in town. While Brandon's friend Lonny (Matt McGrath) warns her that sexual outsiders aren't looked upon kindly in Falls City, she develops a reputation for being something of a ladies' man, and is soon living with a single mother named Candace (Alicia Goranson). But when Brandon meets teenage Lana (Chloe Sevigny), the two become romantically involved almost immediately. Brandon makes friends with Lana's mother (Jeanetta Arnette) and a burly ex-con named John (Peter Sarsgaard). John and his buddy Tom (Brendan Sexton) run with a rough group of men who like to drink and carouse, and they accept Brandon as one of their own. However, when Brandon ends up in jail on a traffic violation, her secret comes out, and, while Lana stands by Brandon's side, John and Tom feel betrayed -- and their anger soon boils over into violence. A distinguished feature debut for director Kimberly Peirce, Boys Don't Cry was enthusiastically received in its showings at 1999 film festivals in Venice, Toronto, and New York(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Perfect Holiday</title>
    <desc lang="en">Gabrielle Union, Morris Chestnut, Queen Latifah, and Terrence Howard star in a film concerning a young girl who implores a department-store Santa to find a new husband for her divorced mother for Christmas. Single mother of three Nancy (Union) has been putting the needs of her three children ahead of her own for as far back as she can remember, and lately her youngest daughter, Emily (Khail Bryant), has become acutely aware of her mother's palpable sadness. As Christmas draws near, Nancy takes her kids to the mall for a cheerful visit with jolly old Saint Nick. When it comes time for Emily's turn to sit on Santa's lap and make her Christmas wish, she selflessly remembers her mother's recent comment that a compliment from a man would be the best gift of all. Determined to make her mother happy again even if it means sacrificing her own wish, Emily relays the message to Santa (Chestnut), not realizing that the man beneath the beard is actually an office-supply salesman and ambitious singer/songwriter named Benjamin. Recognizing the daughter's love for her mother and sensing something truly special in Nancy, Benjamin cheerfully obliges the young girl, setting into motion a series of events that promise to make this the most memorable holiday in quite some time. Lance Rivera directs a film produced by Shakim Compere and Latifah through Flavor Unit Entertainment(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Time Machine</title>
    <desc lang="en">The classic science fiction novel by H.G. Wells becomes this big-budget adventure directed by the author's great-grandson Simon Wells. Guy Pearce stars as Alexander Hartdegen, a scientist, professor, and inventor in 1895 New York City who believes that time travel is possible. The sudden and unexpected death of his fiancée spurs Alexander to build a time machine, which he hopes to use in an effort to change the past. When he is unable to change the past, Alexander hurls himself more than 800,000 years into the future, seeking answers about the nature of time, but instead encountering a dystopian world where humanity has divided up into two races, the peaceful Eloi and the subterranean Morlocks. Befriending the beautiful Eloi woman Mara (pop singer Samantha Mumba), Alexander must set out to save her from the underground world of the Morlocks when she is captured by them. Along the way, he is aided by Vox (Orlando Jones), a bio-mechanical being from the 21st century. Ultimately, Alexander makes a shocking discovery about the true nature of the Eloi and Morlocks and decides that the only way to change the future is to alter the present. Due to exhaustion, director Wells was briefly replaced during the last few weeks of production by Gore Verbinski, director of The Mexican (2001). The Time Machine co-stars Jeremy Irons and Mark Addy(n)</desc>

Though he shocked his teammates by quitting in the middle of the game, certain that his Hall of Fame position was in the bag, complications arise when he discovers that three of his hits during his ten-year career had been disqualified. Known as Mr. 3000, the 47-year-old, out-of-shape ball player returns to the game intending to stay only as long as it takes to get the hits he needs, but something unexpected happens along the way -- he rediscovers his love for the game, and begins to serve as a mentor to one of the younger players.
