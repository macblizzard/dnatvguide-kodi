    <desc lang="en">Carol Fuchs adapts writer/director Sandra Nettelbeck's screenplay for the 2001 romantic drama Mostly Martha for this Scott Hicks directed remake starring Catherine Zeta-Jones, Aaron Eckhart, and Patricia Clarkson. Kate Armstrong (Jones) is the master chef who is equally intense both in and out of the kitchen. Though Kate's "Type A" personality serves her well when whipping up meals in the trendy Manhattan eatery where she has made a name for herself, it threatens to sink her when she is named as the guardian of her nine-year-old niece Zoe (Little Miss Sunshine's Abigail Breslin). To complicate matters, an impetuous new sous chef named Nick Palmer (Eckhart) has recently joined the kitchen staff and his freewheeling personality seems to stand in direct opposition to Kate's unwavering perfectionism. Yet, despite the fact that they couldn't be more different on the surface, there's no denying the strong attraction between Kate and Nick. As the rivalry between the competitive cooks gradually gives way to romance, the lessons learned by compromising in the kitchen reveal to Kate the importance of learning to openly express herself in order to truly connect with Zoe and find romance with the good-natured Nick(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Jimmy Kimmel Live</title>
    <desc lang="en">Chubby, cheeky comedian Jimmy Kimmel, late of cable TV's raunchy The Man Show, was launched in his own late-night ABC talk-variety series on January 26, 2003. Cashing in on Kimmel's patented profane irreverence, the series -- designed to go head-to-head with NBC's Late Night With Conan O'Brien and CBS' The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborne -- pushed the envelope of propriety and good taste farther than ABC had ever gone before. On the opening episode alone, a woozy George Clooney passed out booze to the studio audience, Snoop Dogg flipped a bird at the camera, and a spectator threw up, a spectacle lovingly described by the host. This prompted ABC to close the "open" bar that was the centerpiece of the first episode, and to tightly monitor all future programs, especially during the impromptu stunts perpetrated by the production crew on innocent bystanders outside the studio. Even without the threat of censorship from its parent network, Jimmy Kimmel Live did not appear to be long for this world, its already meager ratings diminishing with each new episode(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Black Hawk Down</title>
    <desc lang="en">A quickly forgotten chapter in United States military history is relived in this harrowing war drama from director Ridley Scott, based on a series of Philadelphia Inquirer articles and subsequent book by reporter Mark Bowden. On October 3rd, 1993, an elite team of more than 100 Delta Force soldiers and Army Rangers, part of a larger United Nations peacekeeping force, are dropped into civil war-torn Mogadishu, Somalia, in an effort to kidnap two of local crime lord Mohamed Farah Aidid's top lieutenants. Among the team: Staff Sgt. Matt Eversmann (Josh Hartnett), Ranger Lt. Col. Danny McKnight (Tom Sizemore), the resourceful Delta Sgt. First Class Jeff Sanderson (William Fichtner), and Ranger Spec. Grimes (Ewan McGregor), a desk-bound clerk getting his first taste of live combat. When two of the mission's Black Hawk helicopters are shot down by enemy forces, the Americans -- committed to recovering every man, dead or alive -- stay in the area too long and are quickly surrounded. The ensuing firefight is a merciless 15-hour ordeal and the longest ground battle involving American soldiers since the Vietnam War. In the end, 70 soldiers are injured and 18 are dead, along with hundreds of Somalians. Black Hawk Down was voted one of the top ten films of the year by the National Board of Review prior to its limited Oscar-qualifying release. On the basis of his work in this film, co-star Eric Bana, a relatively unknown Australian actor playing Delta Sgt. First Class "Hoot" Gibson, won the lead in director Ang Lee's version of The Hulk (2003)(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Johnson Family Vacation</title>
    <desc lang="en">Comedian Cedric the Entertainer serves as both producer and star of this comedy about a family who discovers just how much can go wrong en route to a family get-together. When Nate Johnson (Cedric the Entertainer) is invited to a big family reunion in Missouri, he sees it as an opportunity to reconnect with his estranged wife and growing children, as well as a chance to show up his wealthier know-it-all brother, Mack (Steve Harvey). Nate takes delivery on an expensive new SUV, persuades his recently separated wife, Dorothy (Vanessa L. Williams), to tag along, and packs up his three kids -- nubile teenager Nikki (Solange Knowles), under-age wannabe rapper D.J. (Bow Wow), and precocious seven-year-old Destiny (Gabby Soleil) -- for what he imagines will be a leisurely drive from Los Angeles to St. Louis. However, between his wary wife, arguing kids, angry police officers, bizarre hitchhikers, bad diner food, and an unfortunate run-in with a cement mixer, getting from point A to point B proves to be just short of a nightmare. Johnson Family Vacation was the first feature film for director Christopher Erskin, who previously distinguished himself directing music videos for the likes of Missy Elliot, TLC, and Boyz II Men(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Free to Murder Again. The Texas penal system wakes up from a nightmare in the A&amp;E program American Justice: Free to Murder Again. The subject of the documentary is serial killer Kenneth McDuff, the biggest mistake the parole board ever made. McDuff was first sentenced to death in 1968 for killing three teenagers. Seemingly, his incarceration meant the end of his murder spree. But due to the overcrowding of Texas jails, McDuff was eventually released after serving only 21 years. Soon, the criminal was back on the streets harassing children and adults alike. In 1991, McDuff abducted and killed a young woman only to repeat the pattern two years later with a pregnant mother of two. When he was captured and resentenced to death, his murderous trail was reported to include a handful of others. McDuff's situation alerted the government to the failures of the parole boards. His case eventually resulted in a slew of new prison constructions and tough law reforms(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Free to Murder Again. The Texas penal system wakes up from a nightmare in the A&amp;E program American Justice: Free to Murder Again. The subject of the documentary is serial killer Kenneth McDuff, the biggest mistake the parole board ever made. McDuff was first sentenced to death in 1968 for killing three teenagers. Seemingly, his incarceration meant the end of his murder spree. But due to the overcrowding of Texas jails, McDuff was eventually released after serving only 21 years. Soon, the criminal was back on the streets harassing children and adults alike. In 1991, McDuff abducted and killed a young woman only to repeat the pattern two years later with a pregnant mother of two. When he was captured and resentenced to death, his murderous trail was reported to include a handful of others. McDuff's situation alerted the government to the failures of the parole boards.

    <desc lang="en">The three petrolheads demonstrate their love of small cars with a trip to Ukraine. Jeremy Clarkson chooses a Volkswagen Up for the journey, while Richard Hammond takes a Ford Fiesta and James May opts for a Dacia Sandero. On their adventure, the trio absorb the history of the Crimean Peninsula, including a visit to an old submarine pen - but the carefree exploration looks likely to become a chore when Jeremy, Richard and James are challenged to a long drive north through the expansive country, during which they must combat serious boredom. And as if that wasn't arduous enough, a new task is set when they arrive in Kiev - a trip into the wasteland of Chernobyl. This edition also features a track test of the Danish Zenvo ST1 supercar and James Blunt returns for another drive in the Reasonably Priced Car.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Existenz</title>
    <desc lang="en">Canadian filmmaker David Cronenberg, who has long been fascinated by the ways new technology shapes and manipulates the human beings who believe they are its masters, is in familiar territory with eXistenZ, a futuristic thriller which combines elements of science fiction, horror and action-adventure. What is eXistenZ? According to the glossary Cronenberg put together for this film, it is a new organic game system that, when downloaded into humans, accesses their central nervous system, transporting them on a wild ride in and out of reality. What's more, it changes every time it is played, by adapting to the individual user -- you have to play the game to find out why you are playing the game. More than one person can plug into the same game and set out on a series of bizarre and surrealistic adventures together. The narrative takes place sometime in the near future, when game designers are worshipped as superstars and players can organically enter inside the games. Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh), the goddess among computer game designers whose latest invention, 'eXistenZ,' taps deeply into its users' fears and desires by blurring the boundaries between reality and escapism, is subject to an assassination attempt and forced to flee. Her sole ally is Ted Pikul (Jude Law), a novice security guard sworn to protect her. Persuading Ted to play the game, Allegra draws them both into a phantasmagoric world where existence ends and eXistenZ begins. Jennifer Jason Leigh, who is supposedly something of a computer nerd in real life, is hip and sexily alluring as Allegra Geller. When she and Pikul make love and are transported to the bizarre setting of a trout farm which has been converted to an assembly line production plant for games, they delve deeper into the dangerously intriguing game. Soon the forces of Anti-eXistenZialism will close in on Pikul and Allegra. eXistenZ marks the first time since Videodrome that Cronenberg has written a completely original screenplay. eXistenZ was inspired by the tribulations of the fugitive writer Salman Rushdie, author of the Satanic Verses. After interviewing the author for a magazine article in 1995, Cronenberg was struck with the idea of an artist who suddenly finds himself on a hit list for religious or philosophical reasons and is forced to go into hiding. The idea of a game came later on, for which he created a new vocabulary. According to Cronenberg, eXistenZ thematically connects to Crash, Videodrome, Naked Lunch and even M. Butterfly in terms of exploring the extent to which we create our own levels of reality and the idea of a creative act being dangerous to the creator. This is the second film on which Alliance Atlantis has been associated with Cronenberg, after Crash, which won the Special Jury Prize at the 1996 International Cannes Film Festival. On the occasion of the presentation of eXistenZ, Cronenberg received a Silver Bear for his outstanding artistic achievements at the 49th International Berlin Film Festival in 1999(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Abyss</title>
    <desc lang="en">Approved by director James Cameron, The Abyss - Special Edition is an extended director's cut of the 1989 underwater science fiction epic, reinstating nearly a half hour of footage removed from the original release under studio pressure. The plot remains the same: the crew of an experimental, high-tech submersible is called into action to investigate a mysterious nuclear submarine crash. A series of strange encounters leads the crew to suspect the accident was caused by an extraterrestrial craft, and that they may be participating in an encounter with an alien species. However, in order to make contact, they must not only brave the abyss, an exceedingly deep underwater canyon, but also deal with the violent actions of one of their own crew members, an increasingly paranoid Navy SEAL officer. Much of the restored footage places these events in a grander political context, as the crew's mission becomes a factor in the dangerous escalation of nuclear tension between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The largest change involves the film's ending, which provides further information on the aliens' mission on Earth, bringing the film to closer to Cameron's intention: a modern remake of Robert Wise's The Day the Earth Stood Still(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Canadian filmmaker David Cronenberg, who has long been fascinated by the ways new technology shapes and manipulates the human beings who believe they are its masters, is in familiar territory with eXistenZ, a futuristic thriller which combines elements of science fiction, horror and action-adventure. What is eXistenZ? According to the glossary Cronenberg put together for this film, it is a new organic game system that, when downloaded into humans, accesses their central nervous system, transporting them on a wild ride in and out of reality. What's more, it changes every time it is played, by adapting to the individual user -- you have to play the game to find out why you are playing the game. More than one person can plug into the same game and set out on a series of bizarre and surrealistic adventures together. The narrative takes place sometime in the near future, when game designers are worshipped as superstars and players can organically enter inside the games. Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh), the goddess among computer game designers whose latest invention, 'eXistenZ,' taps deeply into its users' fears and desires by blurring the boundaries between reality and escapism, is subject to an assassination attempt and forced to flee. Her sole ally is Ted Pikul (Jude Law), a novice security guard sworn to protect her. Persuading Ted to play the game, Allegra draws them both into a phantasmagoric world where existence ends and eXistenZ begins. Jennifer Jason Leigh, who is supposedly something of a computer nerd in real life, is hip and sexily alluring as Allegra Geller. When she and Pikul make love and are transported to the bizarre setting of a trout farm which has been converted to an assembly line production plant for games, they delve deeper into the dangerously intriguing game. Soon the forces of Anti-eXistenZialism will close in on Pikul and Allegra. eXistenZ marks the first time since Videodrome that Cronenberg has written a completely original screenplay. eXistenZ was inspired by the tribulations of the fugitive writer Salman Rushdie, author of the Satanic Verses. After interviewing the author for a magazine article in 1995, Cronenberg was struck with the idea of an artist who suddenly finds himself on a hit list for religious or philosophical reasons and is forced to go into hiding. The idea of a game came later on, for which he created a new vocabulary. According to Cronenberg, eXistenZ thematically connects to Crash, Videodrome, Naked Lunch and even M. Butterfly in terms of exploring the extent to which we create our own levels of reality and the idea of a creative act being dangerous to the creator. This is the second film on which Alliance Atlantis has been associated with Cronenberg, after Crash, which won the Special Jury Prize at the 1996 International Cannes Film Festival. On the occasion of the presentation of eXistenZ, Cronenberg received a Silver Bear for his outstanding artistic achievements at the 49th International Berlin Film Festival in 1999(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Abyss</title>
    <desc lang="en">Approved by director James Cameron, The Abyss - Special Edition is an extended director's cut of the 1989 underwater science fiction epic, reinstating nearly a half hour of footage removed from the original release under studio pressure. The plot remains the same: the crew of an experimental, high-tech submersible is called into action to investigate a mysterious nuclear submarine crash. A series of strange encounters leads the crew to suspect the accident was caused by an extraterrestrial craft, and that they may be participating in an encounter with an alien species. However, in order to make contact, they must not only brave the abyss, an exceedingly deep underwater canyon, but also deal with the violent actions of one of their own crew members, an increasingly paranoid Navy SEAL officer. Much of the restored footage places these events in a grander political context, as the crew's mission becomes a factor in the dangerous escalation of nuclear tension between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The largest change involves the film's ending, which provides further information on the aliens' mission on Earth, bringing the film to closer to Cameron's intention: a modern remake of Robert Wise's The Day the Earth Stood Still(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Bats</title>
    <desc lang="en">Beware of what goes "bump" (and "squeak" and "flap flap flap") in the night. Dr. Sheila Casper (Dina Meyer) is a respected zoologist dispatched by the government to Gallup, TX, a small community suffering from an unusual number of reported bat attacks. Casper finds this news puzzling, since bats are generally placid creatures who avoid contact with humans. The local sheriff, Emmett Kimsey (Lou Diamond Phillips), assures Casper that the reports are on the level and that something needs to be done about swarms of aggressive bats so thick they blot out the moon. Caspar and Kimsey discover that a new breed of genetically altered bats have escaped from a research facility and taken up residence in a cave near Gallup -- but the nocturnal bloodsuckers have no intention of leaving as quickly as they arrived. Bats was written by John Logan, who had two other projects hit the screen within a few months of Bats' release: Oliver Stone's Any Given Sunday and Ridley Scott's Gladiator. The supporting cast includes Leon and Bob Gunton(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Dumb and Dumber To</title>
    <desc lang="en">Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels reprise their roles as lovable imbeciles Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne in this sequel to Dumb and Dumber from original directing duo Bobby and Peter Farrelly. The movie revisits the titular duo of dumb Harry (Daniels) and dumber Lloyd (Carrey), 20 years after the events of the first film: Harry pays his first visit to his parents since the early '90s, and discovers a two-decade-old postcard from a gal he hooked up with (Kathleen Turner) informing him that she's pregnant. It turns out she had a daughter and put the girl up for adoption. Harry is moved by the prospect of having an adult child out there somewhere (and it just so happens that he needs a kidney transplant), so he and Lloyd embark on a road trip to track down his daughter. They get mixed up in many wacky situations along the way, like finding and stealing their old "Shaggin' Wagon," and being duped into pleasuring an old lady in exchange for her hearing aids(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The five remaining bakers tackle patisserie in the quarter-finals, making 24 cream horns for their signature challenge, before creating mokatines for Mary's technical bake. For the showstopper, the cooks are challenged to make a religieuse a l'ancienne - three tiers of choux pastry eclairs filled with creme patissiere and decorated with icing and buttercream. The contestants must produce something that not only looks and tastes good, but also stays standing before judges Mary and Paul cast a critical eye over their efforts. Presented by Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Brett Ratner's martial-arts action-comedy sequel starring Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan. When the Chinese Ambassador to the US is shot while divulging the whereabouts of a major Triad leader, the American authorities once again send Chief Inspector Lee and Detective James Carter into the fray. Lee quickly corners the would-be assassin, Kenji, but Lee's shock at coming face-to-face with an old friend gives the baddie just enough time to escape. Kenji's trail leads the mismatched cops to Paris, where car chases and a sequence among the under-dressed dancers of the Folies Bergère await them, plus rather a lot of dodgy French stereotypes and a finale atop the Eiffel Tower. Also starring Youki Kudoh and Noémie Lenoir, together with, in unlikely cameos, Max von Sydow and Roman Polanski(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Brett Ratner's martial-arts action-comedy sequel starring Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan. When the Chinese Ambassador to the US is shot while divulging the whereabouts of a major Triad leader, the American authorities once again send Chief Inspector Lee and Detective James Carter into the fray. Lee quickly corners the would-be assassin, Kenji, but Lee's shock at coming face-to-face with an old friend gives the baddie just enough time to escape. Kenji's trail leads the mismatched cops to Paris, where car chases and a sequence among the under-dressed dancers of the Folies Bergère await them, plus rather a lot of dodgy French stereotypes and a finale atop the Eiffel Tower. Also starring Youki Kudoh and Noémie Lenoir, together with, in unlikely cameos, Max von Sydow and Roman Polanski(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A cop and a killer forge a shaky partnership to find out who killed their partners in this throwback buddy action flick starring Sylvester Stallone, and directed by vet Walter Hill. Battle-scarred New Orleans hitman James Bonomo (Stallone) and his longtime partner Louis (Jon Seda) have just executed their latest hit, a cop named Hank Greely (Holt McCallany) when Louis is killed by hulking enforcer Keegan (Jason Momoa) before they can get paid. In the wake of a failed attempt on Bonomo's life as well, Keegan flees the scene, but not before his intended target gets a good look at his face. Meanwhile, Korean NYPD cop Taylor Kwon (Sung Kang) shows up in town determined to find out who killed Greely, his former partner. When Kwon tracks Bonomo down to find out who hired him, both realize that their best hope for catching their respective partners' killers is to team up. Before long, their trail of clues has led them to sleazy lawyer Marcus Baptiste (Christian Slater), who is currently caught up in some shady business dealings with the mysterious and powerful Robert Nkomo Morel (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) that could implicate some serious power players in Washington, D.C. Now each new move that Bonomo and Kwon make could be their last, and as the cop does his best to stay on the right side of the law, the killer uses the only tactics he knows to get results. But even if they manage to get their man, that doesn't change the fact that they'll have to deal with one another once they've taken down their target(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Bullet to the Head</title>
    <desc lang="en">A cop and a killer forge a shaky partnership to find out who killed their partners in this throwback buddy action flick starring Sylvester Stallone, and directed by vet Walter Hill. Battle-scarred New Orleans hitman James Bonomo (Stallone) and his longtime partner Louis (Jon Seda) have just executed their latest hit, a cop named Hank Greely (Holt McCallany) when Louis is killed by hulking enforcer Keegan (Jason Momoa) before they can get paid. In the wake of a failed attempt on Bonomo's life as well, Keegan flees the scene, but not before his intended target gets a good look at his face. Meanwhile, Korean NYPD cop Taylor Kwon (Sung Kang) shows up in town determined to find out who killed Greely, his former partner. When Kwon tracks Bonomo down to find out who hired him, both realize that their best hope for catching their respective partners' killers is to team up. Before long, their trail of clues has led them to sleazy lawyer Marcus Baptiste (Christian Slater), who is currently caught up in some shady business dealings with the mysterious and powerful Robert Nkomo Morel (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) that could implicate some serious power players in Washington, D.C. Now each new move that Bonomo and Kwon make could be their last, and as the cop does his best to stay on the right side of the law, the killer uses the only tactics he knows to get results. But even if they manage to get their man, that doesn't change the fact that they'll have to deal with one another once they've taken down their target(n)</desc>

Carlos and Elena are close friends with Mike White (McCaleb Burnett) and Betty Bristol (Ashley Wolfe), who were born and raised in the States. Like Carlos and Elena, Mike and Betty are planning to marry but haven't done so yet, and when they learn of their friends' dilemma, someone comes up with a solution -- Carlos will marry Betty, Mike will marry Elena, and once their respective green cards come through, both couples will divorce and everyone lives happily ever after. However, the plan doesn't go as smoothly as expected -- suspicious immigration agents are keeping a close watch on Carlos and Elena, so the newlyweds have to live with their respective spouses and act happily married in order to maintain the illusion of matrimony, which leads the four friends into a variety of romantic complications.

And, like all her friends, she dreams of having a chance to appear on it. However, this is Baltimore and it is 1962 - and Tracy's both overweight and, worse, has liberal attitudes to race relations, which don't sit comfortably with the segregationist views of the show's producer (Michelle Pfeiffer). But could Tracy's ambitions for not only appearing on the show, but also racially integrating it, receive a fillip when she meets the son of Motormouth Maybelle (Latifah), host of the monthly 'Negro Day' edition of the show?

    <title lang="en">Slumdog Millionaire</title>
    <desc lang="en">Accused of cheating and desperate to prove his innocence, an eighteen-year-old orphan from the slums of Mumbai reflects back on his tumultuous life while competing to win 20 million rupees on India's Who Wants to Be a Millionaire in Danny Boyle's inspirational drama. Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) may not have a penny to his name, but that could all change in a matter of hours. He's one question away from taking the top prize on India's most popular television game show, but as with everything else in Jamal's life, it isn't going to be easy. Arrested by police under suspicion of cheating, Jamal is interrogated by the authorities. The police simply can't believe that a common "slumdog" could possibly possess the knowledge to get this far in the game, and in order to convince them of how he gained such knowledge, Jamal begins reflecting back on his childhood. As young boys, Jamal and his older brother, Salim, lived in squalor, and lost their mother in a mob attack on Muslims. Subsequently forced to rely on their own wits to survive, the desperate siblings fell back on petty crime, eventually befriending adorable yet feisty young Latika as they sought out food and shelter on the unforgiving streets of Mumbai. Though life on the streets was never easy, Jamal's experiences ultimately instilled in him the knowledge he needed to answer the tough questions posed to him on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. And though Jamal makes a convincing case for himself, one question still remains: why would a young man with no apparent desire for wealth or fame be so determined to win big on a national game show? Of course, it won't be long until everyone finds out the answer to this burning question, because as Jamal sits down to find out whether he will be rich beyond his wildest dreams, 60 million viewers remain transfixed to their televisions eager to see if he'll correctly answer the final question(n)</desc>

It opens with the boys selling greeting cards on the street, none too successfully. One surly guy in particular is a victim of the Stooges' harassment. To get away from his wrath, the boys dash into an apartment building, where they find a weepy young woman who thinks her husband doesn't love her anymore. To help her out, the Stooges offer to try to make her husband jealous. The woman's spouse turns out to be the very same man they harassed a few minutes earlier. To get away from him -- again -- the guys get in what they think is a bread line, but it's really a recruitment line for the Army. In a flash the Stooges are in uniform -- only to discover that their sergeant is the very same angry husband. They manage to make it through basic training and are sleeping through bomb blasts when they're woken up and sent on a mission. The sergeant has been captured and they're supposed to bomb enemy headquarters with laughing gas. Naturally, the gas shell explodes on them and they're captured. At the enemy headquarters, they manage to knock everyone unconscious while laughing uncontrollably. The place is being shelled by the American troops, and the Stooges, still laughing, ride one of the shells as it soars out of the building(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Documentary catching up with London's Crossrail engineers less than two years after the project's excavations uncovered the 14th-century Charterhouse plague pit. In an extraordinary turn of events, further work on the Liverpool Street station has revealed another burial ground, this time accommodating the capital's radicals, rebels and outsiders. The Bedlam burial ground, which is thought to be the final resting place of nearly 20,000 people, was believed to be lost for around 300 years. Now, with the excavation process under way, archaeologists and historians have been using bone analysis techniques in conjunction with parish records to reveal the names and life stories of those whose remains were found on-site. Their research reveals that people came from as far afield as Africa to work in the English capital, and sheds light on how pollution first became one of the city's most prolific killers.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This is the amazing true story of a lonely female African wild dog that has befriended a number of other predators and is helping to raise jackal pups in the Okavango Delta. Once there were plenty of wild dogs living on Mombo Island in the centre of the delta but competition from hyenas and lions decimated the dog packs. Today only one lonely female dog remains. Her name is Solo. Her two male companions disappeared three years ago, presumed killed by lions. What makes this wild dog exceptional is that she is friends with a number of hyenas and jackal families, taking them hunting and providing food for them. For the last two years Solo has helped the jackals raise their pups, regurgitating food for them as if they were her own. The pups accept Solo, as she feeds, grooms and protects them, even chasing away her old hyena friends that wander dangerously close. Living in a land of lions Solo benefits from her friendships as the jackals are forever alert to approaching danger. But when a pack of wild dogs suddenly appears Solo has to make a choice - to stay with her adopted family or join her own kind(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Suspense auteur M. Night Shyamalan takes a break from crafting original screenplays to tell this tale of a 12-year-old boy (Noah Ringer) who provides the last hope for restoring harmony to a land consumed by chaos. In a world balanced on the four nations of Water, Earth, Fire, and Air, people known as the Waterbenders, Earthbenders, Firebenders, and Airbenders have mastered their native elements. Though the masters can each manipulate their native elements, the only one with the power to manipulate all four elements is a young boy known as the Avatar. When the Avatar subsequently appears to die while still mastering his powers, the Fire nation launches a global war with the ultimate goal of global domination. One hundred years later, two teens discover that the Avatar and his flying bison have in fact been locked in suspended animation. Upon being freed from his prison, the Avatar embarks on an arduous quest to restore harmony among the four war-ravaged nations(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">D2: The Mighty Ducks</title>
    <desc lang="en">In this family film, that fledgling flock of unlikely hockey players the Mighty Ducks returns beat the feathers off the opposing teams in the Junior Goodwill games. It all begins when Gordon Bombay, recently thwarted by injuries after he attempted a comeback in pro hockey, is approached by a major sportswear corporation. They want him to reassemble the disbanded Ducks and have them compete in the Goodwill games. Bombay agrees and hits the New York streets to round up his former team.

    <desc lang="en">Frank Marshall's all-out-action film stars Laura Linney, Dylan Walsh, Tim Curry and Ernie Hudson as a disparate group who embark on an expedition into the heart of the Congo. Each has different reasons for setting out into the unknown. But having survived volcanoes and hungry hippo attacks, nothing could have prepared them for the greatest danger: a troop of intelligent killer apes who, as one critic wrote, "..make King Kong look like the Jolly Green Giant". Based on Michael Crichton's bestseller, Marshall's film is great fun, with wonderful cliff-hanging moments and, in Dr Karen Ross (Linney), a character who can out-tough Indiana Jones any day(n)</desc>

Not used to balancing his new life with his old, Todd mistakenly invites family and friends from his old neighborhood to his multi-million-dollar house for a cookout on the same day of an important endorsement interview. Though his extravagant family cookouts were welcome at his old digs, Todd's stuffy new neighbors -- particularly the conservative Republican Judge Halsted Crowley (Danny Glover) -- are less than thrilled with the arrival of Todd's massive family. Complicating the situation further is the eccentric neighborhood security guard (Queen Latifah), who takes on the heady assignment of ensuring that none of the private community's rules are broken, as well as two thugs who, determined to get an autographed pair of sneakers, hold up the cookout at gunpoint. Directed by Lance Rivera, The Cookout also features performances from Ja Rule, Eve, Farrah Fawcett, and Jonathan Silverman(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Frank Marshall's all-out-action film stars Laura Linney, Dylan Walsh, Tim Curry and Ernie Hudson as a disparate group who embark on an expedition into the heart of the Congo. Each has different reasons for setting out into the unknown. But having survived volcanoes and hungry hippo attacks, nothing could have prepared them for the greatest danger: a troop of intelligent killer apes who, as one critic wrote, "..make King Kong look like the Jolly Green Giant". Based on Michael Crichton's bestseller, Marshall's film is great fun, with wonderful cliff-hanging moments and, in Dr Karen Ross (Linney), a character who can out-tough Indiana Jones any day(n)</desc>

Though his extravagant family cookouts were welcome at his old digs, Todd's stuffy new neighbors -- particularly the conservative Republican Judge Halsted Crowley (Danny Glover) -- are less than thrilled with the arrival of Todd's massive family. Complicating the situation further is the eccentric neighborhood security guard (Queen Latifah), who takes on the heady assignment of ensuring that none of the private community's rules are broken, as well as two thugs who, determined to get an autographed pair of sneakers, hold up the cookout at gunpoint. Directed by Lance Rivera, The Cookout also features performances from Ja Rule, Eve, Farrah Fawcett, and Jonathan Silverman(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Hurt Locker</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Kathryn Bigelow's Iraq War-set action thriller presents the conflict in the Middle East from the perspective of those who witnessed the fighting firsthand -- the soldiers. As an elite Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal team tactfully navigates the streets of present-day Iraq, they face the constant threat of death from incoming bombs and sharp-shooting snipers. In Baghdad, roadside bombs are a common danger. The Army is working to make the city a safer place for Americans and Iraqis, so when it comes to dismantling IEDs (improvised explosive devices) the Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) crew is always on their game. But protecting the public isn't easy when there's no room for error, and every second spent dismantling a bomb is another second spent flirting with death. Now, as three fearless bomb technicians take on the most dangerous job in Baghdad, it's only a matter of time before one of them gets sent to "the hurt locker." Starring Jeremy Renner, Guy Pearce, and Ralph Fiennes(n)</desc>

However, a bogus neighborhood Santa Claus (Rickey Smiley) decides to help Craig and Day-Day share the wealth by robbing their apartment, and when he rips off their stereo, he also makes off with their rent money, which was hidden in the speaker cabinets. Desperate to make rent and have some money for Christmas presents, Craig and Day-Day land jobs at a local strip mall, where their fathers, Mr. Jones (John Witherspoon) and Uncle Elroy (Don "D.C." Curry), have gone into business together running a barbecue joint. Craig and Day-Day are installed as security guards, and while Craig tries to make time with Donna (K.D. Aubert), a saleswoman at the Pimp N' Ho's Boutique, and keep things orderly at Holy Moly's Doughnut Shop, Day-Day attempts to transform himself into a master of crime-fighting, which causes a lot more problems than it solves.

    <title lang="en">The Great Raid</title>
    <desc lang="en">John Dahl directed this war drama based on the true story of one of the most daring military actions of World War II. In the waning days of World War II, General Douglas MacArthur chose to make good on a pledge that he made in 1942 -- that he would return to the Philippines after he and his troops were forced to retreat. However, MacArthur's determination was more than a matter of pride. Over 500 American soldiers were being held in Cabanatuan, a notoriously brutal prisoner of war camp in the Philippines operated by the Japanese army, and MacArthur wanted to see to it that they made it home. MacArthur chose Lt. Col. Henry Mucci (Benjamin Bratt) to lead the Sixth Ranger Battalion on a mission 30 miles behind enemy lines to infiltrate Cabanatuan and liberate the American prisoners. With the help of Capt. Prince (James Franco), Mucci leads his men on a life-or-death raid against forces known for their savagery. The Great Raid was based on William B. Breuer's book The Great Raid on Cabanatuan: Rescuing the Doomed Ghosts of Bataan and Corregidor, and also stars Joseph Fiennes, Connie Nielsen, and Marton Csokas(n)</desc>

A group of dorm-room cutups, wallowing in their uncorrectness, declares war on the uptight student activists who call the shots. Saturday Night Live's David Spade is among the leading players; while he's funnier here than in his costarring stints in Chris Farley's films, he doesn't have much to work with. The subject matter covered in P.C.U. has already been tackled, with far funnier results, on Bill Maher's cable-TV weekly Politically Incorrect(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Alan Paton's classic novel about two fathers coming to terms with personal loss and the emotional scars inflicted on South Africa during the era of apartheid was brought to the screen for a second time with this adaptation, the first major film produced in South Africa after Nelson Mandela's election ended mandatory white rule in that nation. Rev. Stephen Kumalo (James Earl Jones) is a minister from a poverty-stricken farming community who travels to Johannesburg for the first time in search of his son Absalom (Eric Miyeni), who moved to the city some time back and has gone missing. Kumalo regards the big city as a den of iniquity, and his low expectations are not betrayed; he is robbed and beaten shortly after he arrives, and when he visits his brother John (Charles S. Dutton), he discovers that Absalom has become a petty thief with a pregnant girlfriend, his sister Gertrude (Dambisa Kente) is a prostitute, and John has renounced his faith in God and advocates the violent overthrow of South Africa's white leadership. James Jarvis (Richard Harris) -- a wealthy white landowner from the same part of the country as Kumalo -- has also arrived in Johannesburg, also with sad personal business to attend to; his son, a well-liked activist for the rights of the city's black majority population, was killed during a robbery(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Perfect Holiday</title>
    <desc lang="en">Gabrielle Union, Morris Chestnut, Queen Latifah, and Terrence Howard star in a film concerning a young girl who implores a department-store Santa to find a new husband for her divorced mother for Christmas. Single mother of three Nancy (Union) has been putting the needs of her three children ahead of her own for as far back as she can remember, and lately her youngest daughter, Emily (Khail Bryant), has become acutely aware of her mother's palpable sadness. As Christmas draws near, Nancy takes her kids to the mall for a cheerful visit with jolly old Saint Nick. When it comes time for Emily's turn to sit on Santa's lap and make her Christmas wish, she selflessly remembers her mother's recent comment that a compliment from a man would be the best gift of all. Determined to make her mother happy again even if it means sacrificing her own wish, Emily relays the message to Santa (Chestnut), not realizing that the man beneath the beard is actually an office-supply salesman and ambitious singer/songwriter named Benjamin. Recognizing the daughter's love for her mother and sensing something truly special in Nancy, Benjamin cheerfully obliges the young girl, setting into motion a series of events that promise to make this the most memorable holiday in quite some time. Lance Rivera directs a film produced by Shakim Compere and Latifah through Flavor Unit Entertainment(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Boy With the Answer. Bones is back for a fifth season of creative crime-solving that will include its landmark 100th episode.

The episode's conclusion revealed the hallucination/dream came from the mind of a drugged-up Booth, who had undergone surgery for a brain tumour. As Brennan kept a vigil at his bedside, the cop came round from his operation unsure of who she was. Season five picks up a few weeks later and Booth is back at work, but still suffering with side effects from his memory loss(n)</desc>
