    <desc lang="en">The toys are back in town! Yes, Woody, Buzz and all the other characters from 1995 Disney blockbuster Toy Story are back in this stunning sequel, voiced as before by top stars like Tom Hanks and Tim Allen. Taking the science of computer animation to an even higher level, the film uses state-of-the-art technology to tell spellbinding stories. Andy, who owns the toys, has gone off to cowboy camp and left the toys to their own devices - and toys will be toys. Woody is kidnapped by a collector, who knows he's a valuable toy from a 1950s show called Woody's Roundup. Soon Woody meets all his co-stars and makes new friends, while his old friends rush to rescue him before Andy gets back. This is modern story-telling at its best: a real must see movie(n)</desc>

The series cast its spotlight on rare animals, unique to specific regions of the United States. Regular weekly features included "K9 Cops and Animal Heroes," "Celebrity Owners," and "Animal Bloopers." First telecast in the fall of 1995, Wild About Animals was still flourishing at the end of the 20th century, by which time it was being shown in tandem with two other Rotfield efforts, The Lighter Side of Sports and Awesome Adventures, in most local markets(n)</desc>

Mushrooms are one of Mary's favourite ingredients and she goes foraging for wild varieties in the New Forest, before cooking garlic mushrooms on toasted brioche and mushroom Scotch eggs - ideal for a country picnic hamper. To follow, Mary makes paprika pheasant with mushroom sauce. The Great British Bake Off judge also tries her hand at fly-fishing on the River Test, cooking up her catch on the riverbank.

    <desc lang="en">Gabby Logan presents live coverage of the 37th staging of the annual event on the streets of London, as tens of thousands of runners take on the 26.2-mile course. Kenya's Eliud Kipchoge broke away from compatriot Stanley Biwot last year to claim victory in the men's race in a time just eight seconds shy of the world record, but he is likely to face stiff competition this year from Ethiopian track great Kenenisa Bekele. The women's event was also won by a Kenyan, with Jemima Sumgong recovering from a fall to edge out Ethiopia's Tigist Tufa by five seconds. In the wheelchair races, Great Britain's David Weir is aiming for a record seventh victory in what is set to be his final race, while America's Tatyana McFadden goes for her fifth straight title in the women's event. Commentary by Steve Cram, Brendan Foster, Andrew Cotter and Tanni Grey-Thompson, and reports from Colin Jackson, Steve Brown, Ore Oduba and Jazmin Sawyers.(n)</desc>

Together they hope to transform a small, damp bungalow into a cutting-edge home to share with their twin three-year-old daughters - all for just £80,000. The design is radical - to reinforce the walls of the old property and add a new living space on top to take advantage of the views. This extra floor will be made entirely of thick wooden panels engineered in Germany and normally assembled by a crew of specialist installers. However, budget constraints mean the couple are determined to do it all themselves.(n)</desc>

What they construct is a time-lapse snapshot of the planet, detailing everything from the evolution of China's megacities to the construction of giant solar arrays of Nevada, and their work reveals the extent to which human civilisation has transformed the planet - for better or worse.(n)</desc>

Astronauts including Tim Peake trawl through a treasure trove of whole-planet shots, beginning with the iconic 1972 image `Blue Marble' , which marked the first-ever time a photograph was taken of the entire Earth. What they construct is a time-lapse snapshot of the planet, detailing everything from the evolution of China's megacities to the construction of giant solar arrays of Nevada, and their work reveals the extent to which human civilisation has transformed the planet - for better or worse.(n)</desc>

A former urban couple who moved to a rural valley in north Wales to breed horses enter open conflict with the owners of a nearby yurt business, whose fireworks parties spooked one of their prized beasts, resulting in an injury.

    <desc lang="en">The three petrolheads demonstrate their love of small cars with a trip to Ukraine. Jeremy Clarkson chooses a Volkswagen Up for the journey, while Richard Hammond takes a Ford Fiesta and James May opts for a Dacia Sandero. On their adventure, the trio absorb the history of the Crimean Peninsula, including a visit to an old submarine pen - but the carefree exploration looks likely to become a chore when Jeremy, Richard and James are challenged to a long drive north through the expansive country, during which they must combat serious boredom. And as if that wasn't arduous enough, a new task is set when they arrive in Kiev - a trip into the wasteland of Chernobyl. This edition also features a track test of the Danish Zenvo ST1 supercar and James Blunt returns for another drive in the Reasonably Priced Car.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Richard Hammond visits Abu Dhabi's Yas Marina circuit to drive the Porsche 918 Spyder, a four-wheel-drive hybrid hypercar capable of astonishing speeds thanks to the 886 horsepower it can generate from its screaming V8 petrol engine and electric motors. Jeremy Clarkson and James May join forces to create a public information film to promote safer cycling, with their efforts presented to a panel of experts including members of Westminster Council and Olympic gold medal-winning rider Chris Boardman. Meanwhile, Jeremy - who has promised to change his name to Jennifer if the Porsche is faster around the test track than the McLaren P1 driven earlier in the series - compares the seventh-generation Volkswagen Golf GTI to BMW's critically acclaimed M135i. Breaking Bad star Aaron Paul fires up the Reasonably Priced Car to see what lap time he can achieve.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Clare Balding travels to South Africa to join a veterinary team trying to help a rhino called Thandi who was attacked by poachers for her horn. For the first time, a plastic surgeon will attempt a skin graft on the animal to heal the wound. She also visits the rainforest of Borneo to follow the story of an orangutan who needs cataracts removing from her eyes so that she can be released back into the wild. Elsewhere, vet Steve Leonard takes a trip to Chicago's Lincoln Park Zoo, where the latest technology is being used to help chimpanzees with heart disease. He also visits the South African city of Pretoria, where a Cape fur seal requires a CT scan to identify the root cause of her illness, and a giraffe urgently needs to be anaesthetised to treat a leg injury.(n)</desc>

Dr. Sheila Casper (Dina Meyer) is a respected zoologist dispatched by the government to Gallup, TX, a small community suffering from an unusual number of reported bat attacks. Casper finds this news puzzling, since bats are generally placid creatures who avoid contact with humans. The local sheriff, Emmett Kimsey (Lou Diamond Phillips), assures Casper that the reports are on the level and that something needs to be done about swarms of aggressive bats so thick they blot out the moon. Caspar and Kimsey discover that a new breed of genetically altered bats have escaped from a research facility and taken up residence in a cave near Gallup -- but the nocturnal bloodsuckers have no intention of leaving as quickly as they arrived. Bats was written by John Logan, who had two other projects hit the screen within a few months of Bats' release: Oliver Stone's Any Given Sunday and Ridley Scott's Gladiator.

Both are talented racers, but K.C. has a wilder and more reckless approach, while Trip follows a more cautious path. A more profound difference between them arises when K.C. is offered a lucrative deal to ride for a factory-sponsored team; he takes the deal, and leaves his brother behind to race on his own dime. However, when an accident takes Trip out of the running on the supercross circuit, he and K.C. set aside their differences as Trip helps coach his older brother so he can succeed in his drive to the championship.

    <desc lang="en">Paul Thomas Anderson adapts Thomas Pynchon's celebrated detective novel in this Annapurna Pictures production. Joaquin Phoenix stars as Larry "Doc" Sportello, a pot-smoking private eye at the tail end of the psychedelic '60s who investigates a kidnapping case involving his old flame Shasta Fay Hepworth (Katherine Waterston) and her missing sugar daddy Mickey Wolfmann (Eric Roberts), a powerful real-estate mogul. In the course of his investigation Doc butts heads with Lt. Det. Christian F. "Bigfoot" Bjornsen (Josh Brolin), a part-time actor with a palpable distain for the free-love generation, and a reputation for committing civil-rights violations. Later, as clues to Wolfmann's disappearance begin to suggest a conspiracy involving the FBI and a mysterious underworld syndicate known as the Golden Fang, Doc seeks the help of his lawyer Sauncho Smilax, Esq. (Benicio Del Toro) and Deputy D.A. Penny Kimball (Reese Witherspoon). Meanwhile, Doc also agrees to search for Coy Harlingen (Owen Wilson), a reportedly deceased saxophone player who may not be as dead as rumors suggest, and who seems somehow tied to the ongoing Wolfmann investigation.

    <desc lang="en">David Cronenberg and William S. Burroughs: a potent, disgusting combination. This is not actually a film version of the infamous novel, but a fusion of Burroughs' biography and his literary style (like Steven Soderberg's underappreciated Kafka). Peter Weller plays exterminator Bill Lee, whose wife (Judy Davis) gets hooked on the bug powder and drags Bill along for the hallucinatory ride. He starts to receive secret messages from giant mutant beetles and kills his wife in a misguided game of William Tell. Under orders from the bugs, Bill becomes a writer and gets advice and orders from his own insectoid typewriter. Eventually, he goes to the mysterious city of Interzone, where he meets more creepy writer types and is introduced to more and more exotic mind-altering chemicals. Not for insectophobes(n)</desc>

Arrested by police under suspicion of cheating, Jamal is interrogated by the authorities. The police simply can't believe that a common "slumdog" could possibly possess the knowledge to get this far in the game, and in order to convince them of how he gained such knowledge, Jamal begins reflecting back on his childhood. As young boys, Jamal and his older brother, Salim, lived in squalor, and lost their mother in a mob attack on Muslims. Subsequently forced to rely on their own wits to survive, the desperate siblings fell back on petty crime, eventually befriending adorable yet feisty young Latika as they sought out food and shelter on the unforgiving streets of Mumbai. Though life on the streets was never easy, Jamal's experiences ultimately instilled in him the knowledge he needed to answer the tough questions posed to him on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. And though Jamal makes a convincing case for himself, one question still remains: why would a young man with no apparent desire for wealth or fame be so determined to win big on a national game show? Of course, it won't be long until everyone finds out the answer to this burning question, because as Jamal sits down to find out whether he will be rich beyond his wildest dreams, 60 million viewers remain transfixed to their televisions eager to see if he'll correctly answer the final question(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Golden Compass</title>
    <desc lang="en">Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig and Dakota Blue Richards star in Chris Weitz's family fantasy-adventure, based on the first book in Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy. Twelve-year-old orphan Lyra Belacqua lives in an Oxford college, where the academic and domestic staff do their best to push her enquiring mind down conventional educational routes and quell her tomboy tendencies; it's a losing battle. One day, having sneaked into a private meeting of the college's dons, Lyra learns of mysterious events taking place in the Arctic. Soon after, amid news of mysterious child abductors called the 'Gobblers', her best friend Roger vanishes. The fearless Lyra sets off, determined to rescue her playmate. But Lyra's is a parallel universe: one with VIctorian-style technology; where people's souls take the form of character-suggesting visible animals; witches and talking, armoured polar bears rule the cold lands of the north; and an organisation called The Magisterium aims to assert its authority over everyone. Lyra's journey will prove a dangerous one; one that uncovers the terrible truth that links the Gobblers and the Arctic phenomenon she heard about in the safety of Oxford. Also starring Eva Green, and the voices of Freddie Highmore and Ian McKellan. Sadly, it now looks as though the following two films in the series are fated not to be made. Even so, this stands as a stirring, thoughtful family adventure that's reasonably true to Pullman's masterpiece(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Slumdog Millionaire</title>
    <desc lang="en">Accused of cheating and desperate to prove his innocence, an eighteen-year-old orphan from the slums of Mumbai reflects back on his tumultuous life while competing to win 20 million rupees on India's Who Wants to Be a Millionaire in Danny Boyle's inspirational drama. Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) may not have a penny to his name, but that could all change in a matter of hours. He's one question away from taking the top prize on India's most popular television game show, but as with everything else in Jamal's life, it isn't going to be easy. Arrested by police under suspicion of cheating, Jamal is interrogated by the authorities. The police simply can't believe that a common "slumdog" could possibly possess the knowledge to get this far in the game, and in order to convince them of how he gained such knowledge, Jamal begins reflecting back on his childhood. As young boys, Jamal and his older brother, Salim, lived in squalor, and lost their mother in a mob attack on Muslims. Subsequently forced to rely on their own wits to survive, the desperate siblings fell back on petty crime, eventually befriending adorable yet feisty young Latika as they sought out food and shelter on the unforgiving streets of Mumbai. Though life on the streets was never easy, Jamal's experiences ultimately instilled in him the knowledge he needed to answer the tough questions posed to him on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. And though Jamal makes a convincing case for himself, one question still remains: why would a young man with no apparent desire for wealth or fame be so determined to win big on a national game show? Of course, it won't be long until everyone finds out the answer to this burning question, because as Jamal sits down to find out whether he will be rich beyond his wildest dreams, 60 million viewers remain transfixed to their televisions eager to see if he'll correctly answer the final question(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Golden Compass</title>
    <desc lang="en">Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig and Dakota Blue Richards star in Chris Weitz's family fantasy-adventure, based on the first book in Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy. Twelve-year-old orphan Lyra Belacqua lives in an Oxford college, where the academic and domestic staff do their best to push her enquiring mind down conventional educational routes and quell her tomboy tendencies; it's a losing battle. One day, having sneaked into a private meeting of the college's dons, Lyra learns of mysterious events taking place in the Arctic. Soon after, amid news of mysterious child abductors called the 'Gobblers', her best friend Roger vanishes. The fearless Lyra sets off, determined to rescue her playmate. But Lyra's is a parallel universe: one with VIctorian-style technology; where people's souls take the form of character-suggesting visible animals; witches and talking, armoured polar bears rule the cold lands of the north; and an organisation called The Magisterium aims to assert its authority over everyone. Lyra's journey will prove a dangerous one; one that uncovers the terrible truth that links the Gobblers and the Arctic phenomenon she heard about in the safety of Oxford. Also starring Eva Green, and the voices of Freddie Highmore and Ian McKellan. Sadly, it now looks as though the following two films in the series are fated not to be made. Even so, this stands as a stirring, thoughtful family adventure that's reasonably true to Pullman's masterpiece(n)</desc>

Given to telling whoppers, Thomas finds himself in a boy-who-cried-wolf dilemma when he overhears two spies plotting to smuggle valuable info out of the US. When he can't get his own father Dabney Coleman to believe him, Thomas turns disconsolately to a computer game called "Cloak and Dagger" and begins to fantasize, imagining that he is in cahoots with secret agent Jack Flack, also played by Coleman. Finally coming to grips with the fact that the mythical Jack Flack cannot help him this time, Thomas takes on the spies with the help of his schoolmates, who are also "Cloak and Dagger" addicts. Cloak and Dagger is a heavily disguised remake of 1949's The Window; both are based on the Cornell Woolrich story The Boy Cried Murder(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Redemption</title>
    <desc lang="en">Writer/director Steven Knight's Redemption stars Jason Statham as a British Special Forces veteran named Smith who has fallen on very hard times. He's an alcoholic homeless man huddling inside a box on a dingy London alley with a fellow homeless woman when a couple of criminals start harassing the junkies and the destitute. He reverts to his training, subdues the baddies, and makes a run for it, ending up in the home of a wealthy creative type who happens to be in New York for the next eight months. Smith movies in, cleans himself up, and gets a job as a toughman for a local Asian gangster. Haunted by horrific acts he committed while serving in Afghanistan, he spends much of the money he makes now to help fund a local soup kitchen run by Sister Cristina (Agata Buzek). When the woman he was with at the beginning of the movie turns up dead, Smith decides to hunt down the man responsible. Meanwhile, Cristina questions her own faith, confronts her haunted past, and makes Smith contemplate his own violent nature. Redemption is the feature directorial debut for Knight, who had previously scripted Eastern Promises and Dirty Pretty Things(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Carlito's Way</title>
    <desc lang="en">Carlito's Way is a tale of a former hood trying to escape his former life. Al Pacino is Carlito Brigante, a high-level Puerto Rican drug dealer sprung from a three-decade jail sentence after only five years, thanks to a technicality and his sleazy, cocaine-addled lawyer, Dave Kleinfeld (Sean Penn). Carlito renounces his previous ways and takes a job as the manager of a club that Kleinfeld has invested in, planning to save enough money so that he can eventually move to the Caribbean. But no sooner is Carlito back on the streets of New York than his old life claws at him in the form of both old partners (Luis Guzman) and vicious up-and-comers (John Leguizamo). Nevertheless, Carlito stays clean and even restarts his relationship with a dancer named Gail (Penelope Ann Miller), until he is finally led astray by Kleinfeld, who manipulates Carlito into participating in the murder of a Mafia don from whom Kleinfeld has stolen a million dollars. At that point, the race is on to see whether Carlito and Gail can escape his world for good. The film is based on two novels about Carlito written by New York State judge Edwin Torres(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Drumline</title>
    <desc lang="en">After decades of movies about college sports, the bands who take the field at halftime finally get their day in the sun in this musical comedy drama. Devon Miles (Nick Cannon) is a talented young percussionist from Harlem who wins a music scholarship to Atlanta A &amp; T, a prestigious African-American university. For years, Atlanta A &amp; T has won awards for their show-style marching band, who combine expert musicianship (incorporating funk, R&amp;B, and jazz rhythms into the traditional marching band repertoire) with choreography, dancing cheerleaders, and roof-raising showmanship. Dr. Aaron Lee (Orlando Jones), the school's band director, gives Devon a spot in the marching band's drumline, the heart and soul of a show-style band, but discovers Devon's previous musical education hardly meets his usual standard when he learns that his new drummer can't read music. Devon soon earns a reputation as a stubborn individualist within the band, not necessarily a good thing in an ensemble where a strictly unified performance is considers the ideal. Devon's cocksure attitude and streetwise style doesn't mesh very comfortably with Sean Taylor (Leonard Roberts), a disciplined senior who resents the presence of the upstart freshman in the drumline, and things become even less harmonious when Devon begins making a play for Laila (Zoe Saldana), a beautiful girl who is also being courted by Sean. Songwriter and record producer Dallas Austin, who has worked with Boyz II Men, TLC, and Pink, served as executive producer for Drumline, helped produce the film's musical score, and contributed his own experiences as a marching band member to the screenplay(n)</desc>

One day, having sneaked into a private meeting of the college's dons, Lyra learns of mysterious events taking place in the Arctic. Soon after, amid news of mysterious child abductors called the 'Gobblers', her best friend Roger vanishes. The fearless Lyra sets off, determined to rescue her playmate. But Lyra's is a parallel universe: one with VIctorian-style technology; where people's souls take the form of character-suggesting visible animals; witches and talking, armoured polar bears rule the cold lands of the north; and an organisation called The Magisterium aims to assert its authority over everyone. Lyra's journey will prove a dangerous one; one that uncovers the terrible truth that links the Gobblers and the Arctic phenomenon she heard about in the safety of Oxford. Also starring Eva Green, and the voices of Freddie Highmore and Ian McKellan. Sadly, it now looks as though the following two films in the series are fated not to be made. Even so, this stands as a stirring, thoughtful family adventure that's reasonably true to Pullman's masterpiece(n)</desc>

Stability in Bridget's life, however, quickly becomes a contradiction in terms. Though Mark is openly supportive of Bridget's eccentricities -- and there are many -- she is nonetheless threatened by Mark's young, nubile intern, not to mention irked at finding out that he is, among other less desirable qualities in her eyes, a conservative voter. Complicating issues further is the reentrance of her ex-lover, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant), whom Jones, perhaps mistakenly, thought she had finally gotten over. Before long, the situation escalates into another series of embarrassing circumstances for Bridget, who is faced once again with a crippling feeling of self-doubt and has only her diary and friends to combat it(n)</desc>

As is her habit, Sam ends up playing amateur detective herself, this time at a fancy health spa called Drummonds. One of the spa's customers, a woman named Debbie (Allison Smith) is found murdered, and suspicion immediately falls upon Alice (Bess Meyer), whose husband George (Scott Grimes) and Debbie were having an affair. Complicating matters is the presence of a psychic named Emily (Felicia Day) who with unbecoming eagerness offers to direct the police to the location where Debbie's body has been hidden. As a result, Emily herself is accused of the murder--and at this point Sam and her friends Cassie (Nina Siemaszko) and Philby (Clarence Williams III)--the latter a former CIA agent!--try their hand at ferreting out the real killer. Mystery Woman: Vision of Murder debuted June 5, 2005(n)</desc>

Accidentally double-booked, they both discover the truth about their spouse's secret existence and are now in danger, not only from their respective organisations, but also from each other.

    <title lang="en">Summer Catch</title>
    <desc lang="en">This summer could not be more crucial for Ryan Dunne, a blue-collar kid with aspirations to become a major league baseball player. Every summer, the hottest college ball players descend upon Cape Cod to pursue their baseball dreams during the day and blow off steam in town at night. The first local boy in years to earn a slot in the team, Ryan finally got his shot but the temptations off-field are getting in the way of his commitment to the game. Soon, a beautiful young woman who summers in the town with her family distracts Ryan. As the friction builds between his loyal townie friends and his cocky teammates, Ryan's rivalry with hotshot teammate Eric comes to a head. When a major league scout comes along, however, he tries to push the pangs of romance and player rivalry aside, because his sports talent may be his only ticket out of the small industrial town(n)</desc>

Those lies include being a closet homosexual while being married to a woman and committing continual fraud to support the lavish lifestyle associated with being what he considers the epitome of a gay lifestyle. After being sent to prison for his crimes, the cop-turned-con man falls in love with his sensitive and charismatic cellmate, Phillip Morris (Ewan McGregor). Smitten, Russell devotes his entire life to being with Morris regardless of the consequences -- which could well include a life sentence(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Enemy at the Gates</title>
    <desc lang="en">A turning point in 20th century war history is the focus of this fact-based account of the 1942-1943 battle of Stalingrad, in which the Germans were finally defeated by Russian influence -- one of the bloodiest battles in World War II history. The film stars Jude Law as Vassili, a marksman from the Urals who is transported to Stalingrad in 1942, and a master German sniper, Major Koenig (Ed Harris). Koenig, an expert German sniper, is determined to eliminate his formidable opponent by any means necessary; meanwhile, Vassili has joined forces with Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), a young Russian political adversary, who is impressed by Vassili's skills and raises his profile in the Soviet Union. Both Vassili and Danilov become involved with Tanya (Rachel Weisz), whose Jewish parents have been captured by the Germans and have forced her to take up with the men on a sniper expedition. Koenig and Vassili begin to develop traps for each other, until fate inevitably must bring the two sharpshooters together. This large-scale production, financed mostly by Teuton companies, also features Bob Hoskins as Nikita Krushchev and Ron Perlman as an aging Russian sniper(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A massive corporate conglomerate, Octopus Inc., run by a shrewd and cruel tycoon named Rod McCain, purchases a UK-based leisure company, and also the failing London Marwood Zoo. To bring more business to the zoo, Octopus hires a new manager, Rollo Lee, who promptly comes up with a way to increase profits-do away with all the animals except for the ferocious ones. This new Fierce Creatures Policy shocks the Marwood zookeepers, led by the unendingly talkative Adrian "Bugsy" Malone. Eventually, Rod McCain's son Vince, along with the up-and-coming business executive Willa Weston, take control of the zoo and revoke the Fierce Creatures Policy. Vince instead comes up with many under-handed and vicious schemes to attract customers-unauthorized celebrity endorsements, shoddy, overpriced zoo merchandise, and using robotic animals instead of real ones. However, Vince is also stealing from the zoo's funds, and when his father finds out, he rears to turn the zoo into a Japanese-owned golf course. Meanwhile, Willa has grown to love the zoo and its animals, and, along with her newly-reformed love interest Rollo, plot with the zookeepers to save the zoo from the McCains(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Valkyrie</title>
    <desc lang="en">At the absolute height of World War II, German generals hatch a daring plan to assassinate Adolf Hitler and effectively render the German war machine impotent. Directed by Bryan Singer, Valkyrie stars Tom Cruise as Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, the real-life mastermind behind the elaborate plot known as Project Valkyrie: a plan to assassinate Hitler and overthrow his government from the inside. Stauffenberg has been a loyal soldier and an asset to the Reich for his entire military career, but after losing an eye, a hand, and three fingers in an Allied bombing, he reaches a breaking point. The destructive madness that his country is unleashing on the world has become too terrible for the colonel to stand silent. He joins the resistance movement -- a treasonous act, punishable by death -- and risks his life and the life of his family for the chance to change history. Comprised of high-ranking officials working in secret, the German Resistance has access to the inner workings of the government and military, putting them in the perfect position to dispatch the dictator and then use his own official contingency plan to seize power -- before the army, the S.S., and loyal party members can put someone just as diabolical in the Führer's place(n)</desc>

Most nights, Ledbetter takes shelter in a cave in Central Park, earning him the nickname "the Caveman." One morning, Ledbetter discovers a frozen corpse caught in the branches of a tree near his cave; the body is that of Scotty (Sean MacMahaon), a homeless drug addict who was close friends with his pal Matthew (Rodney Eastman). Ledbetter is determined to get justice for Scotty, and he's also eager to prove himself to his daughter Lulu (Aunjanue Ellis), now a New York City police officer. While Ledbetter is at first convinced that his nemesis Stuyvesant is responsible for Scotty's death, in time he focuses on another suspect: David Leppenraub (Colm Feore), a famous photographer known for his controversial erotic images of young men, who occasionally hired Scotty as a model. As Ledbetter attempts to investigate Leppenraub's possible role in the murder, he soon gains an unexpected ally -- Moira (Ann Magnuson), a noted sculptor and Leppenraub's sister. The Caveman's Valentine marked the major-studio debut for director Kasi Lemmons, who made an impressive debut in 1997 with the independent drama Eve's Bayou(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Miniature. Robert Duvall stars as Charley Parkes, a shy and lonely man who spends his spare time at the museum, even though his domineering mother (Pert Kelton) would prefer that Charley seek out a suitable girlfriend. But as far Charley is concerned, he already has a sweetheart -- a tiny but lifelike ballerina doll, part of a 19th century dollhouse exhibit. While "conversing" with the doll one day, Charley is startled as the ballerina comes to life -- as do several less appealing miniature characters. Originally telecast February 21, 1963, this Charles Beaumont-scripted Twilight Zone episode was later withdrawn from the series' syndicated package due to a legal complication. "Miniature" did not see the light of day again until 1984, when a semi-colorized version was included in a two-hour syndicated Twilight Zone 25th Anniversary special(n)</desc>

The only hope lies in a crack team of scientists burrowing to the core and re-starting Earth's engine. But is the disaster natural or is there a more sinister explanation? Jon Amiel's science-fiction blockbuster eschews outer space for inner-space in this taut special-effects extravaganza. Edited for language(n)</desc>

Cook (Richard Basehart) discovers via radio contact that a nuclear war has broken out on his home planet. Landing on a distant and barren planet, Cook despairs over the notion that he might be the last living person in the universe. He then meets a beautiful young woman (Antoinette Bower) who has recently escaped a nuclear holocaust on her own world. Let's cut to the chase -- Cook's first name is Adam, and the girl's name is Eve. One of the more heavy-handed of the Rod Serling-scripted Twilight Zone episodes, "Probe 7-Over and Out" was originally broadcast November 29, 1963(n)</desc>

In her third appearance on the series, Gladys Cooper plays elderly, embittered spinster Elva Keene. Already nervous and high-strung, Elva becomes even more so when she begins receiving mysterious, cryptic telephone calls in the dead of night. Could this be the work of pranksters, or is Wanda being besieged by the ghost of her long-dead fiancée Brian? Originally scheduled for broadcast on November 22, 1963, "Night Call" was moved to February 7, 1964 as a result of the JFK assassination coverage(n)</desc>

Will realizes his father is actually super-human crime fighter Captain Stronghold (Kurt Russell), while his mom is fellow champion Josie Jetstream (Kelly Preston). However, in Will's first few days at school, Coach Boomer (Bruce Campbell) is unable to discover any superior abilities in him, meaning that instead of joining the school's budding heroes, he's been relegated to the ranks of the lowly sidekicks. In time, Will discovers he happens to have super strength after all, but will he learn to hone his new gifts in time to fend off the bullies at school, get the girl of his dreams, and save his folks from a longtime nemesis? Sky High also features Lynda Carter, Dave Foley, and Kevin McDonald(n)</desc>
