    <title lang="en">Rachael Ray</title>
    <desc lang="en">Assembled for television by Oprah Winfrey's production company, the daily, hour-long talkfest Rachael Ray starred the former host of several Food Network programs, the author of several best-selling cookbooks, and the maven of many a popular franchised cooking product. At first glance, Rachael Ray may have seemed to be yet another Martha Stewart clone, but a closer examination revealed that Ray preferred to have a looser and more spontaneous format on her series than was seen on Martha's; also, though she certainly dispensed some cooking and housekeeping tips here and there, she did not confine herself to these domestic pursuit.

    <desc lang="en">Assembled for television by Oprah Winfrey's production company, the daily, hour-long talkfest Rachael Ray starred the former host of several Food Network programs, the author of several best-selling cookbooks, and the maven of many a popular franchised cooking product. At first glance, Rachael Ray may have seemed to be yet another Martha Stewart clone, but a closer examination revealed that Ray preferred to have a looser and more spontaneous format on her series than was seen on Martha's; also, though she certainly dispensed some cooking and housekeeping tips here and there, she did not confine herself to these domestic pursuit. The set of Rachael Ray was designed by the hostess herself as a "home away from home", complete with stove and plush chairs. Most of the guests on the series were specialized experts whom Ray had met and befriended during her previous TV life on the Food Network. Rachael Ray was first syndicated the week of September 18, 2006 by King World Productions(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Dead Woman Walking: The Karla Faye Tucker Story. This documentary, part of the American Justice series from A&amp;E, examines the Texas death penalty case of Karla Faye Walker. Narrated by American Justice host and producer Bill Kurtis, this episode goes inside the investigation of the two murders that Walker and her boyfriend Daniel Ryan Garrett committed. The trial of Walker is shown through exclusive footage. After the conviction, American Justice follows her through her daily life, showing her prison surroundings and talking with her about her crimes. Sentenced to death, while Walker was waiting to be executed, she became a born-again Christian. Her lawyers used this transformation as leverage to try to get her death sentence reduced to life in prison. Their attempts were unsuccessful and Walker was killed by lethal injection in February 1998. American Justice also shows interviews with lawyers and law enforcement professionals who knew Walker(n)</desc>

Actually, this is a clever ploy to bilk an insurance company out of thousands of dollars. Unfortunately for Al, a relentless insurance agent dogs his trail to make certain that he is truly incapable of donning shoes--and even more unfortunately, Al is slated to bowl in a tournament where the judges frown upon barefoot contests. The two traditional Queen sports-event songs (YOU know the titles), heard in the network version of this episode, were replaced by stock music in the syndicated version(n)</desc>

Before long, he is working as both a seeing-eye dog, and as a drug-sniffing pooch for the police. Unfortunately, Brian's addictive personality gets the better of him when he comes across a cache of cocaine. This lands the Griffen family's dog in rehab, where he is told that his master Peter is a bad influence. Thus does Brian secretly sneak off for a long, long trip, far, far away from Quahog.

    <desc lang="en">The Telltale Head. While Bart Simpson (voice of Nancy Cartwright) may be the terror of the fourth grade, his delinquency is small potatoes compared to Jimbo (voice of Pamela Hayden), an older aspiring hooligan who runs with a crowd of rough kids. Bart decides to take in a showing of "Space Mutants IV" at the local movie house, but before he can buy his ticket, he runs into Jimbo, who offers to let Bart sneak in with him and his friends through the theater's rear exit. After spending the afternoon with Jimbo and his friends, Bart wants to do something to really impress his new pals; after joining them as they throw rocks at a statue of Jebediah Springfield, the town's founder, Bart thinks of a way to really show Jimbo he's tough -- he cuts off the statue's head. Soon it seems everyone in Springfield is up in arms about this act of vandalism -- including Jimbo, who informs Bart "I'd never cut the head off a guy who iced a bear with his bare hands!" Bart belatedly comes to the conclusion that he's gone too far, and owns up to the crime to his parents. Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) decides to help Bart return the head, but they run afoul of an angry mob protesting the desecration of the statue. "The Telltale Head" was first aired on February 25, 1990(n)</desc>

However, Marge's plans change when Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright) comes home with various items from "Yuk-ingham Palace," the neighborhood novelty shop, super-glued to his face and she has to take him to the doctor. While Marge insists Lisa must stay home, Lisa tricks her easily misled father Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) into giving his permission for her to take the bus to the museum. But Lisa misreads the schedule and ends up on the outskirts of Springfield, and she flies into a panic when she ends up in the city's Russian district. When Homer and Marge realize Lisa is lost, Homer leaps into action to find her, though his actions make a difficult situation all the more complicated.

    <desc lang="en">A hired gun from the future discovers that his greatest adversary is himself in this twisting sci-fi mindbender starring Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and directed by Rian Johnson (Brick, The Brothers Bloom). In the year 2047 time travel has yet to be invented. Thirty years later, however, it has. Though immediately outlawed, time-travel technology is quickly appropriated by the mob, and used to cleanly dispose of anyone deemed a threat. The process is simple: When the mob wants someone to disappear, they simply send them back to the year 2047, where an assassin known as a "looper" quickly carries out the hit, and disposes of the body. Joe Simmons (Gordon-Levitt) is one of the most respected loopers around. Each kill earns him a big payday, and he's got big plans to retire to France. Then, one day, as Joe patiently awaits the appearance of his next target near the edge of a remote corn field, he's shocked to come face-to-face with his future self (Bruce Willis). When the younger Joe hesitates, the older Joe makes a daring escape. Now, in order to avoid the wrath of his underworld boss (Jeff Daniels), young Joe must "close the loop" and kill his older counterpart. Meanwhile, the revelation that a powerful crime boss in the future has set the underworld ablaze pits the two Joes on a violent collision course, with the fate of a devoted mother (Emily Blunt) and her young son hanging in the balance.

On the surface, Po (voice of Black) may look like just another portly panda bear, but beneath his fur he bears the mark of the chosen one. By day, Po works faithfully in his family's noodle shop, but by night he dreams of becoming a true master of the martial arts. Now an ancient prophecy has come to pass, and Po realizes that he is the only one who can save his people from certain destruction. With time running short and malevolent snow leopard Tai Lung (Ian McShane ) closing in, Furious Five legends Tigress (Jolie), Crane (David Cross ), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu), Monkey (Chan), and their wise sensei, Master Shifu (Hoffman), all draw on their vast knowledge of fighting skills in order to transform a lumbering panda bear into a lethal fighting machine. Now, if the noble Po can master the martial arts and somehow transform his greatest weaknesses into his greatest strengths, he will fulfill his destiny as the hero who saved his people during their darkest hour(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">All the Pretty Horses</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Billy Bob Thornton explores coming of age in this Western based on Cormac McCarthy's prize-winning novel of the same name. John Grady Cole (Matt Damon) and Lacey Rawlins (Henry Thomas) are young Texan men who seek a more fulfilling life as cowboys in the slowly fading Old West, circa 1949. One night, the duo head for Mexico in hope of finding some adventure and employment, and along the way run into Blevins (Lucas Black), an even younger drifter who has supposedly stolen a horse from private property. Begrudgingly, Cole and Rawlins take him under their wing before they eventually find themselves in Mexico, working for a wealthy landowner (Ruben Blades). His stalwart and beautiful daughter Alejandra (Penelope Cruz) develops a romantic interest in Cole, which threatens the friendship between him and Rawlins, not to mention their living quarters, where Alejandra's watchful aunt (Miriam Colon) warns Cole that she has professed allegiance to her. Cole and Rawlins' thrill-seeking adventures with Blevins and the stolen horse catch up to them, however, and they are held prisoners in a brutal penitentiary, where their cowboy instincts are put to the ultimate test. Cole, meanwhile, wants nothing more than to get back to Alejandra and resume their love affair. The film also features Bruce Dern in a small role as a judge who eventually gives much-desired guidance to Cole(n)</desc>

Discovered at a local talent show by ambitious manager Curtis Taylor Jr. (Jamie Foxx), the trio known as "the Dreamettes" is soon offered the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of opening for popular singer James "Thunder" Early (Eddie Murphy). Subsequently molded into an unstoppable hit machine by Taylor and propelled into the spotlight as "the Dreams," the girls quickly find their bid for the big time taking priority over personal friendship as Taylor edges out the ultra-talented Effie so that the more beautiful Deena can become the face of the group. Now, as the crossover act continues to dominate the airwaves, the small-town girls with big-city dreams slowly begin to realize that the true cost of fame may be higher than any of them ever anticipated(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Director Billy Bob Thornton explores coming of age in this Western based on Cormac McCarthy's prize-winning novel of the same name. John Grady Cole (Matt Damon) and Lacey Rawlins (Henry Thomas) are young Texan men who seek a more fulfilling life as cowboys in the slowly fading Old West, circa 1949. One night, the duo head for Mexico in hope of finding some adventure and employment, and along the way run into Blevins (Lucas Black), an even younger drifter who has supposedly stolen a horse from private property. Begrudgingly, Cole and Rawlins take him under their wing before they eventually find themselves in Mexico, working for a wealthy landowner (Ruben Blades). His stalwart and beautiful daughter Alejandra (Penelope Cruz) develops a romantic interest in Cole, which threatens the friendship between him and Rawlins, not to mention their living quarters, where Alejandra's watchful aunt (Miriam Colon) warns Cole that she has professed allegiance to her. Cole and Rawlins' thrill-seeking adventures with Blevins and the stolen horse catch up to them, however, and they are held prisoners in a brutal penitentiary, where their cowboy instincts are put to the ultimate test. Cole, meanwhile, wants nothing more than to get back to Alejandra and resume their love affair. The film also features Bruce Dern in a small role as a judge who eventually gives much-desired guidance to Cole(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">He's mean, he's green, and he's doesn't like the Yuletide season one bit -- Jim Carrey stars in this live-action adaptation of the classic children's story by Dr. Seuss (aka Theodore Geisel). High atop Mt. Crumpet, the Grinch (Carrey) observes the residents of Whoville joyously preparing to celebrate Christmas. The Grinch was born in Whoville years ago, but was shunned due to his scary appearance, and his unrequited love for Martha May Whovier has turned him bitter; the good cheer of the Whos has been a thorn in his side ever since. Finally the Grinch decides he's had enough of all this happiness, and with the wary aid of his dog Max, the Grinch conspires to steal Christmas from Whoville, making off with their presents, holiday decorations, Christmas trees, and everything else used to enjoy the holiday. Molly Shannon, Christine Baranski, Jeffrey Tambor, and Clint Howard play several of the citizens of Whoville, while Anthony Hopkins narrates (taking over from the late Boris Karloff, who memorably read Dr. Seuss' story in Chuck Jones' 1966 animated adaptation of the story). Ron Howard directs(n)</desc>

The loss was too much for Cheryl to take, and before long she sank so deeply into heroin addiction that it destroyed her marriage. Four years later, Cheryl has hit rock bottom.

Later, as Cheryl begins her arduous journey through the wilderness, those painful memories come flooding back as she encounters numerous dangers and disheartening setbacks.

    <desc lang="en">A heroin trafficker whose wife was abducted and murdered hires a haunted private investigator to track down the men who killed her in this brooding crime drama starring Liam Neeson. Matt Scudder (Neeson) was an NYPD cop having a quiet drink in a Washington Heights bar when a pair of armed robbers came in guns blazing. Giving chase, Scudder kills the robbers in the street, though a stray bullet turns a heroic moment tragic. Devastated, Scudder subsequently goes to work as an unlicensed private detective, working just outside of the law and surviving on generous gifts offered in exchange for his services. Now, tasked with rooting out the sadistic thugs who brutally murdered the wife of a wealthy drug dealer (Dan Stevens), Scudder scours the bars and back alleys of New York City in search of his elusive targets -- and the closer he gets, the more apparent it becomes that they are something much more sinister than your typical kidnappers(n)</desc>

Long ago, on the planet of Cybertron, a massive, powerful alien race divided into two factions, the noble Autobots, and the devious Decepticons. They fought for the sole access to a talisman known as the Allspark, a cube with the capacity to grant infinite power, and eventually the Autobots smuggled it off the planet's surface, hiding it in an unknown location on Earth. Now, hundreds of years later, the Deceptacons have come looking for it, and if the Autobots don't find it first, the Earth will be enslaved or destroyed by the evil aliens' use of its massive power. The Autobots don't know where the cube was hidden, but the information may be stored in the most unlikely of sources, as a gangly young Earthling named Sam Witwicky (LaBeouf) who's just picked up his first car, has a strange connection to the Allspark's history, making him the unlikely ally of these enormous creatures, as they fight for humankind's survival and the chance to return home(n)</desc>

Elizabeth Short (Mia Kirshner) was a struggling actress looking to make a name for herself in 1940s-era Tinseltown. Unfortunately for Elizabeth, it was her grim fate that would ultimately overshadow anything she would accomplish during her short and tragic career. When police discover Elizabeth's body cut clean in half and with all of her organs missing, ex-pugilist detectives Lee Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart) and Bucky Bleichert (Josh Hartnett) are the men charged with cracking the case and apprehending the killer. This isn't your average murder case, however, and as Blanchard's marriage to Kay (Scarlett Johansson) begins to suffer due to his obsession with the sensational crime, his partner Bleichert discovers a troubling link between the victim and the mysterious Madeleine Linscott (Hilary Swank), a prominent socialite and the daughter of one of the town's most connected key players(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) returns to the screen for another round of supernatural adventures on the high seas in this spirited sequel to the 2003 Disney hit, which re-teams original director Gore Verbinski with original screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio. As Will (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) prepare to exchange vows at the altar, their wedding plans hit rough waters with the arrival of sea-bound scallywag Jack Sparrow. It seems that Sparrow owes a substantial blood debt to half-octopus sea captain Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), and that the only way for the flamboyant sea rover to elude the wrath of his otherworldly pursuer is to seek the aid of mysterious and powerful voodoo priestess Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris), whose ability to resurrect the dead and gaze into the future may provide just the advantage needed to avoid a waterlogged fate in the locker of his legendary nemesis(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">30 Days of Night</title>
    <desc lang="en">Hard Candy director David Slade took the helm for this adaptation of Steve Niles' terrifying comic-book series of the same name. In Barrow, AK, one night can last an eternity. One month every year, this town is plunged into darkness for 30 days due to its location far north of the Arctic Circle. While extended periods of darkness are something that the locals have become accustomed to, this year something sinister is about to emerge from the long and unforgiving night. As a maniacal horde of vampires assumes control of the city streets and begins to feast freely upon the terrified citizens, the local sheriff (Josh Hartnett), his wife (Melissa George), and a small but resilient band of survivors will be forced to choose between saving themselves or helping the few remaining members of their community survive the blood-soaked siege. Original comic creator Niles collaborated with screenwriters Stuart Beattie and Brian Nelson to pen the film, which was produced under Sam Raimi's Ghost House Pictures banner(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Oscar-winner Paul Haggis (Crash) writes and directs this romantic drama that alternates between three tales of intrigue unfolding simultaneously in New York, Paris, and Rome. Pulitzer Prize-winning author Michael (Liam Neeson) is still reeling from the recent separation from his wife Elaine (Kim Basinger) when he retreats to a Paris hotel room to finish his latest novel. As Michael searches for inspiration, his fiery affair with smoldering journalist and aspiring writer Anna (Olivia Wilde) awakens an intense passion deep within him. Meanwhile, in Rome, unscrupulous American businessman Scott (Adrien Brody) ducks into a place called the Café Americano searching for a taste of home. There he encounters captivating Roma beauty Monika (Moran Atias), who claims to have just lost the ransom she intended to pay her daughter's kidnappers. Smitten and sympathetic, Scott agrees to join her in traveling to a dangerous region of southern Italy, only to realize along the way that he may have fallen victim to an intricate con. As Scott ventures toward an uncertain fate in an unfamiliar country, former soap-opera starlet Julia (Mila Kunis) fights her prolific, ex-husband artist Rick (James Franco) for custody of their six-year-old son in New York City. It seems like a losing battle until Julia's lawyer Theresa (Maria Bello) convinces the court to give her desperate client one last chance to prove she's a fit mother. Now as Julia finds herself on the other side of the glamorous life she once enjoyed, her husband's new girlfriend Sam (Loan Chabanol) watches the situation play out with a heavy heart(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Mel Brooks and his wife Anne Bancroft co-star in this funny remake of a 1942 comedy of the same title, based on a story by Ernst Lubitsch and Melchior Lengyel about a down-and-out Warsaw theater troupe who save the Polish resistance fighters from the SS in World War II. Frederick Bronski (Brooks) leads a struggling theatrical company that offers anything -- from excerpts of Hamlet to stock vaudeville -- if it will pull in an audience. Unknown to Frederick, his wife Anna Bronski (Anne Bancroft) starts up an extra-marital interest in a Polish pilot (Tim Matheson) that could lead to a large-scale disaster. The pilot unknowingly reveals the names of the Bronskis and several resistance fighters to an SS spy (José Ferrer), and by the time he finds out what he has done, he is in London, so he is forced to return surreptitiously to Warsaw as fast as he can to stop the list of names from landing in the hands of the SS chief (Charles Durning). Once the theater troupe is called in to help on this mission, the comedy begins in earnest with the actors donning the guise of Nazis, and Anna seguing into "seductions" of the SS spy and his chief as a part of their battle plan(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Boat Trip</title>
    <desc lang="en">Two guys looking for a respite from their bumpy romantic lives find themselves in the midst of a very confusing situation in this broad comedy. Jerry (Cuba Gooding Jr.) is a guy who thinks he's found the love of his life in Felicia (Vivica A. Fox), his beautiful longtime girlfriend. Jerry decides to propose to Felicia, and arranges for a hot-air balloon ride in order to create the ideal setting to pop the question. However, Felicia not only turns him down, she announces that she's leaving him for another man. Jerry sinks into a deep depression, until his best friend Nick (Horatio Sanz), who has been having his own romantic problems, suggests they take a vacation cruise on an ocean liner, forgetting their troubles while they make time with bikini-clad babes. Jerry is game, but after an angry misunderstanding with a travel agent, Nick and Jerry discover they've been booked on a tour specifically for gay men. Jerry and Nick are forced to pose as lovers to ward off the indefatigable advances of aging playboy Lloyd (Roger Moore), which cramps their style when the ship's captain rescues a boatload of buxom Swedish swimsuit models. Jerry's spirits rise when he meets Gabriella (Roselyn Sanchez), a beautiful dancer who is part of the ship's entertainment staff. Jerry, however, now has to walk a fine line between maintaining his cover and convincing Gabriella that despite outward appearances, he's not gay. Boat Trip was the first feature film from director Mort Nathan, best known for his work as a writer for television(n)</desc>

Determined to succeed despite the constant reminders of just how single she truly is, Pippa is horrified to learn that the man her father has chosen as her publishing mentor is the same man that she drunkenly came on to at her close friend's recent wedding(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">"Another basement, another elevator...how can the same thing happen to the same guy twice?" asks John McClane (Bruce Willis), in what is doubtless the key question of this film. A year after foiling the terrorist takeover of a high-rise office building in the first movie, McClane is waiting to pick up his wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), at Dulles International Airport just outside Washington, D.C., on Christmas Eve. Scheduled to arrive the same evening is Ramon Esperanza (Franco Nero), a South American political figure who is being brought to the United States to stand trial for his role in a drug-smuggling ring. However, a group of terrorists, led by renegade American military officer Col. Stuart (William Sadler), take control of the airport, scuttling radio transmissions and placing their own men in the control tower. Stuart and his men ensure that Esperanza's plane lands safely, and then demand that Stuart and his men be given a fully-fueled 747 and free passage wherever they choose to go. Otherwise, they will guide the many circling jets waiting for landing instructions into definite crash landings, killing the many passengers on board. Not willing to stand aside as terrorists once again threaten his wife's life, the wise-cracking McClane once again leaps into action to foil Stuart's plans and bring the passenger jets safely to the ground. William Atherton, John Amos, Dennis Franz, and John Leguizamo highlight the supporting cast(n)</desc>

When he hears the details of their plot, he thinks it amounts to suicide, and blows their plans by telling the Italian guards. His action earns their hatred, and the moniker 'von Ryan'. But Ryan is eventually able to make it up to his comrades when he spies the opportunity to hijack a train to get them all to safety in Switzerland. But they've still got a lot of the Italian countryside to cover, with the Nazis and Fascists determined to stop them, plus more trouble than they were expecting from their fellow Allied forces.

    <desc lang="en">An aging slacker and former sperm donor discovers that he is the biological father of 533 children, and that 142 of them have filed a lawsuit to learn his true identity in this Dreamworks comedy starring Vince Vaughn. Aside from the fact that he was a regular visitor at a fertility clinic 20 years ago, there's nothing particularly remarkable about David Wozniak (Vince Vaughn): He drives a meat-delivery truck for his father's butcher business, he can't seem to hold down a relationship, and lately he's taken to growing marijuana as a means of paying off an $80,000 debt. He's so inept at even the simplest things that his girlfriend Emma (Cobie Smulders) can't stand the sight of him after she reveals that she's pregnant with his child. When an attorney tracks David down and reveals that he is the biological father of 533 children, and that 142 of them have filed a lawsuit to learn his true identity, the former donor panics, recruiting his lawyer friend Brett (Chris Pratt) to defend the privacy agreements he signed at the clinic. When Brett returns with an envelope containing profiles of all 142 children named in the lawsuit, however, David can't help but look, and before long he's surreptitiously injecting himself into the lives of his unsuspecting offspring. Meanwhile, as he begins to grow excited at the prospect of having his own child, he finds that sometimes the best fathers are the men who seem the least fit for parenting(n)</desc>

Aside from the fact that he was a regular visitor at a fertility clinic 20 years ago, there's nothing particularly remarkable about David Wozniak (Vince Vaughn): He drives a meat-delivery truck for his father's butcher business, he can't seem to hold down a relationship, and lately he's taken to growing marijuana as a means of paying off an $80,000 debt. He's so inept at even the simplest things that his girlfriend Emma (Cobie Smulders) can't stand the sight of him after she reveals that she's pregnant with his child. When an attorney tracks David down and reveals that he is the biological father of 533 children, and that 142 of them have filed a lawsuit to learn his true identity, the former donor panics, recruiting his lawyer friend Brett (Chris Pratt) to defend the privacy agreements he signed at the clinic. When Brett returns with an envelope containing profiles of all 142 children named in the lawsuit, however, David can't help but look, and before long he's surreptitiously injecting himself into the lives of his unsuspecting offspring. Meanwhile, as he begins to grow excited at the prospect of having his own child, he finds that sometimes the best fathers are the men who seem the least fit for parenting(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Though not officially acknowleged at the time of its telecast, the made-for-TV movie The Last Survivors was a rehash of the 1957 theatrical feature Abandon Ship; both in fact were based on the same true story. A typhoon at sea has sunk a ship, leaving Alexander Holmes (Martin Sheen) as the highest ranking officer to survive. Commandeering a crowded lifeboat, Holmes must face the fact that the tiny vessel is in danger of floundering itself--and there's another typhoon on the way. Thus is Holmes forced to "play God", decided who among the passengers will allowed to remain in the lifeboat, and who will be cast overboard. Broadcast by NBC, The Last Survivors debuted on March 4, 1975. ~Saw Film/TV Guide/Marrill/Internet/Expert(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Dead Poets Society</title>
    <desc lang="en">Robin Williams toned down his usually manic comic approach in this successful period drama. In 1959, the Welton Academy is a staid but well-respected prep school where education is a pragmatic and rather dull affair. Several of the students, however, have their thoughts on the learning process (and life itself) changed when a new teacher comes to the school. John Keating (Williams) is an unconventional educator who tears chapters of his textbooks and asks his students to stand on their desks to see the world from a new angle. Keating introduces his students to poetry, and his free-thinking attitude and the liberating philosophies of the authors he introduces to his class have a profound effect on his students, especially Todd (Ethan Hawke), who would like to be a writer; Neil ( Robert Sean Leonard), who dreams of being an actor, despite the objections of his father; Knox (Josh Charles), a hopeless romantic; Steven (Allelon Ruggiero), an intellectual who learns to use his heart as well as his head; Charlie (Gale Hansen), who begins to lose his blasé attitude; unconventional Gerard (James Waterston); and practical Richard (Dylan Kussman). Keating urges his students to seize the day and live their lives boldly; but when this philosophy leads to an unexpected tragedy, headmaster Mr. Nolan (Norman Lloyd) fires Keating, and his students leap to his defense. Dead Poets Society was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Williams; it won one, for Tom Schulman's original screenplay(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May are in Russia as the motoring magazine returns, taking part in a race across the urban landscape of St Petersburg. James defends the honour of the car in a very small Renault, Richard tries to prove that pedalling is faster by riding a bicycle, while Jeremy attempts to demonstrate that water is the quickest way across town by piloting a hovercraft. To make matters more complicated, all three presenters are racing not only one another but also the Stig, who is making his way toward the finish line by public transport. Plus, the new Lamborghini Huracan is put through its paces and singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran takes to the test track in the Reasonably Priced Car.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Locomotion: Dan Snow's History of Railways</title>
    <desc lang="en">The historian and broadcaster charts the development of the UK's rail network, from its beginnings as a primitive system of trackways for coal carts in the early 18th century up to the present day. Rapid industrial growth during the 19th century, coupled with the prospect of vast profits, drove inventors and entrepreneurs to develop steam locomotives, metal tracks and an array of daring tunnels, cuttings and bridges that created a nationwide system of railways in just 30 years. George Stephenson's Liverpool and Manchester Railway became the model for future inter-city travel and his fast, reliable locomotive the Rocket began a quest for speed that has defined the modern world.(n)</desc>

The team battles the rain, wind and dangerously unstable trackways, but the combination of sheer effort and hi-tech kit enables the experts to access the heart of an old mine.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Close friends Janet Perrie and Fiona Hope moved to the South Ayrshire village of Dipple in search of an idyllic new life for themselves and their 22 dogs. Unfortunately for them, other residents were enraged by the noise, smell and mess and wasted no time in contacting the authorities. In a cul-de-sac in Leicestershire, the Pollard, Walne and Elliott families have been harassed by 68-year-old Leslie Collins for more than a decade after they complained about the noise from an illegal wood-waste business he was running from his home. He then began to target them with increasingly intimidating behaviour - including mooning, two-finger salutes, shouting abuse, cutting holes in hedges and spying on them with binoculars.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Leeds United v Middlesbrough (Kick-off 7.45pm). Coverage of the Championship encounter at Elland Road, where the away side will be looking to continue their promotion push. Aitor Karanka's Boro have been among the leading pack for most of the season, and they spent big in the January transfer window in a bid to help their chances of promotion, bringing in Blackburn Rovers striker Jordan Rhodes for a fee that could potentially rise to £11million. Steve Evans has steadied the ship at Leeds since he took over as manager, and his side will fancy their chances here in front of their own fans.(n)</desc>

Aitor Karanka's Boro have been among the leading pack for most of the season, and they spent big in the January transfer window in a bid to help their chances of promotion, bringing in Blackburn Rovers striker Jordan Rhodes for a fee that could potentially rise to £11million. Steve Evans has steadied the ship at Leeds since he took over as manager, and his side will fancy their chances here in front of their own fans.(n)</desc>
