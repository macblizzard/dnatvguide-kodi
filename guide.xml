First, he returns to Cafe Hon in Baltimore, Maryland, where owner Denise Whiting was trapped in a nasty battle with the community and had threatened the locals with lawsuits. Next, the chef goes back to Chiarella's in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. When he first visited owners Tommy and Dina DeFino, the business was struggling so badly that Tommy had completely lost his confidence and wife Dina had lost her patience. On his final stop, Gordon travels to Leone's in Montclair, New Jersey, where Rose Leone was depending on her lazy son Michael to run the restaurant.(n)</desc>

Her mother Karen claimed that her daughter had gone missing on her way home from school, prompting a nationwide search.

This documentary tries to get at the truth of a woman many have branded as evil, asking what drove her to do it, how she can rebuild her life and whether she is sorry for her actions.(n)</desc>

It turns out that the operation was also laundering money for the mob, so he agrees to help prosecutors build a case against the other executives and testify in court in exchange for going into hiding.

George knew nothing about the company's crimes; he's just the convenient fall guy. It turns out that the operation was also laundering money for the mob, so he agrees to help prosecutors build a case against the other executives and testify in court in exchange for going into hiding. George packs up his much younger second wife (Denise Richards), his bitter teenage daughter (Danielle Campbell), his neglected younger son (Devan Leos), and his dementia-addled mother (Doris Roberts), and together they travel to the safe house that Brian (Tyler Perry), the case's lead prosecutor, has chosen for them. However, that safe house is really the home of Brian's tell-it-like-it-is aunt Madea (also played by Perry), who helps the family get over their personal and legal issues(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">On June 16, 2016, Labour MP for Batley and Spen Jo Cox was assaulted and gunned down following a constituency surgery in Batley, West Yorkshire. Her attacker was Thomas Mair, a local man whose personal political views are said to have been antithetical to Cox's, and were thought to have driven him to murder. This documentary makes use of eye-witness testimonies to tell the story of the brutal attack that brought an end to the life of a passionate and ambitious parliamentarian. The film profiles her killer, presenting a portrait of a conflicted, contradictory man who volunteered to help people of all races, but harboured a secret obsession with Nazism and the extreme right-wing.(n)</desc>

For years, Bruce (Edward Norton) has been living in the shadows, pursued by the military and haunted by the rage within. But traveling the world in secrecy isn't easy, and as hard as he tries Bruce can't get Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) off his mind. The daughter of Bruce's nemesis Gen. Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross (William Hurt), Betty represents everything that is beautiful in the world to a man who lives his life on the run. Eventually, Bruce returns to civilization and faces the wrath of The Abomination. While the Hulk may be a formidable force of nature, The Abomination is decidedly more powerful, and determined to destroy Bruce Banner. Created when KGB agent Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) exposed himself to a higher dose of the same radiation that transformed Bruce into The Hulk, The Abomination is unable to change back into human form and holds Bruce accountable for his frightful condition. With time fast running out for both Bruce and The Hulk, New York City is about to become the ultimate urban battle zone as two of the most powerful creatures ever to walk the earth clash in a massive, no-holds-barred fight to the finish(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A racist Korean War veteran living in a crime-ridden Detroit neighborhood is forced to confront his own lingering prejudice when a troubled Hmong teen from his neighborhood attempts to steal his prized Gran Torino. Decades after the Korean War has ended, ageing veteran Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is still haunted by the horrors he witnessed on the battlefield. The two objects that matter most to Kowalski in life are the classic Gran Torino that represents his happier days working in a Ford assembly plant, and the M-1 rifle that saved his life countless times during combat. When Kowalski's teenage neighbor (Bee Vang) attempts to steal his Gran Torino as part of a gang initiation rite, the old man manages to catch the aspiring thief at the business end of his well-maintained semi-automatic rifle. Later, due to the pride of the Asian group, the boy is forced to return to Kowalski's house and perform an act of penance. Despite the fact that Kowalski wants nothing to do with the young troublemaker, he realizes that the quickest way out of the situation is to simply cooperate. In an effort to set the teen on the right path in life and toughen him up, the reluctant vet sets him up with an old crony who now works in construction. In the process, Kowalski discovers that the only way to lay his many painful memories to rest is to finally face his own blinding prejudice head-on(n)</desc>

Into her life comes drifter Peter who, having served in the Gulf war, is obsessed with the idea that he is infected by bugs implanted by the government during medical treatment. She begins to share his paranoia and the pair spiral into a conspiracy theory, becoming violently delusional as they battle the bugs they believe are within them. Based on Tracy Letts' play from Chicago's Steppenwolf theatre, this is a visceral, frightening film, but one that maintains an empathy for its characters up to the apocalyptic finale(n)</desc>

For years, Bruce (Edward Norton) has been living in the shadows, pursued by the military and haunted by the rage within. But traveling the world in secrecy isn't easy, and as hard as he tries Bruce can't get Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) off his mind. The daughter of Bruce's nemesis Gen. Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross (William Hurt), Betty represents everything that is beautiful in the world to a man who lives his life on the run. Eventually, Bruce returns to civilization and faces the wrath of The Abomination. While the Hulk may be a formidable force of nature, The Abomination is decidedly more powerful, and determined to destroy Bruce Banner. Created when KGB agent Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) exposed himself to a higher dose of the same radiation that transformed Bruce into The Hulk, The Abomination is unable to change back into human form and holds Bruce accountable for his frightful condition. With time fast running out for both Bruce and The Hulk, New York City is about to become the ultimate urban battle zone as two of the most powerful creatures ever to walk the earth clash in a massive, no-holds-barred fight to the finish(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A racist Korean War veteran living in a crime-ridden Detroit neighborhood is forced to confront his own lingering prejudice when a troubled Hmong teen from his neighborhood attempts to steal his prized Gran Torino. Decades after the Korean War has ended, ageing veteran Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is still haunted by the horrors he witnessed on the battlefield. The two objects that matter most to Kowalski in life are the classic Gran Torino that represents his happier days working in a Ford assembly plant, and the M-1 rifle that saved his life countless times during combat. When Kowalski's teenage neighbor (Bee Vang) attempts to steal his Gran Torino as part of a gang initiation rite, the old man manages to catch the aspiring thief at the business end of his well-maintained semi-automatic rifle. Later, due to the pride of the Asian group, the boy is forced to return to Kowalski's house and perform an act of penance. Despite the fact that Kowalski wants nothing to do with the young troublemaker, he realizes that the quickest way out of the situation is to simply cooperate. In an effort to set the teen on the right path in life and toughen him up, the reluctant vet sets him up with an old crony who now works in construction. In the process, Kowalski discovers that the only way to lay his many painful memories to rest is to finally face his own blinding prejudice head-on(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Richard Hammond gets behind the wheel of the mid-engined Alfa Romeo 4C on the shores of Lake Como in Italy - but his enjoyment of the lightweight vehicle is disturbed by the arrival of Jeremy Clarkson, who demands a race against his quad bike. Jeremy also visits Belgium, putting the McLaren P1 hypercar to the test in Bruges and around the Spa-Francorchamps Formula One circuit - and its combined power output of more than 900bhp generated from electricity and turbocharged petrol V8 power is likely to cause astonishment. Meanwhile, James May spends time at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan to learn about the army's vehicle redeployment efforts, and Thor star Tom Hiddleston tries to coax the best time he can muster from the Reasonably Priced Car.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The three petrolheads demonstrate their love of small cars with a trip to Ukraine. Jeremy Clarkson chooses a Volkswagen Up for the journey, while Richard Hammond takes a Ford Fiesta and James May opts for a Dacia Sandero. On their adventure, the trio absorb the history of the Crimean Peninsula, including a visit to an old submarine pen - but the carefree exploration looks likely to become a chore when Jeremy, Richard and James are challenged to a long drive north through the expansive country, during which they must combat serious boredom. And as if that wasn't arduous enough, a new task is set when they arrive in Kiev - a trip into the wasteland of Chernobyl. This edition also features a track test of the Danish Zenvo ST1 supercar and James Blunt returns for another drive in the Reasonably Priced Car.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Mark Evans and Joy Reidenberg visit Australia to uncover the reproductive secrets of marsupials.

At a remote research station, Mark uses night-imaging cameras to observe wild males tracking down fertile mates, while Joy uses ultrasound to monitor the progress of a female's pregnancy. Plus, how koalas have mastered gravity-defying intercourse, and the critically endangered rock wallabies that are being given foster mothers.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Rocky II</title>
    <desc lang="en">By concentrating on character development with this first of several sequels to his Oscar-winning smash Rocky (1976), writer/director Sylvester Stallone earned critical praise that would desert him with the boxing saga's shallower subsequent chapters. Stallone returns as Rocky Balboa, a Philadelphia prize fighter enjoying his brief fame after nearly defeating world heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers). When Rocky is offered lucrative product endorsement opportunities, his limited education and lack of sophistication quickly become an impediment to his future success, causing him embarrassment and his pregnant wife, Adrian (Talia Shire), a great deal of financial concern. Meanwhile, Creed is brooding over his near loss to a fighter he considers an amateur far beneath him and decides to goad a reluctant Rocky into a high-profile rematch. With the family resources dwindling and his pride wounded, Rocky decides that fighting is all he knows and makes the fateful decision to climb back into the ring once more with Creed to vie for the championship belt, despite assurances from all concerned that he will blind himself irreparably(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Sylvester Stallone returns to the character which made him famous in this wildly successful sequel. Rocky III starts with the Italian Stallion so famous that his likeness is everywhere, including pinball machines. Fame and complacency soon cause Balboa to lose his title to young thug Clubber Lang (Mr. T), who inadvertently causes the death of Rocky's beloved trainer, Mickey (Burgess Meredith), before their first championship bout. After sinking into a depression, Balboa must regain the love and support of his family, as well as the elusive "eye of the tiger," the hungry need to beat the opponent which former foe Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) teaches him during this film's de rigueur training sequence. In the end, Balboa faces off against Lang for a second time. "Eye of the Tiger," the theme song Stallone commissioned from the band Survivor, became a huge hit single(n)</desc>

In helping to give the orphans of war-torn Sudan a better future, the former outlaw begins to find new meaning in his own life as well(n)</desc>

Bryan and his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) are taking their first tentative steps toward reconciliation when she is viciously murdered, and he is targeted as the prime suspect. Now, with the CIA, FBI, and every cop in the country hot on his trail, Bryan realizes that it's only a matter of time before his enemies get to his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace), too. Determined to keep her alive at any cost, he realizes that his only hope for saving her is to clear his name before he is captured. But while Bryan does possess the "particular set of skills" to stay one step ahead of the men who want his entire family dead, proving that he's innocent of murder and seeing that the real killers face justice might be the last thing he ever does(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Interstellar</title>
    <desc lang="en">Interstellar opens on Earth in the distant future, as Mother Nature is waging war on humanity. Famine is widespread, and all of mankind's resources are now dedicated to farming in a desperate fight for survival. A former NASA pilot and engineer named Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) has become a homesteader in order to support his teenage son Tom (Timothee Chalamet) and 10-year-old daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy). Unfortunately, even that begins to look like a futile endeavor after a sandstorm ravages their close-knit community. Meanwhile, a seemingly supernatural mystery begins to unfold when the "ghost" that dwells in Murph's room sends her a mysterious set of coordinates -- which lead the curious father/daughter duo to a clandestine underground base housing the remnants of NASA. There, renowned physicist Professor Brand (Michael Caine) has been working with a team of astronauts and scientists to find a new planet capable of sustaining human life. Brand quickly persuades Cooper to pilot a mission that will hopefully carry the seeds of human life to a habitable planet in another galaxy. Cooper is soon bound for space with Brand's daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway) and researchers Doyle (Wes Bentley) and Romilly (David Gyasi)(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Victorian.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The remaining home-bakers face a brand new Bake Off challenge, as Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry challenge them to prove their mastery of classics recipes from the Victorian era. The reign of Queen Victoria is thought to have been the period of history that gave birth to modern baking, and for the signature bake, the contestants are asked to produce a game pie, which gives one enthusiastic competitor a chance to use a genuine antique from 1850. Mary sets the bakers to work on a fruit cake from the late 1800s in the technical, creating a finished product covered in sugar paste and marzipan that should resemble a tennis court. Finally, for the showstopper, the competitors must prepare Charlotte Russe, a bavarois, sponge fingers and jelly dessert much-loved by the Victorians, but one that proves tricky to construct at the best of times.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The remaining home-bakers face a brand new Bake Off challenge, as Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry challenge them to prove their mastery of classics recipes from the Victorian era. The reign of Queen Victoria is thought to have been the period of history that gave birth to modern baking, and for the signature bake, the contestants are asked to produce a game pie, which gives one enthusiastic competitor a chance to use a genuine antique from 1850. Mary sets the bakers to work on a fruit cake from the late 1800s in the technical, creating a finished product covered in sugar paste and marzipan that should resemble a tennis court. Finally, for the showstopper, the competitors must prepare Charlotte Russe, a bavarois, sponge fingers and jelly dessert much-loved by the Victorians, but one that proves tricky to construct at the best of times.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The last two semi-finalists head to the Michelin-starred Wild Honey in London's Mayfair, where they face a frenetic lunchtime service under chef patron Anthony Demetre. They then have to recreate one of his signature dishes of stuffed roast saddle of rabbit in Parma ham with girolles, peas, fresh almonds, gem lettuce and fennel, with lime gel, pea puree and a rabbit jus. A final test awaits in which they must use what they have learned from their experience to cook a main course and a dessert for Marcus Wareing and Monica Galetti, who pick one of them to go through to the last round of the contest.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A cop and a killer forge a shaky partnership to find out who killed their partners in this throwback buddy action flick starring Sylvester Stallone, and directed by vet Walter Hill. Battle-scarred New Orleans hitman James Bonomo (Stallone) and his longtime partner Louis (Jon Seda) have just executed their latest hit, a cop named Hank Greely (Holt McCallany) when Louis is killed by hulking enforcer Keegan (Jason Momoa) before they can get paid. In the wake of a failed attempt on Bonomo's life as well, Keegan flees the scene, but not before his intended target gets a good look at his face. Meanwhile, Korean NYPD cop Taylor Kwon (Sung Kang) shows up in town determined to find out who killed Greely, his former partner. When Kwon tracks Bonomo down to find out who hired him, both realize that their best hope for catching their respective partners' killers is to team up. Before long, their trail of clues has led them to sleazy lawyer Marcus Baptiste (Christian Slater), who is currently caught up in some shady business dealings with the mysterious and powerful Robert Nkomo Morel (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) that could implicate some serious power players in Washington, D.C. Now each new move that Bonomo and Kwon make could be their last, and as the cop does his best to stay on the right side of the law, the killer uses the only tactics he knows to get results. But even if they manage to get their man, that doesn't change the fact that they'll have to deal with one another once they've taken down their target(n)</desc>

(and better know by his mother Voletta - who co-produced the movie - as Christopher Wallace). Early on, the young Smalls shows interest in writing and performing rap with his friends, but he drifts into a life of drug dealing instead. Smalls' fortunes look to improve when a demo tape of his music is noticed by big-time producer Sean Combs (who also co-produced the movie, and is played by Derek Luke). Combs signs the rapper to his Uptown Records label, on the understanding that Smalls will forsake his narcotics activities. Director Tillman Jr goes on to track the nascent recording star's trajectory from this promising start, through his constant philandering, his love/ hate relationship with West Coast rapper Tupac Shakur and on to the bitter, ultimately homicidal, rivalry between the East and West Coast rap scenes, which was to bring to an abrupt, permanent end to both men's careers.

    <title lang="en">Bullet to the Head</title>
    <desc lang="en">A cop and a killer forge a shaky partnership to find out who killed their partners in this throwback buddy action flick starring Sylvester Stallone, and directed by vet Walter Hill. Battle-scarred New Orleans hitman James Bonomo (Stallone) and his longtime partner Louis (Jon Seda) have just executed their latest hit, a cop named Hank Greely (Holt McCallany) when Louis is killed by hulking enforcer Keegan (Jason Momoa) before they can get paid. In the wake of a failed attempt on Bonomo's life as well, Keegan flees the scene, but not before his intended target gets a good look at his face. Meanwhile, Korean NYPD cop Taylor Kwon (Sung Kang) shows up in town determined to find out who killed Greely, his former partner. When Kwon tracks Bonomo down to find out who hired him, both realize that their best hope for catching their respective partners' killers is to team up. Before long, their trail of clues has led them to sleazy lawyer Marcus Baptiste (Christian Slater), who is currently caught up in some shady business dealings with the mysterious and powerful Robert Nkomo Morel (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) that could implicate some serious power players in Washington, D.C. Now each new move that Bonomo and Kwon make could be their last, and as the cop does his best to stay on the right side of the law, the killer uses the only tactics he knows to get results. But even if they manage to get their man, that doesn't change the fact that they'll have to deal with one another once they've taken down their target(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Based on the 1999 bestseller by K.C. McKinnon, this touching Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation stars Alicia Silverstone as Dee Dee, a single mom and professional candlemaker who returns to her Maine hometown after a lengthy absence. Having left town with a somewhat sullied reputation, she returns with apparently the best of intentions--bringing her 12-year-old son Trooper (Matthew Knight) along for the sentimental journey. Dee Dee's reappearance is initially met with hostility by veterinarian Lydia, whose husband (and coworker) Sam had once been Dee Dee's sweetheart. Ultimately, however, Lydia warms up to both her "rival" and her son--just before Dee Dee poignantly reveals the real reason for her unexpected homecoming. Filmed for television on location in Nova Scotia, Candles on Bay Street was first broadcast by CBS on November 26, 2006(n)</desc>

Introduced in the previous episode "Mr. Monk, Private Eye", attractive realtor Linda Fusco (Sharon Lawrence) is now the girlfriend of Captain Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine). This fact makes it all the more difficult for Monk (Tony Shalhoub) to pursue his theory that Linda is responsible for the death of her business partner. The fact that Monk would even entertain such a thought causes a rift between himself and Stottlemeyer--one that may prove irreparable when Linda tries to seduce Monk. This remarkable episode flies in the face of conventional TV-series wisdom, which dictates that a recurring character accused of murder is obviously innocent(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Per its title, the History Channel documentary Journey to 10,000 B.C.: The Real Story of Prehistoric Man's Fight for Survival carries viewers on a sweeping trip through the prehistoric era to glimpse how ancient men lived, functioned and struggled to survive. The producers of this film created the documentary as a nonfiction companion piece to the big-budget Hollywood actioner 10,000 B.C. (2008), directed by Roland Emmerich. Here, director David Pardusch paints the period around 10,000 B.C. as an era of intense change, manifest in the gradual extinction of species such as the sabretooth tiger and the woolly mammoth from the face of the Earth, the encroachment of a global ice age, and the gradual and deliberate appearance of homo sapiens on the North American continent. Pardusch also ties the emergence of human beings - who relied on prehistoric mammals for food and clothing - to the extinction of those great beasts. The program travels to archaeological dig sites, where it unearths evidence of how the ancients lived, and also recreates that era onscreen, with vivid CG animations(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Jesse James' Hidden Treasure</title>
    <desc lang="en">As originally produced by - and aired on - The History Channel - this documentary program rests on an unusual thesis. Jesse James (1847-82) continues to court a reputation as one of the most notorious and intriguing outlaws in the American Old West, but certain questions about his life and legacy remain unanswered: notably, the final resting place of the gold that James found (and whether it can still be excavated), as well as his real identity. Some suggest that James was not simply an outlaw plundering for his own selfish gain, but a secret member of the Confederacy committed to helping the South rise up and defeat the Yankee North. This program joins a group of historians-cum-treasure seekers as they embark on an on-camera search for Jesse's treasure and answer long-shrouded questions about him, including his motivation for stealing and the circumstances surrounding his death(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Sucker Punch</title>
    <desc lang="en">The story of Alice in Wonderland receives a hyper-violent makeover in Watchmen and 300 director Zack Snyder's fantastical tale of a young psychiatric patient who escapes into a vivid world of fantasy after being committed to a mental hospital by her abusive stepfather. Set in the 1950s, Sucker Punch takes viewers on an incredible journey into the mind of Babydoll (Emily Browning), who finds herself at the mercy of her malevolent stepfather after her mother passes away. With no remaining family and no friends to turn to, her stepfather has her committed to a bleak mental hospital, where she is scheduled to receive a lobotomy in five days. As the procedure draws near, Babydoll creates a phantasmagorical alternate reality in which she must seek out five items in order to secure her freedom. Should she fail, her mind isn't the only thing she stands to lose. Abbie Cornish, Vanessa Hudgens, Carla Gugino, and Jon Hamm co-star in a film co-written by Snyder and Steve Shibuya(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">David Jason teams up once more with Only Fools and Horses writer John Sullivan for this four-part light-hearted drama series chronicling the adventures of Charles Dickens' popular character in the days before he met David Copperfield. The first episode introduces Wilkins Micawber, an impoverished man suffering a run of bad fortune and constantly struggling to provide for his wife and four children, yet a kind-hearted fellow who dresses and speaks like a gentleman and is always looking on the bright side of life, even when a ruthless money-lender sends a violent ex-convict demanding money with menaces. Eventually the family earn a spot of money by taking in a dramatist as their lodger, prompting Micawber to tell his house guest all about his early life - leading to a series of flashbacks that reveal how and why he came to be in such a woeful position. Co-starring Annabelle Apsion as Micawber's long-suffering wife Emma, with Mark Benton, Jamie Foreman and Adrian Hood.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Tony Robinson and the team brave freezing weather to explore Chapel Hill on the windswept expanse of the East Anglian Fens. Flint axes and ornately carved stone blocks discovered by the landowners suggest a religious building or prehistoric monument once stood on the small Cambridgeshire outcrop, while other theories about the location's history include a Bronze Age burial ground and a lighthouse. However, the first day of the dig produces evidence the site is even older than the archaeologists expected.(n)</desc>

A determined Connie throws herself into work after losing Grace, Tess returns to the department and Honey is surprised when Ethan gives her the cold shoulder - especially after they had been getting so close.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">A Bronx Tale</title>
    <desc lang="en">Robert De Niro makes his directorial debut with this expanded adaptation of Chazz Palminteri's one-character play. De Niro's role of Lorenzo Anello, an Italian-America bus driver, is secondary to the part of his son Calogero. The top dog in Calogero's Bronx neighborhood is flashy "wiseguy" Sonny. When the boy witnesses Sonny commit a murder, he honors the code of the streets and refuses to tell the cops. Sonny befriends him and introduces the impressionable youngster to the creature comforts that mob connections can bring. But though he idolizes Sonny, the boy loves and respects his decent, honest father. It takes a major tragedy for the 17-year-old boy (now played by Lillo Brancato) to decide his true course in life(n)</desc>

De Niro's role of Lorenzo Anello, an Italian-America bus driver, is secondary to the part of his son Calogero. The top dog in Calogero's Bronx neighborhood is flashy "wiseguy" Sonny. When the boy witnesses Sonny commit a murder, he honors the code of the streets and refuses to tell the cops. Sonny befriends him and introduces the impressionable youngster to the creature comforts that mob connections can bring. But though he idolizes Sonny, the boy loves and respects his decent, honest father. It takes a major tragedy for the 17-year-old boy (now played by Lillo Brancato) to decide his true course in life(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A straight-laced high-school valedictorian schemes to get the entire senior class stoned in order to circumvent his principal's mandatory drug-testing policy. Henry Burke (Matt Bush) is the kind of teenager every parent dreams about having; he never ditches school, gets straight A's, and he's secured a college scholarship to pay for his higher education. Unfortunately there's just one thing standing in between Henry and his bright future -- his high-school principal. An uptight authoritarian with a hard-line anti-marijuana stance, Principal Gordon (Michael Chiklis) announces that the entire senior class will undergo mandatory drug testing, and anyone who refuses will be immediately expelled. Henry has just danced with Mary Jane for the very first time, and now his entire future is on the line thanks to a few innocent tokes. But Henry is a bright kid, and when he and local pothead Travix Breaux (Sean Marquette) put their heads together, they come up with a brilliant plan to subvert the testing policy: if they can just get every student in school stoned, Principal Gordon's plan to crucify his pot-loving charges will go completely up in smoke(n)</desc>

A key member of the FBI's elite Soviet Analytical Unit, Robert Hanssen (Chris Cooper) would, for 15 years beginning in 1985, sell thousands of pages of classified documents to the Soviets. After making roughly 600,000 dollars on his clandestine endeavor and compromising everything from the identities of KGB spies working for the American government to nuclear war contingency plans, Hanssen was eventually transferred to a newly created position at the FBI's Washington headquarters and assigned the task of guarding his country's most sensitive secrets. It was while working in this capacity that a young agent named Eric O'Neill (Phillipe) was assigned the task of keeping tabs on Hanssen by suspicious higher-ups. Later, after being arrested while delivering a cache of secret documents to a "dead drop" spot in a Virginia park, the notorious traitor was arrested and sentenced to life in prison with no chance for parole(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Ewan McGregor and Pierce Brosnan star in Roman Polanski's much lauded adaptation of author Robert Harris's political conspiracy thriller. When the corpse of the man ghost-writing the memoirs of former British Prime Minister Adam Lang is found, apparently having accidentally fallen from a ferry, another writer is quickly hired to finish the job. The new man (McGregor, in an un-named role) is dispatched to the ex-PM's swish home in the States, where he now resides. As the writer begins his task, he thinks it odd that he's not allowed access to his predecessor's draft but gets on with the work, under pressure from all sides to finish the job quickly. But, later, he uncovers documents, seemingly left by the dead man, which throw a new light on everything: they suggest Lang and his wealthy friends have very dark secrets, ones they'd possibly even kill for in order to keep them hidden. Will the new ghost-writer now suffer the same fate as the previous one?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A struggling writer unlocks the full potential of his brain by taking a cutting-edge pharmaceutical, only to find that his newfound abilities have made him a target for some of the most greedy and dangerous men on the planet. Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) is an author without a novel. No matter how hard he tries, he just can't summon the inspiration to write a single word. That all changes when an old friend wanders back into Eddie's life, and opens his eyes to a powerful new drug called NZT. The moment Eddie takes NZT, his brain begins functioning at 100 percent, giving him the ability to quickly recall every event in his life down to the smallest detail, learn new languages in a flash, and harness the untapped power of complex mathematical equations. But when Eddie's supply of NZT runs out, the party is over. Of course, it doesn't take Eddie long to make a mint on Wall Street, and when he does, it draws the attention of Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro), one of the world's most powerful and prominent businessmen. With Eddie's help, Carl plots to arbitrate a complex corporate merger that will shake the establishment to its very core. Just as the deal is about to be brokered, however, some dangerous characters discover Eddie's secret and come gunning for his dwindling supply of medicine. Now, if Eddie can just endure the debilitating side effects of NZT long enough to run for his life, he may just survive to see another day(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">For Love of the Game</title>
    <desc lang="en">Based on the novel by Michael Shaara, For Love of the Game brought Kevin Costner back to the world of baseball after his successes with Bull Durham (1988) and Field of Dreams (1989). Billy Chapel (Kevin Costner) is a star pitcher with the Detroit Tigers, standing on the mound at Yankee Stadium and throwing what is shaping up to be a perfect game with the help of his best friend and catcher, Gus Osinski (John C. Reilly). However, Billy is having a hard time keeping his mind on the game; he's come to a crossroads in both his personal and professional lives, and he isn't sure what to do or where to go. He's learned that the Tigers are about to be sold, and the new owners intend to trade him at the end of the season, and that his girlfriend Jane (Kelly Preston) is planning to leave him. For Love of the Game represents a change of pace for director Sam Raimi, best-known for the Evil Dead trilogy and the acclaimed suspense drama A Simple Plan (1998) (although Raimi, a baseball fan born in Michigan, doubtless enjoyed making a film featuring the Detroit Tigers)(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Dreaming of Joseph Lees</title>
    <desc lang="en">This drama takes place in Somerset, England in 1958. Eva is a twenty-year-old woman who fantasizes about travel, painting, classic books, and the attention of Joseph Lees, her second cousin, with whom she fell in love as a girl. Joseph, whom she has not seen for four years, is the only member of the family who has managed to get away from the stale domestic cycle. He has recently been injured in a truck accident and Eva imagines herself curing his wounds. She conceals her obsession from everyone except her sister, the precocious Janie, who is twelve years old. Reality is far away from Eva's dreams. Her artistic endeavors are confined to a local drawing class; she works for a meager salary at a dirty sawmill and the only male around to appreciate her female charm is the local pig farmer, Harry Flyte. Harry's sister Maria is anxious to marry off her brother so that she can be free to do as she pleases. Eva moves in with Harry, but when she meets Joseph at a family gathering, the old flame is rekindled. However, Harry is not so easy to get rid of. Dreaming of Joseph Lees is a family drama and the first feature of Eric Styles(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Far From Heaven</title>
    <desc lang="en">Maverick director Todd Haynes embraces the look and feel of classic Hollywood melodramas of the 1950s in this period drama. Cathy Whitaker (Julianne Moore) and her husband, Frank (Dennis Quaid), are a seemingly perfect couple; living in a handsome suburban neighborhood in Hartford, CT, in 1957, Cathy and Frank have a beautiful home and two happy, healthy children, while Frank pursues a successful career in sales and Cathy cares for the home. But Cathy has begun to sense something isn't quite right in her marriage, as Frank begins working late, spending less time with her, and seems cold and distant. One day, Cathy visits Frank's work and discovers something she never expected -- her husband is kissing a man. At Cathy's urging, Frank undergoes psychotherapy, but as she tries to keep up a brave face, the emotional trauma takes a great toll on her, and she finds there are very few people she can talk with. Cathy strikes up a friendship with Raymond Deagan (Dennis Haysbert), an African-American gardener who works for the Whitakers, and as she discovers how intelligent and compassionate Raymond is, she finds herself drawn to him. However, Hartford is in many ways still a small town, and when Mona (Celia Weston) sees Cathy and Raymond alone together, it sets off a wave of vicious gossip that threatens to make the Whitakers' many secrets public knowledge. Far from Heaven premiered at the 2002 Venice Film Festival, where Julianne Moore's performance won the prize for Best Actress(n)</desc>

When a rescue ship arrives to transport the colonists back to Earth, everyone rejoices -- everyone but Benteen, who is unwilling to relinquish his self-anointed authority. Written by Rod Serling, "On Thursday We Leave for Home" was the last of the 60-minute Twilight Zone episodes, though not the last one to be telecast.

Making his second appearance on the series, Burgess Meredith stars as Luther Dingle, a mild-mannered salesman whom a pair of Martians select for a most unusual experiment. The aliens endow Dingle with the strength of 300 men, a gift which he eventually abuses and loses. The ending of this one is a beaut. Don Rickles costars as an obnoxious horse player, displaying the same comic invective with which he infested his nightlclub act. Written by Rod Serling, "Mr. Dingle, the Strong" would be remade, after a fashion, as the third-season Twilight Zone entry "Cavender Is Coming."(n)</desc>

Bloom's father is Edward Bloom,an old codger who may be largely benign but is deemed a bullshitter by his son, and a selfish one at that. Edward's endless recounting of yarns about himself has distanced father and son. But when Edward is diagnosed with terminal cancer, William returns to the family home to try and make his peace, and find out who his father really is. Bed-bound, and with an audience of not just the cynical William but also his receptive wife Josephine, Edward recounts his remarkable life in fragments(n)</desc>
