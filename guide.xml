    <desc lang="en">Scientist Mark Evans enlists the aid of an international team of geneticists as he sets out to determine whether there is a rational explanation for the legendary Tibetan yeti. Mark's investigation centres on two competing theories, the first being that the `Abominable Snowman' is in fact a species of `human' marginalised by the rise of homo sapiens, the other stating that the yeti is some form of previously undiscovered bear. Renowned mountaineer Reinhold Messner - who claims to have encountered a yeti - weighs in on the subject, subscribing to the latter theory, while Professor Rasmus Neilsen shares his research into the Denisovans, a long-lost species of human with DNA connections to modern Tibetans, which may have inspired Himalayan folk tales of `wild men' who would later become known as `yetis'.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Good Morning, Vietnam</title>
    <desc lang="en">The film begins in 1965, when disc jockey Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams) is assigned to take over the AFR's Saigon radio broadcasts. In contrast to the dull, by-rote announcers that have preceded him, Cronauer is a bundle of dynamite, heralding each broadcast with a loud "Goooooood morning, Vietnaaaaam," playing whatever records tickle his fancy (even those not officially sanctioned by his hidebound superiors), and indulging in wild flights of improvisational fancy. Cronauer's immediate superior Lt. Hauk (Bruno Kirby), whose own notions of humor are puerile and pathetic, jealously attempts to dethrone Vietnam's favorite rock jock. Fortunately, Cronauer's popularity is such that he enjoys the full protection of the higher-ups. But when Cronauer, after experiencing the horrors of war first-hand, insists upon telling his listeners the truth instead of the official government line, he is instantly replaced by the unfunny Hauk and must struggle to get back on the air(n)</desc>

After running a stop sign in a small town just off the New Jersey turnpike, Chris and his friends are pulled over and arrested by a motorcycle cop named Denis (John Candy). The travellers are brought before J.P. (Aykroyd), the ancient and vindictive Justice of the Peace in the very strange village of Valkevania, where minor traffic offenses are usually punished by torture or death. While Fausto and Renalda are able to escape, Chris and Diane find themselves trapped in a bizarre underground maze in which fellow tourists like themselves must fight for their lives.

    <title lang="en">Phone Booth</title>
    <desc lang="en">One man's life is thrown into turmoil by picking up a telephone in this claustrophobic thriller. Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell) is a brash, cynical, and self-centered public relations man who juggles a busy career with both a wife, Kelly (Radha Mitchell), and a mistress, Pamela (Katie Holmes). Stu steps into a phone booth on a busy New York street to make a call to Pamela without Kelly being the wiser, but as soon as Stu hangs up, the phone begins to ring. Curious, Stu picks it up -- and a stranger on the other end (voice of Kiefer Sutherland) informs him that if he hangs up the phone, he'll be shot. The red dot of an infrared rifle scope convinces Stu that the caller means business, and when another man tries to make his way into the booth, he's shot mere inches from Stu, calling the attention of the police. Captain Ramey (Forest Whitaker) naturally assumes that Stu was the killer, as Stu struggles to find a way to convince the police of what's happening before more lives are lost, without leaving the booth and putting his own life on the line. At one time proposed as a vehicle for Jim Carrey, Phone Booth was directed by Joel Schumacher, from a screenplay by exploitation icon Larry Cohen(n)</desc>

Cronauer's immediate superior Lt. Hauk (Bruno Kirby), whose own notions of humor are puerile and pathetic, jealously attempts to dethrone Vietnam's favorite rock jock. Fortunately, Cronauer's popularity is such that he enjoys the full protection of the higher-ups. But when Cronauer, after experiencing the horrors of war first-hand, insists upon telling his listeners the truth instead of the official government line, he is instantly replaced by the unfunny Hauk and must struggle to get back on the air(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Leicester City v Derby County (Kick-off 7.45pm). Coverage of the fourth-round replay, which takes place at King Power Stadium, with the winners looking to progress to a last-16 tie away to Millwall. The original fixture ended in a 2-2 draw, which saw an astonishing own goal from Darren Bent gift the lead to The Foxes after just eight minutes, before the striker went on to equalise for The Rams 13 minutes later, and go some way toward sparing his blushes. The Championship outfit then took the lead five minutes before half-time courtesy of Craig Bryson, only for the reigning Premier League champions to claim a late second-half equaliser through captain Wes Morgan, setting up this replay.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The ceramicists return to Stoke-on-Trent for week two of the ceramics challenge, with judges Keith Brymer Jones and Kate Malone setting them three more tasks to show who is best at working with clay. They begin by throwing a double-walled pot on the wheel, then for the spot test they have to create handles for a set of casserole dishes. Finally, the main challenge sees them making a large clock, which involves slab rolling large amounts of clay to shape, then raw glazing and firing them to produce what they hope will be beautiful timepieces. But for one hopeful, this will have been their last day in the contest. Host Sara Cox breaks the bad news.(n)</desc>

Born during the chaotic Spring and Autumn period of Chinese history, Confucius believed that harmony could be promoted and achieved through the examples of sage rulers. He was also a innovative teacher, and tried to instill his principles of moral excellence in China's elite, but died without seeing his vision for his nation come to pass. However, his philosophies would eventually form the bedrock of Chinese culture, with many of his principles of tradition surviving to this day.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Mean Girls</title>
    <desc lang="en">Tina Fey from Saturday Night Live wrote and appears in this comedy about the alternately funny and terrifying pecking order among teenage girls. Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan) is a 15-year-old girl who has spent most of her life in Africa, where she was home-schooled by her zoologist parents. When her family relocates to the United States, Cady finds herself attending a high school in suburban Illinois, where she gets a crash course in the various sub-strata of the student body: the jocks, the cheerleaders, the stoners, the "cool" kids, and so on. Much to her surprise, Cady finds herself embraced by a clique of rich and popular girls known to outsiders as "the Plastics," led by Regina George (Rachel McAdams), Gretchen Weiners (Lacey Chabert), and Karen Smith (Amanda Seyfried). While Cady is grateful for her new friends, it doesn't take long for her to realize how manipulative they can be, and she soon discovers she's violated an unwritten law when she goes out on a date with Aaron (Jonathan Bennett), who is charming, good looking...and Regina's former boyfriend. It isn't long before Regina and her pals are on the warpath, and Cady must face a level of vengeful behavior for which years in the jungle never prepared her. Joining Tina Fey in the supporting cast are fellow SNL players Amy Poehler, Ana Gasteyer, and Tim Meadows. The screenplay for Mean Girls was based in part on Queen Bees and Wannabes: Helping Your Daughter Survive Cliques, Gossip, Boyfriends and Other Realities of Adolescence, a book by professional youth counselor Rosalind Wiseman(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Three rich, pretty people befriend their poor, mousy classmate and live to regret it in this teen-centric thriller. Alicia (Mia Kirshner), Hadley (Meredith Monroe), Julianne (Rachel True), and Sydney (Dominique Swain) are four students enrolled in the same sociology class at Colby University, an exclusive and respected college in the Carolinas. Alicia is a local girl born into modest circumstances who struggles to make ends meet and rarely gets a second look from the male students on campus, while Hadley, Julianne, and Sydney are close friends who all come from wealthy families and seem more concerned with partying than their studies. Alicia and Hadley are paired up to work on their semester project for the class, which is to be centered around the theme "Lead, Follow, or Get Out of the Way." As part of the project, Hadley decides to befriend Alicia, and brings her into her social circle. At first, Alicia seems more than grateful for the attention of her new friends, and blooms under the influence of Hadley, Julianne, and Sydney. But it isn't long before Alicia's personality begins to shift; she develops a powerful appetite for drugs and alcohol, and soon begins taking advantage of her new friendships. Things come to a head when Alicia seduces Sydney's boyfriend, Josh (Oliver Hudson), and soon Alicia ends up in the hospital after OD'ing on drugs. Artie Bonner (Taye Diggs), a local sheriff, begins looking into Alicia's case, convinced that her near-fatal accident with drugs was no accident at all(n)</desc>

Rather than continue to fruitlessly question Derek (Livingston) regarding his slew of failed relationships, Stacy sneaks into his Palm Pilot and begins interviewing his ex-girlfriends under the pretense of gathering information for a future show. Though she justifies the deception with her need to find out whether or not Derek can be trusted for a long-term relationship, complications arise when Stacy becomes good friends with one of Derek's former flames. Holly Hunter makes an appearance as Stacy's boss (the show's senior associate producer), while Josie Maran, Julianne Nicholson, Rashida Jones, Sharon Lawrence, and Bush frontman Gavin Rossdale are featured in supporting roles(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This blend of sports and youthful romantic comedy is from director Michael Tollin, who previously produced the sports drama Varsity Blues (1999). Freddie Prinze Jr. stars as Ryan Dunne, a ballplayer who's spending the summer as a pitcher for the famed, highly prestigious Cape Cod League, a non-professional farm team that has turned out numerous baseball legends. Ryan's under special pressure on a number of fronts. He's the first local boy to earn a slot in the league in years, and his blue-collar status earns him the enmity of a hot-shot college teammate, Eric Van Leemer (Corey Pearson). Although he's backed up by his best friend and team catcher Billy Brubaker (Matthew Lillard), Ryan adds more stress to his life by embarking on an affair with a beautiful, wealthy young Vassar graduate, Tenley Parrish (Jessica Biel), who's spending the summer on the Cape with her parents. Tenley is facing her own crisis as her father (Bruce Davison) pressures her to move to San Francisco and work with her uncle, though she'd rather remain in the East and become an architect. Summer Catch is the third onscreen teaming of Prinze and Lillard, and also stars Brian Dennehy, Wilmer Valderrama, Jason Gedrick, Fred Ward, and Brittany Murphy(n)</desc>

Freddie Prinze Jr. stars as Ryan Dunne, a ballplayer who's spending the summer as a pitcher for the famed, highly prestigious Cape Cod League, a non-professional farm team that has turned out numerous baseball legends. Ryan's under special pressure on a number of fronts. He's the first local boy to earn a slot in the league in years, and his blue-collar status earns him the enmity of a hot-shot college teammate, Eric Van Leemer (Corey Pearson). Although he's backed up by his best friend and team catcher Billy Brubaker (Matthew Lillard), Ryan adds more stress to his life by embarking on an affair with a beautiful, wealthy young Vassar graduate, Tenley Parrish (Jessica Biel), who's spending the summer on the Cape with her parents. Tenley is facing her own crisis as her father (Bruce Davison) pressures her to move to San Francisco and work with her uncle, though she'd rather remain in the East and become an architect. Summer Catch is the third onscreen teaming of Prinze and Lillard, and also stars Brian Dennehy, Wilmer Valderrama, Jason Gedrick, Fred Ward, and Brittany Murphy(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Miami Rhapsody</title>
    <desc lang="en">The discovery of marital troubles in her family causes a young woman to question her own upcoming nuptials in this clever romantic comedy. Sarah Jessica Parker stars as Gwyn, a bright, slightly neurotic advertising copywriter who is initially thrilled when her boyfriend Matt (Gil Bellows) finally proposes. Soon afterwards, however, she learns that her mother Nina (Mia Farrow) is indulging in an extra-marital affair with a handsome Latin stud (Antonio Banderas). This is only the first of several shocking revelations, as Gwyn soon learns of infidelity by her father (Paul Mazursky), brother (Kevin Pollack), and even newlywed sister (Carla Gugino). These indiscretions make Gwyn question the validity of the entire institution of marriage and doubt her own future. Director David Frankel, who also penned the screenplay, follows in the footsteps of Woody Allen in using introspective dialogue to detail the romantic troubles of a wealthy, neurotic Jewish family; practiced performances and a colorful use of Miami locations give the film its own personality(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A political consultant in the midst of a bitter divorce attempts to delicately divulge the truth about his past relationships to his curious young daughter, who simply won't stop asking questions until she's satisfied with all the answers. Ten-year-old Maya (Abigail Breslin) is heartbroken to see her parents splitting up, but she's determined to find out precisely how it was that mom and dad came together in the first place. When Maya starts questioning her father Will (Ryan Reynolds) about his life before marriage, dad's memories soon drift back to the time when, as a naïve Wisconsin native and aspiring politician hoping to work on the presidential election, he first arrived in New York City. As Will gradually became savvy to the ways of the big city, he gradually developed romantic relationships with three very different women: Emily (Elizabeth Banks) was the girl-next-door that he could always depend on, apolitical April (Isla Fisher) was the best friend and confidante who was always there to listen, and free-spirited journalist Summer (Rachel Weisz) was both beautiful and ambitious. In order to prevent his perceptive little girl from predicting the outcome before his story is told, Will carefully changes the names of his three romantic interests, creating a hopelessly romantic puzzle that highlights both the joys and hardships of true love(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A political consultant in the midst of a bitter divorce attempts to delicately divulge the truth about his past relationships to his curious young daughter, who simply won't stop asking questions until she's satisfied with all the answers. Ten-year-old Maya (Abigail Breslin) is heartbroken to see her parents splitting up, but she's determined to find out precisely how it was that mom and dad came together in the first place. When Maya starts questioning her father Will (Ryan Reynolds) about his life before marriage, dad's memories soon drift back to the time when, as a naïve Wisconsin native and aspiring politician hoping to work on the presidential election, he first arrived in New York City. As Will gradually became savvy to the ways of the big city, he gradually developed romantic relationships with three very different women: Emily (Elizabeth Banks) was the girl-next-door that he could always depend on, apolitical April (Isla Fisher) was the best friend and confidante who was always there to listen, and free-spirited journalist Summer (Rachel Weisz) was both beautiful and ambitious. In order to prevent his perceptive little girl from predicting the outcome before his story is told, Will carefully changes the names of his three romantic interests, creating a hopelessly romantic puzzle that highlights both the joys and hardships of true love(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">(2005) Jean-François Richet's remake of John Carpenter's 1976 cult classic rivals the original for tension and action. Ethan Hawke plays Jake Roenick, a police sergeant in charge of closing down defunct cop shop Precinct 13 with old timer Jasper O'Shea (Brian Dennehy) and secretary Iris Ferry (Drea de Matteo). But a bus taking drugs lord Marion Bishop (Laurence Fishburne) to prison is caught up in traffic chaos and he and the other prisoners are dumped on Roenick and his team. Bishop is due to give evidence that would expose cop corruption at the highest level and when Marcus Duvall (Gabriel Byrne), one of those under threat, finds out where Bishop is being held, he gathers a gang to take him out.

    <title lang="en">Broken Arrow</title>
    <desc lang="en">John Woo brought all his Hong Kong martial arts movie knowledge to this film and it positively jumps off the screen. John Travolta plays air force pilot Major VIc 'Deak' Deakins, Christian Slater his number two, Captain Riley Hale. Deakins, a traitor, crashes their Stealth bomber, steals the nuclear warheads and sets off to meet his terrorist masters. Hale pursues him, helped by glamorous park ranger Terry Carmichael and, of course, is assumed by the authorities to be in on the plot. Cue car chases, fights on moving (and burning) trains, gunfights galore and the constant threat of the weapons exploding en route. The sheer breakneck action makes it one of the better Hollywood blockbusters of its time and Travolta's rehabilitation as an actor wasn't hurt by his amoral villain(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Rookie of the Year</title>
    <desc lang="en">Rookie of the Year is a light-hearted comedy about a 12-year-old baseball fan who, despite his love for the sport, can't play the game at all. During one Little League contest, he breaks his arm. After it heals, it miraculously becomes a super-human arm that can out-pitch any player in the major leagues. The boy joins the Chicago Cubs and helps lead them to the World Series. Though the plot is silly and contrived, it's a pleasant film that is ideal for young sports fans(n)</desc>

An investigation into police corruption has led Avila and his partner, Sgt. Amy Wallace (Laurie Metcalf), to Officer Dennis Peck (Richard Gere). Avila suspects something about Peck from the beginning; his influence and dominance over others seems to extend further than the reach of his badge. When officers who wish to testify against Peck start dying, the depth of his corruption becomes increasingly clear; at his disposal, he has an army of cops and criminals alike. He even agrees to assassinate a sleazy businessman's own parents, and humiliates the businessman while they make the deal. In his drive to dominate others, Peck attempts to seduce almost every woman around him and is obsessed with children and fatherhood. Peck is most dangerous when the investigation threatens his territory and his extended family; he stalks Avila and turns him against his wife (Nancy Travis)(n)</desc>

The Original Kings of Comedy captures the tour's rough and raunchy humor on film.

    <title lang="en">The Hurt Locker</title>
    <desc lang="en">Kathryn Bigelow's compelling fact-based, Iraq-set bomb disposal drama was scripted by journalist Mark Boal, drawing on his experiences while embedded with a United States Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal team in 2004. The focus is on the complex characters making up Bravo Company, who disable and destroy improvised explosive devices. The days are ticking down to the end of the bomb squad's tour, but their role puts the team in harm's way around the clock. And it doesn't help that one of the team is addicted to risk taking and pays scant attention to standard procedure, putting other lives in danger, as well as his own. The Hurt Locker provides a tense glimpse into the lives of these extraordinary men, and also probes the various psychologies of people whose job could kill them at any moment, as well as - briefly - exploring how they cope once away from their adrenaline-soaked vocation(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In 1997, four of America's leading African-American stand-up comedians -- Steve Harvey, D.L. Hughley, Bernie Mac, and Cedric The Entertainer -- joined forces for a concert tour that became one of the top money-earning attractions of recent years, consistently selling out 10,000 to 15,000 seat arenas from coast to coast. The Original Kings of Comedy captures the tour's rough and raunchy humor on film. The concert documentary was shot in February of 2000 during a two-night stand in Charlotte, North Carolina (which was the site of the tour's first date three years earlier).

    <desc lang="en">Kathryn Bigelow's compelling fact-based, Iraq-set bomb disposal drama was scripted by journalist Mark Boal, drawing on his experiences while embedded with a United States Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal team in 2004. The focus is on the complex characters making up Bravo Company, who disable and destroy improvised explosive devices. The days are ticking down to the end of the bomb squad's tour, but their role puts the team in harm's way around the clock. And it doesn't help that one of the team is addicted to risk taking and pays scant attention to standard procedure, putting other lives in danger, as well as his own. The Hurt Locker provides a tense glimpse into the lives of these extraordinary men, and also probes the various psychologies of people whose job could kill them at any moment, as well as - briefly - exploring how they cope once away from their adrenaline-soaked vocation(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Hills Have Eyes</title>
    <desc lang="en">Horror auteur Wes Craven followed his threadbare but horrifically compelling cult classic Last House on the Left with this wonderfully demented morality fable about a bloody war of attrition between two extremely different families. The story opens on the journey of the Carters, a mildly dysfunctional extended family led by patriarch "Big Bob" Carter (Russ Grieve), as they travel across the California desert in search of an inherited silver mine. When a broken axle leaves them stranded in the middle of a former nuclear testing site, their attempts to find help lead them unwittingly into the territory of a savage family of cave-dwelling cannibals, the apparent progeny of the bearlike Jupiter (James Whitworth) and an abducted prostitute. Jupiter's eldest son Pluto (professional movie weirdo Michael Berryman) leads the first brutal attack on the defenseless Carters who, through necessity, are driven to equally extreme measures in order to survive. Though the film is not overtly bloody, the scenes depicting this confrontation are rendered with an unflinching directness, and the violations visited on the Carters are so brutal as to make the survivors' regression into savagery all the more convincing. No one is spared from the nightmare: Jupiter's boys have even kidnapped the youngest member of the Carter family -- a mere infant -- to serve as fodder for their next barbecue, and the baby becomes the main point of contention between the rival clans.

A "fairy godmother" in the shape of Leonardo da Vinci eventually smoothes the path of true love but, thanks to Barrymore, this is not another soft retelling of Cinderella but a punchy, energetic film with Barrymore in excellent form as the forthright Danielle(n)</desc>

A "fairy godmother" in the shape of Leonardo da Vinci eventually smoothes the path of true love but, thanks to Barrymore, this is not another soft retelling of Cinderella but a punchy, energetic film with Barrymore in excellent form as the forthright Danielle(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A widowed Englishman working in Denmark and a Danish hairdresser who's been left by her husband forge a fragile romance during a trip to Italy to see their son and daughter get married. Philip (Pierce Brosnan) is a stern businessman who hates living in Denmark, and hasn't seen his son Patrick (Sebastian Jessen) in years. He's in a race to Patrick's wedding in Italy when he has a chance run-in with Ida (Trine Dyrholm) who's recovering from successful chemotherapy treatments when she learns that her husband Leif (Kim Bodnia) has been sleeping with a younger woman. Ida also happens to be the mother of Astrid (Molly Blixt Egelind), Patrick's beautiful bride-to-be. Though initially Philip and Ida appear to have nothing in common, their shared recognition that their children's union may be in trouble before the wedding bells have started to chime leads to an unexpected connection, and a second chance at happiness as they work to set things right.

Something deep within Sam begins to stir however, when he discovers his late son's demo tapes, and decides to take a listen. Deeply moved by his son's artistry and determined not to let the boy's dreams die with him, Sam determines to learn each song note-for-note, and later summons the courage to perform one of them publicly. That performance, in turn, prompts aspiring musician Quentin (Anton Yelchin) to approach Sam, and together they form a band that transforms their lives in ways neither ever dreamt possible.

    <desc lang="en">When a powerful man is accused of murder, who tells the truth -- the man, or his estranged wife? Henry Hearst (Gene Hackman), an American attorney living in Puerto Rico, is called in to speak with police detective Victor Benezet (Morgan Freeman). A few days earlier, Hearst reported finding the body of a 12-year-old girl while taking his dog for a walk; however, investigators now believe that Hearst may have had a greater involvement in the crime than he's admitting. Under intense questioning by a confident young cop named Owens (Thomas Jane) and gentler but firm interrogation from Benezet, several cracks begin to appear in Hearst's story, but he's able to persuade the police to allow him to leave long enough to take part in a fund-raising function he'd promised to attend. However, upon his return, Hearst discovers that Benezet and Owens have been questioning someone else -- his wife Chantal (Monica Bellucci), who has been on poor terms with her husband for some time. Under Suspicion was based on the novel Brainwash by John Wainwright, which was previously filmed by French director Claude Miller as Garde a vue(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Two relative strangers try to turn a one night stand into a marriage in this romantic comedy. Alex Whitman (Matthew Perry) is a designer from New York City who is sent to Las Vegas to supervise the construction of a nightclub that his firm has been hired to build. Alex is a straight-laced WASP-ish type who, while enjoying a night on the town, meets Isabel Fuentes (Salma Hayek), a free-spirited Mexican-American photographer. Alex and Isabel are overtaken by lust at first sight and end up spending the night together; however, their immediate attraction doesn't last in the cold light of day, and they don't see each other for another three months. When they do meet again, it's because Isabel has some interesting news for Alex: she's pregnant with his child. Alex and Isabel decide that they should do the right thing and quickly get married (with an Elvis impersonator serving as witness), but after Isabel meets Alex's mom (Jill Clayburgh), and Alex is confronted by Isabel's father (Tomas Milian), both start to wonder if "doing the right thing" was just that, especially as Alex tries to balance his career in New York with Isabel's desire to continue working in Nevada. Fools Rush In gave Matthew Perry his first big-screen starring role following his success on the TV series Friends(n)</desc>

F/X technician Patrick Tatopoulos (Godzilla, Independence Day) steps out of the effects lab and into the director's chair with this entry, which sees stars Bill Nighy returning as Viktor, the king of his vampire clan and father to Sonja (Rhona Mitra), a free-minded heir who tests her parent by heading outside of their castle's borders and doing battle with the ravenous werewolves of the surrounding area. Sonja also has a secret love affair with Lucian (Michael Sheen), the first of the Lycans, a race of lycanthropes who were bred by the vampires to be slaves and protectors to the bloodsucking clan. As the news of their love spreads to Viktor, ranks of the vampire elite help Lucian escape, leading to a revolution of the Lycans against their masters and setting up the mythology of the later latexed adventures featured in Len Wiseman's two previous films(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A paraplegic ex-marine finds a new life on the distant planet of Pandora, only to find himself battling humankind alongside the planet's indigenous Na'vi race in this ambitious digital 3D sci-fi epic from Academy Award-winning Titanic director James Cameron. The film, which marks Cameron's first dramatic feature since 1997's Titanic, follows Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a war veteran who gets called to the depths of space to pick up the job of his slain twin brother for the scientific arm of a megacorporation looking to mine the planet of Pandora for a valued ore. Unfortunately the biggest deposit of the prized substance lies underneath the home of the Na'vi, a ten-foot-tall, blue-skinned native tribe who have been at war with the security arm of the company, lead by Col. Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang). Because of the planet's hostile atmosphere, humans have genetically grown half-alien/half-human bodies which they can jack their consciousnesses into and explore the world in. Since Jake's brother already had an incredibly expensive Avatar grown for him, he's able to connect with it using the same DNA code and experience first-hand the joys of Pandora while giving the scientific team, led by Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) and Norm Spellman (Joel David Moore), some well-needed protection against the planet's more hostile forces. On a chance meeting after getting separated from his team, Jake's Avatar is rescued by Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), a Na'vi princess, who brings him into her tribe in order to give the humans a second chance at relating to this new environment. When word gets out of his increasing time with the alien species, Quaritch enlists Jake to do some reconnaissance for the company, as they'd like to persuade the tribe to move their home before taking more drastic measures to harness the treasure hidden below. Yet as Jake becomes one with the tribe and begins to understand the secrets of Pandora, his conscience is torn between his new adopted world and the wheelchair-bound one awaiting him when the psychic connection to his Avatar is broken. Soon battle lines are drawn and Jake needs to decide which side he will fight on when the time comes. The film was shot on the proprietary FUSION digital 3D cameras developed by Cameron in collaboration with Vince Pace, and offers a groundbreaking mix of live-action dramatic performances and computer-generated effects. The revolutionary motion-capture system created for the film allows the facial expressions of actors to be captured as a virtual camera system enables them to see what their computer-generated counterparts will be seeing in the film, and Peter Jackson's Oscar-winning Weta Digital visual-effects house supervises Avatar's complex special effects(n)</desc>

The punchline of this episode will be amusing only to those who lived through the darkest days of the Cold War (though a passing reference to "Jack Kennedy" has been excised from most existing prints). Future Laugh-In regular Arte Johnson appears as Hunnicutt's long-suffering assistant.

    <desc lang="en">The Invaders. Written by Richard Matheson, this is one of those classic Twilight Zone episodes that has remained in the collective memory long after other lesser episodes (and lesser anthologies) have been forgotten. The action takes place at a remote farmhouse, where a soil-stained farm woman (Agnes Moorehead) is forced to defend herself from a tiny spaceship and its equally diminutive occupants. Except for the final scene, the episode is entirely bereft of dialogue, affording Moorehead the opportunity to deliver a bravura pantomime performance. Originally telecast January 27, 1961, "The Invaders" was selected as the final Twilight Zone rerun of the 1961-62 season -- which at the time was assumed to be the series' very last installment(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The One with Two Parts. This episode marks the first appearance of Phoebe's (Lisa Kudrow) twin sister, Ursula (also played by Kudrow), who is the exact opposite of the considerate and peace-loving Phoebe. Joey starts to date Ursula, which annoys Phoebe because she doesn't get along with her sister. Meanwhile, Ross (David Schwimmer) attends Lamaze class with Susan (Jessica Hecht) and Carol (Jane Sibbett). As Carol voices her anxiety about going through with the pregnancy, Ross also begins to come to terms with his role as a father; much humor is made over who gets to play the father role in the class exercises. Across town, Chandler (Matthew Perry) is dating Nina (Jennifer Grant), an employee he cannot bring himself to fire -- instead, he tells the other office workers that she is insane and too imbalanced to let go. When Nina asks why her co-workers are avoiding her, Chandler says that perhaps they are jealous of their relationship. After Marcel, Ross' monkey, changes Monica's (Courteney Cox) TV to Spanish mode, the gang sits around and watches it. This leads Joey to make the astute observation that "Urkel" is spelled the same way in Spanish as it is in English. Helen Hunt and Leila Kenzle show up at Central Perk as Jamie and Fran, their characters from Mad About You. This episode is part one of a two-part episode that originally aired on February 23, 1995(n)</desc>
