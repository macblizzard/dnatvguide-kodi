Elsewhere, officers are confronted by an army of family and friends when they attempt to enforce a writ at the property of a debtor, and face a difficult eviction at the north London home of a heavily pregnant tenant and her family, after the council fails to pay the rent to the landlord.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Presumed Innocent, a murder mystery, based on a novel by Scott Turow, and well directed by Alan J. Pakula, tells the story of prosecutor Rusty Sabich (Harrison Ford) who is accused of murdering his mistress Caroline (Greta Scacchi) and must prove his innocence. Sabich, a successful prosecutor, whose marriage is shaken by his wife Barbara's (Bonnie Bedelia) discovery of his affair, finds himself in a nightmare when his former mistress is found dead and all the physical evidence points to him; even his wife seems to believe that he is guilty. Ford is excellent in his role as Sabich, convincing both as an attorney and as a man who wants to take his formerly happy life back. Bonnie Bedelia is wonderful as Sabich's unforgiving wife, and gives a compelling, enigmatic performance in a difficult role. Presumed Innocent both a plausible, believable courtroom drama and an exciting murder mystery is highly recommended(n)</desc>

In the early 1980s, a hastily assembled army of Afghan "freedom fighters" achieved the remarkable feat of fending off Soviet invaders despite the fact that the odds were overwhelmingly stacked against them. At the time, Texas congressman Charlie Wilson (Hanks) was a key member of the hugely powerful House Appropriations Committee. Illuminated to the specifics of this remarkable war by a high-profile Houston socialite, Wilson spearheaded an effort to provide hundreds of millions of dollars in weapons and training to the Mujahideen with more than a little help from brilliant but prickly CIA operative Gust Avrokotos(n)</desc>

Back in her teens, Marni (Bell) was a little awkward. These days she's a successful career woman, but the memories of being tormented by popular cheerleader Joanna (Yustman) still make her break into a cold sweat. Flying home for her brother's Will's wedding, Marni realizes to her horror that she will soon be sister-in-law to the pompon-wielding mean girl who once humiliated her in front of the entire student body. And apparently her nemesis learned from the best, because back when Marni's mom (Jamie Lee Curtis) was in high school, Joanna's aunt (Sigourney Weaver) served up the same kind of treatment. Now that they're about to become family, Marni and her mom do their best to let bygones be bygones. But old grudges die hard, and by the time the wedding bells chime, these old foes will already have some saucy stories to share with their grandchildren(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Writer/director Victor Salva returns to his horror roots with this teen-slasher genre flick, one of several 2001 films produced by Francis Ford Coppola's American Zoetrope studio. Gina Philips and Justin Long are siblings Trish and Darry, road tripping home from college across the U.S. and bickering all the way. Menaced by a truck on the highway, the travelers encounter the same vehicle later, and what they believe is a man dumping a human body into a drainage pipe. Investigating, Darry and Trish become the intended prey of an indestructible, supernatural creature hell-bent on eating them, a murderous local myth that is proving to be all too real. As they attempt to escape their bloodthirsty pursuer, the pair discovers that even the local police station is no refuge; they also receive some advice from a knowledgeable psychic (Patricia Belcher). Jeepers Creepers co-stars Eileen Brennan(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Katie Derham makes use of archive footage and family records to tell the story of how Vera Lynn came to become one of the UK's most well-known musical stars. Vera celebrates her 100th birthday on March 20th, and marks the occasion by reminiscing about her early days in showbusiness, with help from her daughter Virginia. She recalls starting out as Vera Welch in the 1920s, first appearing on stage at the tender age of seven, before charming the nation's servicemen and becoming the `forces sweetheart' during the Second World War. She also remembers becoming the first British artist to achieve a number one in America in the 1950s, and a similar feat in 2009, when she became the oldest living singer to reach the same position in the UK charts. Along the way, Second World War veterans and entertainment industry figures - including Paul McCartney, Barry Humphries and Miriam Margolyes - pay tribute to the power of her voice.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Although it is closed and secretive, Buckingham Palace has become a symbol of everything British, despite only being a royal palace for less that 200 years. This second of two programmes reflects on previous monarchs' accomplishments during their reign, from Edward VII's commitment in 1901 to making the palace a royal stage, to George V's decision to change the family name from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to Windsor. Finally, the programme considers the next King, who could bring about another revolution at the palace and change its role further in the future.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The countdown of memorable moments from the comedy scene draws to a close, with examples from both sides of the Atlantic. Highlighted are the launches of the raucous 1980s student sitcom The Young Ones and the satirical puppet show Spitting Image, the controversy surrounding Monty Python's Life of Brian, and the much deplored `Sachsgate' scandal of 2008, which saw the tide of public opinion turn against popular BBC presenters Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross after they played an ill-conceived prank on Fawlty Towers star Andrew Sachs live on air on Radio 2. The show also highlights more poignant moments, including Joan Rivers' trail-blazing debut on The Tonight Show back in 1965, and Tommy Cooper's death while live on stage in 1985. Featuring David Baddiel, Keith Allen, Jim Davidson, Jenny Eclair and Nina Wadia.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Ring</title>
    <desc lang="en">A disturbing videotape appears to hold the power of life and death over those who view it in this offbeat thriller. A strange videotape begins making the rounds in a town in the Pacific Northwest; it is full of bizarre and haunting images, and after watching it, many viewers receive a telephone call in which they are warned they will die in seven days. A handful of teenagers who watched the tape while spending a weekend at a cabin in the mountains scoff at the threat, but as predicted, they all die suddenly on the same night. Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts), the aunt of one of the ill-fated teens, is a journalist who has decided to investigate the matter and travels West with her young son, Aidan (David Dorfman), a troubled child who has been drawing pictures of strange and ominous visions. Rachel managed to find the cabin in the woods and watches the video herself; afterward, she receives the same phone call, and realizes she must solve the puzzle of the video and the person or persons behind it within a week. Rachel turns to her ex, Noah (Martin Henderson), an expert in video technology, who at first is convinced the story is a hoax until he digs deeper into the mystery. The Ring was adapted from a 1996 Japanese film by Hideo Nakata, which became a massive box-office success in Asia and spawned two sequels(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Capote</title>
    <desc lang="en">The creation of one of the most memorable books of the 1960s -- and the impact the writing and research would have on its author -- is explored in this drama based on a true story. In 1959, Truman Capote (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman) was a critically acclaimed novelist who had earned a small degree of celebrity for his work when he read a short newspaper item about a multiple murder in a small Kansas town. For some reason, the story fascinated Capote, and he asked William Shawn (Bob Balaban), his editor at The New Yorker, to let him write a piece about the case. Capote had long believed that in the right hands, a true story could be molded into a tale as compelling as any fiction, and he believed this event, in which the brutal and unimaginable was visited upon a community where it was least expected, could be just the right material. Capote traveled to Kansas with his close friend Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), herself becoming a major literary figure with the success of To Kill a Mockingbird, and while Capote's effete and mannered personal style stuck out like a sore thumb in Kansas, in time he gained the trust of Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper), the Kansas Bureau of Investigation agent investigating the murder of the Clutter family, and with his help Capote's magazine piece grew into a full-length book. Capote also became familiar with the petty criminals who killed the Clutter family, Dick Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) and Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.), and in Smith he found a troubling kindred spirit more like himself than he wanted to admit. After attaining a sort of friendship with Smith under the assumption that the man would be executed before the book was ever published, Capote finds himself forced to directly confront the moral implications of his actions with regards to both his role in the man's death, and the way that he would be remembered. Capote also co-stars Bruce Greenwood as Capote's longtime companion Jack Dunphy, and Amy Ryan as Mary Dewey, Alvin's wife who became a confidante of Capote's(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Ring</title>
    <desc lang="en">A disturbing videotape appears to hold the power of life and death over those who view it in this offbeat thriller. A strange videotape begins making the rounds in a town in the Pacific Northwest; it is full of bizarre and haunting images, and after watching it, many viewers receive a telephone call in which they are warned they will die in seven days. A handful of teenagers who watched the tape while spending a weekend at a cabin in the mountains scoff at the threat, but as predicted, they all die suddenly on the same night. Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts), the aunt of one of the ill-fated teens, is a journalist who has decided to investigate the matter and travels West with her young son, Aidan (David Dorfman), a troubled child who has been drawing pictures of strange and ominous visions. Rachel managed to find the cabin in the woods and watches the video herself; afterward, she receives the same phone call, and realizes she must solve the puzzle of the video and the person or persons behind it within a week. Rachel turns to her ex, Noah (Martin Henderson), an expert in video technology, who at first is convinced the story is a hoax until he digs deeper into the mystery. The Ring was adapted from a 1996 Japanese film by Hideo Nakata, which became a massive box-office success in Asia and spawned two sequels(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Capote</title>
    <desc lang="en">The creation of one of the most memorable books of the 1960s -- and the impact the writing and research would have on its author -- is explored in this drama based on a true story. In 1959, Truman Capote (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman) was a critically acclaimed novelist who had earned a small degree of celebrity for his work when he read a short newspaper item about a multiple murder in a small Kansas town. For some reason, the story fascinated Capote, and he asked William Shawn (Bob Balaban), his editor at The New Yorker, to let him write a piece about the case. Capote had long believed that in the right hands, a true story could be molded into a tale as compelling as any fiction, and he believed this event, in which the brutal and unimaginable was visited upon a community where it was least expected, could be just the right material. Capote traveled to Kansas with his close friend Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), herself becoming a major literary figure with the success of To Kill a Mockingbird, and while Capote's effete and mannered personal style stuck out like a sore thumb in Kansas, in time he gained the trust of Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper), the Kansas Bureau of Investigation agent investigating the murder of the Clutter family, and with his help Capote's magazine piece grew into a full-length book. Capote also became familiar with the petty criminals who killed the Clutter family, Dick Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) and Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.), and in Smith he found a troubling kindred spirit more like himself than he wanted to admit. After attaining a sort of friendship with Smith under the assumption that the man would be executed before the book was ever published, Capote finds himself forced to directly confront the moral implications of his actions with regards to both his role in the man's death, and the way that he would be remembered. Capote also co-stars Bruce Greenwood as Capote's longtime companion Jack Dunphy, and Amy Ryan as Mary Dewey, Alvin's wife who became a confidante of Capote's(n)</desc>

Jeremy also visits Belgium, putting the McLaren P1 hypercar to the test in Bruges and around the Spa-Francorchamps Formula One circuit - and its combined power output of more than 900bhp generated from electricity and turbocharged petrol V8 power is likely to cause astonishment. Meanwhile, James May spends time at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan to learn about the army's vehicle redeployment efforts, and Thor star Tom Hiddleston tries to coax the best time he can muster from the Reasonably Priced Car.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Rocky V</title>
    <desc lang="en">Touted upon its release as the finale of the Rocky saga, this fifth entry in the long-running series of sports dramas reunites star Sylvester Stallone with John G. Avildsen, director of the Oscar-winning original. Stallone is Rocky Balboa, suffering from career-ending brain damage as a result of his punishing bout with Ivan Drago at the finale of the previous film. Upon their return to Philadelphia, Rocky and his wife, Adrian (Talia Shire), discover they are broke, their fortune squandered by an incompetent accountant. Forced to move back to their working-class neighborhood, Rocky finds that his only asset is the run-down gym willed to him by Mickey (Burgess Meredith, who appears in new flashback sequences). Resisting big money offered to him by Don King-like boxing promoter George Washington Duke (Richard Gant), Rocky becomes a trainer and finds a talented comer in Tommy Gunn (real-life boxer Tommy Morrison, nephew of John Wayne). Rocky's son (played by Stallone's real-life son Sage Stallone) feels neglected by his father, who lavishes attention on his protégé, but Tommy ultimately turns his back on his mentor to sign a more lucrative deal with Duke, leading to a street-fight showdown(n)</desc>

In 1875, after the Civil War, Leander McNelly (Dylan McDermott) organizes the Texas Rangers to battle the outlaws terrorizing Texas, notably crime kingpin John King Fisher (Alfred Molina).

    <title lang="en">Mona Lisa Smile</title>
    <desc lang="en">Set in 1953, Mona Lisa Smile tells the story of Katherine Watson (Julia Roberts), a new young art history professor at Wellesley College, an all-female campus with a prestigious reputation for academic excellence. Unfortunately for free-minded Berkeley grad Watson, her East Coast teaching stint comes during a less-progressive time that finds most of her students -- among them Betty Warren (Kirsten Dunst), Joan Brandwyn (Julia Stiles), and Giselle Levy (Maggie Gyllenhaal) -- more interested in nabbing a good husband than achieving scholastic and intellectual growth. Watson challenges her students and the Wellesley faculty to think outside of the current mores of the community and redefine what it means to be a success; meanwhile, she tries to come to terms with her own heart's desires. Mona Lisa Smile co-stars Marcia Gay Harden, Juliet Stevenson, and, as Watson's conflicting love interests, Dominic West and John Slattery(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Homer Badman. When the annual Candy Industry Trade Show comes to Springfield, noted sugar enthusiast Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) arrives to load up on free samples, with his embarrassed wife, Marge (voice of Julie Kavner), in tow. Homer's feeble willpower is quickly stretched to the breaking point, and he swipes the rarest item at the show -- a gummy Venus de Milo, "carved by gummy artisans who work exclusively in the medium of gummy." After arriving home from the show, Marge asks Homer to give the babysitter, feminist-minded college student Ashley Grant (voice of Pamela Hayden), a ride home. As Ashley is getting out of the car, Homer notices the precious gummy Venus de Milo is stuck to her bottom, and he quickly peels it off; Ashley is certain Homer was making a sexual advance, and accuses him of harassment. As Ashley and a group of protesters set up camp on the Simpsons' front lawn, a tabloid TV reporter interviews Homer, and through the magic of editing makes him sound like a subnormal degenerate, so suddenly Homer is the pariah of the community. "Homer Badman" also features the voice of Dennis Franz, who stars in a quickie TV movie modeled after Homer's notoriety, "Homer S.: Portrait of an Ass-Grabber." The episode first aired on November 24, 1994(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Lady in the Water director M.

Philadelphia high-school science teacher Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) is discussing the disappearance of the bees with his students when the staff is summoned to the theater and briefed about a mysterious event that is currently unfolding in New York City. According to reports, citizens in the vicinity of Central Park have suddenly and inexplicably begun seizing up just before killing themselves by whatever means are at their disposal. As the phenomena begins to spread and talk of terrorism fills the airwaves, Elliot, his wife, Alma (Zooey Deschanel), their friend Julian (John Leguizamo), and his daughter, Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez), board a train bound for the presumed safety of the country. When the train screeches to a halt before arriving at its final destination, however, the frightened passengers are forced to fend for themselves as each consecutive news report paints an increasingly grim picture of the situation in more urbanized areas. Theories abound on what could be causing the unexplainable rash of suicides, but the only thing that everyone seems to agree on is that it's some kind of airborne contagion that is carried in the wind. It would appear that humankind's reign on planet Earth has come to an end, but perhaps if this small band of survivors can find a safe place to lie low until this all blows over, all hope for survival of the species might not be lost just yet(n)</desc>

Mia Thermopolis is a pleasant, if slightly awkward and geeky, 15-year-old high school student living in San Francisco. She's not the most popular pupil at school, and is regularly picked on by the cheerleader clique. However, all that could be about to change: after her estranged father dies, it's discovered that she's directly in line to the throne of a tiny European country. But first she must show she has the bearing and beauty necessary for the role - and her grandmother Queen Clarisse Renaldi's first impressions are far from positive. Can Mia prove her regal relative wrong?(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl</title>
    <desc lang="en">Writer and director Robert Rodriguez returns to the family-friendly adventure of his Spy Kids movies with this three-dimensional action opus. Max (Cayden Boyd) is a ten-year-old boy who doesn't get along with his peers and is constantly bullied at school. But Max has an active imagination, and he has a pair of very special imaginary playmates -- Shark Boy (Taylor Lautner), a human-shark half-breed cared for by a pack of great whites, and Lava Girl (Taylor Dooley), a girl with superpowers who can conjure heat and fire at will. Max may be a creative boy, but what he doesn't know is that Shark Boy and Lava Girl really do exist, and he is recruited to help them as they do battle against Mr. Electricity, a super-villain determined to deprive children of their sleep. Shot and originally released in the 3-D format, The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl also stars David Arquette and Kristin Davis as Max's parents, and George Lopez as a schoolteacher; writer and director Rodriguez wrote the film's story in collaboration with his then seven-year-old son, Racer Rodriguez(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Slumdog Millionaire</title>
    <desc lang="en">(2008) Danny Boyle's eight Oscar- and seven BAFTA-winning blockbuster opens as Jamal Malik (Dev Patel), a chaiwalah at a call centre, is on the verge of winning 20 million rupees on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? . But the host of the show, Prem Kumar (Anil Kapoor) is convinced he's cheating and hands him over to the police to beat the truth out of him. Jamal reveals that the right answer to each question has come from a significant part of his life, from when he and his brother Salim were orphaned after their mother was killed in religious violence. As he continues his story, Jamal reveals how he knows each answer; how he fell in love with Latika, an orphaned girl from whom he was later separated; and how his brother Salim took the path of violence as a gangster's gunman. But as Jamal is returned to the studio for the last question, Salim finally repays his brother's trust. As well as the outstanding Patel, Jamal is played in different stages of his life by Tanay Hemant Gharu and Ayush Mahesh Khedekar; Salim is played by Madhur Mittal, Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala and Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail; Latika is played by Frieda Pinto, Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar and Rubina Ali, all of whom turn in stunning performances.

    <title lang="en">Summer Catch</title>
    <desc lang="en">This summer could not be more crucial for Ryan Dunne, a blue-collar kid with aspirations to become a major league baseball player. Every summer, the hottest college ball players descend upon Cape Cod to pursue their baseball dreams during the day and blow off steam in town at night. The first local boy in years to earn a slot in the team, Ryan finally got his shot but the temptations off-field are getting in the way of his commitment to the game. Soon, a beautiful young woman who summers in the town with her family distracts Ryan. As the friction builds between his loyal townie friends and his cocky teammates, Ryan's rivalry with hotshot teammate Eric comes to a head. When a major league scout comes along, however, he tries to push the pangs of romance and player rivalry aside, because his sports talent may be his only ticket out of the small industrial town(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">1408</title>
    <desc lang="en">A writer renowned for debunking infamous paranormal events is confronted by a force that he cannot explain upon checking into room 1408 of the notoriously haunted Dolphin Hotel. Mike Enslin (John Cusack) is an author who specializes in horror, but who only believes in what he can see with his eyes and touch with his hands. Having constructed an entire career on his ability to dispel superstitious "haunted house" rumors, Mike is convinced that the afterlife is a manmade construct designed to offer false comfort to the weak minded. Mike's latest project is a book entitled "Ten Nights in Haunted Hotel Rooms," and it seems that in room 1408 of the Dolphin Hotel, this skeptical scribe may finally find proof of the supernatural. Implored by the hotel manager (Samuel L. Jackson) not to enter room 1408, Mike defiantly procures the key and prepares to dispel yet another spectral sham. Now, as is the case with many of life's most profound epiphanies, the writer who thought he knew it all is caught entirely off guard at the precise moment he least expected it. Subsequently faced with undeniable proof of an afterlife, Mike may have a best-seller on his hands if he can simply survive until sunrise. Mary McCormack and Jasmine Jessica Anthony co-star in director Mikael Håfström's (Derailed) adaptation of an original short story by horror icon Stephen King(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Big Eyes</title>
    <desc lang="en">The true story of painter Margaret Keane's life in obscurity while her husband gleaned the notoriety for being the face of her work is brought to the screen by Tim Burton and his Ed Wood screenwriters, Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. The story opens in the late 1950s, when Margaret Keane (Amy Adams) packs up the car with her daughter and their personal belongings, and leaves her husband to start a new life in San Francisco. There, Margaret quickly reconnects with her old friend DeeAnn (Krysten Ritter), and falls head over heels for Walter (Christoph Waltz), an artist and part-time real-estate broker who soon shows great interest in her unique paintings of small children with strikingly expressive, saucer-like eyes. Before long, the two are married, and Walter is claiming credit for Margaret's increasingly popular paintings. With the money rolling in, Margaret initially agrees to go along with the ruse, but the closer she gets to her new husband the more she begins to realize that he's little more than a smooth-talking scam artist. Later, riddled with guild over the fact that she's been deceiving her own daughter as her paintings become a pop-culture phenomenon, Margaret leaves the increasingly abusive Walter, and moves to Hawaii. Only then does Margaret gain the confidence to reclaim the works that have been credited to her husband, even when doing so entails going before the judge and proving that she and she alone created the enchanting children with the big eyes. Danny Huston, Terence Stamp, and Jason Schwartzman co-star(n)</desc>

Tom (Braff) is an aspiring chef whose wife Sofia (Amanda Peet) has just quit her high-paying job to stay home with their new baby. When it becomes abundantly clear that they can no longer maintain their New York City lifestyle, the family picks up and moves to Sofia's hometown in Ohio, where Tom is hired to work at her father's ad agency. It is there that Tom meets Chip (Bateman), the agency's wheelchair-bound golden boy, who also happened to have a one-night stand with Sofia while the two were cheerleaders in high school. Suddenly, Tom finds himself sabotaged by Chip at every step as the nefarious paraplegic schemes to steal Sofia from him and destroy any chance he might have of success at the agency. Released briefly in 2006 under the title Fast Track, the film was retitled The Ex before receiving a wide release in the Spring of 2007(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">1408</title>
    <desc lang="en">A writer renowned for debunking infamous paranormal events is confronted by a force that he cannot explain upon checking into room 1408 of the notoriously haunted Dolphin Hotel. Mike Enslin (John Cusack) is an author who specializes in horror, but who only believes in what he can see with his eyes and touch with his hands. Having constructed an entire career on his ability to dispel superstitious "haunted house" rumors, Mike is convinced that the afterlife is a manmade construct designed to offer false comfort to the weak minded. Mike's latest project is a book entitled "Ten Nights in Haunted Hotel Rooms," and it seems that in room 1408 of the Dolphin Hotel, this skeptical scribe may finally find proof of the supernatural. Implored by the hotel manager (Samuel L. Jackson) not to enter room 1408, Mike defiantly procures the key and prepares to dispel yet another spectral sham. Now, as is the case with many of life's most profound epiphanies, the writer who thought he knew it all is caught entirely off guard at the precise moment he least expected it. Subsequently faced with undeniable proof of an afterlife, Mike may have a best-seller on his hands if he can simply survive until sunrise.

    <title lang="en">Big Eyes</title>
    <desc lang="en">The true story of painter Margaret Keane's life in obscurity while her husband gleaned the notoriety for being the face of her work is brought to the screen by Tim Burton and his Ed Wood screenwriters, Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. The story opens in the late 1950s, when Margaret Keane (Amy Adams) packs up the car with her daughter and their personal belongings, and leaves her husband to start a new life in San Francisco. There, Margaret quickly reconnects with her old friend DeeAnn (Krysten Ritter), and falls head over heels for Walter (Christoph Waltz), an artist and part-time real-estate broker who soon shows great interest in her unique paintings of small children with strikingly expressive, saucer-like eyes. Before long, the two are married, and Walter is claiming credit for Margaret's increasingly popular paintings. With the money rolling in, Margaret initially agrees to go along with the ruse, but the closer she gets to her new husband the more she begins to realize that he's little more than a smooth-talking scam artist. Later, riddled with guild over the fact that she's been deceiving her own daughter as her paintings become a pop-culture phenomenon, Margaret leaves the increasingly abusive Walter, and moves to Hawaii. Only then does Margaret gain the confidence to reclaim the works that have been credited to her husband, even when doing so entails going before the judge and proving that she and she alone created the enchanting children with the big eyes. Danny Huston, Terence Stamp, and Jason Schwartzman co-star(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Meskada</title>
    <desc lang="en">Class and economics muddy the investigation of a homicide in this thriller from director Josh Sternfeld. When a child is found murdered in the small town of Hilliard, police detective Noah Cordin (Nick Stahl) is assigned to investigate the case. The victim's mother, Allison Connor (Laura Benanti), is a wealthy and well-connected member of the County Board of Commissioners, so Cordin is under pressure to find the killer as soon as possible, but working with rookie officer Leslie Spencer (Rachel Nichols), he isn't finding many substantial clues. One of the few pieces of evidence suggests the culprit may have been from the nearby town of Caswell. Cordin was born and raised in Caswell and knows its history well -- while Hilliard is a prosperous suburban community, Caswell is a working-class town fallen on hard times, and its survival is dependent on a proposed factory coming into town. As Cordin spends more and more time in Caswell, he becomes a target for the resentment the locals feel toward their wealthier neighbors, and a tense situation becomes potentially explosive when word begins to circulate that Connor may use her influence to keep the new employer out of Caswell unless someone comes forward to identity who killed her son. Meskada (named for the county that contains both Hilliard and Caswell) also stars Norman Reedus, Kellan Lutz, Jonathan Tucker, and Grace Gummer(n)</desc>

When one of Axle's products turns out to be dangerous and causes several thousand customers to lose a finger, he loses his fortune and spends eight years in prison for gross negligence. Back on the street, Axle is broke but determined to find a way back to the top, though he's just a bit more humble than he used to be and wants to win back the love of his daughter, Claire (Camilla Belle), whom he neglected as a child, and his ex-wife (Virginia Madsen). Things go badly for Axle on his first day working at a big-box discount store, and he's left with little alternative than to ask Claire to let him stay with her; she and her roommate, Fibbi (Heather Graham), aren't so sure this is a good idea, but they grudgingly agree and end up helping Axle in his bid to redeem himself.

The science of robotics is so advanced that humanoid-looking servants have been developed, ready to obey any command from a human. When the chief designer of US Robotics, the biggest manufacturer of this new brand, is found dead in the company's atrium after a fall from the upper floor, it has all the hallmarks of suicide, and Chicago cop Del Spooner is assigned to the case. But, because of a previous trauma, Spooner is a technophobe and doesn't believe that all robots are harmless. Despite opposition from both his superiors and the company, he investigates further and soon his suspicions centre on one robot, Sonny (voiced by Alan Tudyk). Is "he" one of an army of conscious, violent robots ready to challenge their human masters?(n)</desc>

The science of robotics is so advanced that humanoid-looking servants have been developed, ready to obey any command from a human. When the chief designer of US Robotics, the biggest manufacturer of this new brand, is found dead in the company's atrium after a fall from the upper floor, it has all the hallmarks of suicide, and Chicago cop Del Spooner is assigned to the case. But, because of a previous trauma, Spooner is a technophobe and doesn't believe that all robots are harmless. Despite opposition from both his superiors and the company, he investigates further and soon his suspicions centre on one robot, Sonny (voiced by Alan Tudyk). Is "he" one of an army of conscious, violent robots ready to challenge their human masters?(n)</desc>

Xavier's father arranges for him to meet a ranking member of the Ministry of Finance, who makes him an offer -- he can give him a good job, but only under the condition that he learn to speak Spanish. Determined not to pass up the opportunity, Xavier enrolls in a language program in Barcelona, despite the misgivings of his girlfriend, Martine (Audrey Tautou). Upon his arrival, Xavier moves into a large house shared by a large group of students from all over Europe. Xavier finds that his ideas and attitudes are challenged in a positive way by the diverse personalities of his housemates, and that his loyalty to Martine is tested by his attraction to Anne-Sophie (Judith Godrèche), a sweet but lonesome woman from France who has been away from her husband for too long. After a visit, most of Xavier's roommates decide they don't much care for Martine and Xavier gets advice on seducing Anne-Sophie from an unexpected source -- Isabelle (Cécile de France), a footloose lesbian living in the house. L'Auberge Espagnole received its world premier at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival, and went on to earn prizes at the 2002 Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, the 2003 Lumière Awards, and the 2003 César Awards(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Dreaming of Joseph Lees</title>
    <desc lang="en">This drama takes place in Somerset, England in 1958. Eva is a twenty-year-old woman who fantasizes about travel, painting, classic books, and the attention of Joseph Lees, her second cousin, with whom she fell in love as a girl. Joseph, whom she has not seen for four years, is the only member of the family who has managed to get away from the stale domestic cycle. He has recently been injured in a truck accident and Eva imagines herself curing his wounds. She conceals her obsession from everyone except her sister, the precocious Janie, who is twelve years old. Reality is far away from Eva's dreams. Her artistic endeavors are confined to a local drawing class; she works for a meager salary at a dirty sawmill and the only male around to appreciate her female charm is the local pig farmer, Harry Flyte. Harry's sister Maria is anxious to marry off her brother so that she can be free to do as she pleases. Eva moves in with Harry, but when she meets Joseph at a family gathering, the old flame is rekindled. However, Harry is not so easy to get rid of. Dreaming of Joseph Lees is a family drama and the first feature of Eric Styles(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Young Man's Fancy</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Young Man's Fancy. According to this Richard Matheson-scripted Twilight Zone episode, there is such a thing as too much nostalgia. While visiting his childhood home with his new wife Virginia (Phyllis Thaxter), Alex Walker (Alex Nicol) begins exulting over the artifiacts of his youth -- toys, books, clothes, and the like. What Virginia doesn't know until it's too late is that Alex has fallen under the spell of his late mother (Helen Brown), who intends to reclaim her "little boy" at any cost. The ending is hardly satisfactory, but this cannot be blamed on Matheson, who had an entirely different (and infinitely more suitable) denoument in mind. "Young Man's Fancy" was originally telecast May 11, 1962(n)</desc>

Meanwhile, Remy finds an unexpected ally in the form of his long-lost wife, Beth (Alice Braga), who has also been retrofitted with numerous artificial organs.

    <title lang="en">Kicking &amp; Screaming</title>
    <desc lang="en">Immaturity and poor sportsmanship once again find their firmly established place in children's athletics (at least among the adults) in this sports comedy. Phil Weston (Will Ferrell) is a tightly wound suburban father who had a competitive streak worn into him by his father, Buck (Robert Duvall), who never seemed to feel that his son measured up. When Phil's son joins a Little League soccer team, Phil signs on as coach, only to learn that Buck -- who also has a ten-year-old son these days -- will be coaching a team in the same league. Determined to show his father he can do the job, Phil impresses upon his young charges that winning is the only important thing, and soon gains a few enemies as he humiliates not only the kids on his own team, but their opponents as well. Directed by Jesse Dylan, Kicking &amp; Screaming also features Kate Walsh and legendary football coach Mike Ditka. The screenplay was authored by Steve Rudnick and Leo Benvenuti (The Santa Clause) prior to the latter's death in 2000(n)</desc>

Ultimately, the only "Charmed One" left standing is Piper (Holly Marie Combs), and it is she who must put time back in joint and save her sisters (not to mention the future world)(n)</desc>
