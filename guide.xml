    <title lang="en">The Conspirator</title>
    <desc lang="en">Robert Redford's historical drama tells the story of Mary Surratt, who was put on trial for collusion in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Robin Wright plays Surratt, a widow whose boarding house was a meeting place for the conspirators and whose son John may have been involved in the plot. Surratt's initially reluctant defence lawyer is Frederick Aiken, whose doubts about taking on the case are gradually superseded by a conviction that Surratt is being used as a scapegoat. The cast also includes Evan Rachel Wood, Colm Meaney and Kevin Kline, and the performances and period detail are as impressive as could be expected of the talent involved. If the political stance of the film is a little simplistic, it's nevertheless a polished and thoughtful production(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">In America</title>
    <desc lang="en">After chronicling various chapters of Irish history in such films as In the Name of the Father and The Field, writer/director Jim Sheridan turns his lens upon his own family's experiences immigrating to the United States in the aptly titled In America. The loosely autobiographical script centers on Johnny (Paddy Considine), a young actor sneaking his wife, Sarah (Samantha Morton), and daughters, Christy and Ariel (real-life sisters Sarah and Emma Bolger, respectively), over the Canadian border in the hopes of jump-starting his career in New York City. They soon find that America is not the land of boundless opportunity, however, as they move into a dank, dilapidated apartment building populated by drug dealers, transients, and thugs. Johnny doesn't snag auditions as easily as he may have hoped, and he and Sarah are forced to take meager jobs after spending their savings on food, rent, and utilities. Still in grief over the untimely death of their toddler son back in Ireland, the couple find their relationship further strained by the pressures of life in the city. Little by little, however, things begin to look up for the fiercely protective family unit, especially when they befriend an eccentric artist neighbor named Mateo (Djimon Hounsou). In America saw its world premiere at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival and played to enthusiastic crowds at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival before its theatrical release in the fall of that year(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Sue Barker introduces further coverage from SW19, where the last-eight of the ladies' singles draw is the main attraction of the day, including Johanna Konta v Simona Halep and Venus Williams v Jelena Ostapenko. British number one Konta came from a set down to beat Caroline Garcia in the previous round and will have to be at her best to defeat the second seed. Williams continues her bid to win her sixth Wimbledon singles title and her first since 2008, but this year's French Open champion, who is 17 years her junior, stands in her way. Other matches due to take place today include the quarter-finals in both the men's and ladies doubles competitions.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Sue Barker introduces further coverage from SW19, where the men's quarter-final singles matches are due to take place. Two of the last-eight encounters at last year's tournament took place on Centre Court, the first of which saw seven-time champion Roger Federer face Marin Cilic, who was looking to progress to the semi-finals at the All England Club for the first time in his career. Sadly for the Croat, despite claiming the first two sets 7-6, 6-4, he would go on to lose a five-set thriller, as the Swiss battled back to claim the next three sets by scores of 6-3, 7-6 and 6-3 again. Following that epic battle, British number one Andy Murray took centre stage, and appeared to be sailing through to the last-four after taking a two-set lead against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, only for the Frenchman to battle back and claim the next two sets himself, before Murray powered to victory by claiming the deciding set by a score of 6-1.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Award-winning director Patrick Forbes goes beyond the headlines to film the battle to govern Britain, after last year's Referendum vote on 23rd June 2016. Filmed over one extraordinary year since the public voted to leave the European Union, it is a story of low politics, high ambition and bitter personal animosities, with the biggest decision the country has faced in decades at stake. Can the Prime Minister tame the judges, the opposition, and finally the public to deliver Brexit?.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Day Nine.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Sue Barker introduces continued coverage of the men's quarter-final singles matches, which are expected to be the main focus of attention on day nine. Those in attendance on Number One Court of the corresponding day of last year's tournament witnessed two of the last-eight encounters to take place, beginning with Milos Raonic against Sam Querrey. While Raonic had previously appeared in a quarter-final match at SW19 in 2014, Querry had not previously progressed beyond the fourth round, and was aiming to continue his best-ever run at a Grand Slam event. Sadly for the American it was the Canadian who came out on top, eventually winning 6-4, 7-5, 5-7, 6-4 to set up a meeting with Roger Federer. The other contest between Tomas Berdych and Lucas Pouille proved to be a rather one-sided affair, with 2010 runner-up Berdych claiming a straight-sets victory over the inexperienced Frenchman. Other matches scheduled to take place today include the semi-finals of the ladies' doubles competition.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">A Good Marriage.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Historian Helen Castor explores marriage in the Middle Ages, revealing how family and friends were often heavily involved in bringing two individuals together. She also discovers how the Catholic Church tried to impose controls on matrimony after the ability to hold a wedding almost anywhere had led to a free-for-all, driven by the unpredictable human emotions of love and lust.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Britain and the Sea</title>
    <sub-title lang="en">Pleasure &amp; Escape.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">David Dimbleby sails along the coast of East Anglia, exploring how Britain's view of the sea has changed over the past 200 years. The coast and the beach became a playground for the nation, inspiring artists, transforming coastal architecture and creating a seaside culture that remains uniquely British. Setting out from Gorleston-on-Sea, he travels down the Suffolk and Essex coasts and into the Thames, until he reaches Greenwich. Along the way he discovers works of art that reflect Britain's evolving relationship with the sea, meets a sand sculptor and visits the Queen's House in Greenwich, built in 1616 as a waterside retreat for Queen Anne and now home to Britain's greatest collection of maritime artefacts. Last in the series.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The British Garden: Life and Death on Your Lawn</title>
    <desc lang="en">Chris Packham and a group of experts spend 12 months scrutinising the wildlife in eight gardens on a suburban street in Welwyn Garden City. Throughout the seasons they find male crickets that bribe females with food during sex, spiders that change colour to help catch prey, and ferocious life-and-death battles in the compost heap. They also shows a different side to familiar garden residents, revealing how a robin's red breast is actually war paint, and a single litter of foxes can have up to five different fathers.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Hunting the Nazi Gold Train</title>
    <desc lang="en">In August 2015 two amateur researchers declared they had found a lost Nazi train buried in a railway cutting near Walbrzych in Silesia, southern Poland. This followed decades of local folklore that a train, loaded with gold, had vanished after leaving Wroclaw in early 1945. Dan Snow follows the treasure hunters as they embark on the hunt, while also investigating this extraordinary story that leads all the way to Adolf Hitler himself and his secret plans for this remote corner of the Third Reich during the closing months of the Second World War.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Light-hearted documentary shedding light on the lives of people whose extravagant tastes often leave their parents or significant others substantially out of pocket. These so-called `divas' are more than willing to throw tantrums, manipulate relatives and resort to emotional blackmail to get what they want. Among the pampered persons highlighted are shopping-obsessive Janey, who withholds sex from her fiance as a means of getting access to his bank account, and ambitious teen Romy, who demands her mother supply her with a `big budget' wardrobe to match her big dreams. Also featured is apprentice hairdresser Matthew, who plans to emulate the camp excess of Lady Gaga as a performer, much to the dismay of long-suffering boyfriend Dylan.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Timmy! 2000. The over-prescribing of Ritalin is satirized in this more irreverent than average episode of South Park. Timmy, a retarded boy capable of saying little more than his name, is diagnosed with ADD and is not forced to do homework. Soon the entire childhood population of South Park has been diagnosed the same way. Timmy ends up singing lead with a local metal band, Lords of the Underworld, while the Ritalin has made the children increase their appreciation of Phil Collins. Luckily, Chef saves the day for everyone. "Timmy 2000" first aired April 19, 2000, on Comedy Central, less than a month after Collins had earned a Best Song Oscar, beating out Trey Parker and Marc Shaiman who were nominated for "Blame Canada" from the movie South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut(n)</desc>

In the 1970s, as today, the Kennedy name carried a lot of clout. Its clan members were a hounded and romanticized group. But when trouble strikes too close to home, someone must be held accountable. Martha Moxley was an energetic teenager who resided in the prestigious neighborhood of Belle Haven in Greenwich, CT. After a night of Halloween parties, Moxley turned up beaten to death outside the home of Michael and Thomas Skakel, cousins to Robert Kennedy. For almost 25 years, the murder went unsolved. Rumors circulated that it was one of the two boys, who both professed a romantic interest in the popular girl. When a broken golf club used to kill Moxley was linked to the Skakel family, the case was still uninvestigated.

With their fiery fusion of Latin and hip-hop moves, Lina Cruz (Christina Milian) and her best friends Gloria (Vanessa Born) and Treyvonetta (Gabrielle Dennis) are about to lead the East L.A. high school cheer squad to victory at one of the most prominent competitions in the nation. But just as the crew is about to take the world by storm, Lina's mother remarries and the family makes the move to Florida. Once there, Lina quickly realizes that the Malibu Vista High Sea Lions aren't anywhere near as talented as her old cheer squad. Now, in order to transform the Sea Lions into a championship team, Lina must teach them the moves needed to knock the award-winning Jaguar cheer squad and their trash-talking captain Avery (Rachele Brooke Smith) out of the top spot. When Lina and Avery's brother Evan (Cody Longo) becomes romantically involved, the competition between the two girls really begins to heat up. With the stakes higher than ever before, Lina hatches a scheme to take her team all the way to the top and prove that they have what it takes to become true champions(n)</desc>

When La Fleur learns that he must pay the bank $50,000 in 30 days, Goodman is overjoyed: he can acquire his rival's building, knock it down and have the car park his gym's always needed. But La Fleur decides to set up a money-earning dodgeball tournament (a sport that consists of not being hit by balls hurled by the opposing team). And, of course, La Fleur's team of misfits end up in a face-off against Goodman's tough pros in the final. Rawson Marshall Thurber's debut feature is a mix of verbal and physical humour, and, if the outcome is never in doubt, both Vaughn and Stiller throw themselves into the venture with enjoyable gusto(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Nothing Like the Holidays</title>
    <desc lang="en">Freddy Rodriguez, John Leguizamo, Debra Messing, Alfred Molina, and Elizabeth Peña star in Washington Heights director Alfredo de Villa's earnest family drama about the importance of familial relationships in times of personal crisis. The snow is falling and Christmas has come to Chicago. For the Rodriguez family, there is particular cause to celebrate this year; youngest sibling Jesse (Rodriguez) has recently returned home safe and sound after fighting in the war overseas. But as the members of the Rodriguez family converge on their parent's home, there's a strange sense of tension lingering heavy in the cool winter air. Despite the fact that Jesse is doing his best to get back in the good graces of his old flame, she seems reluctant to forgive him for leaving in the first place. Meanwhile, his older sister, Roxanna, has little to show for time spent chasing her Hollywood dreams, and eldest brother Mauricio (Leguizamo) is married to a high-strung executive who seems more interested in advancing her career than starting a family. But while none of this sits too well with concerned mother Anna (Peña), the bombshell she's about to drop could prove the straw that broke this family's back. When Anna announces to her children that she is planning to divorce their father, Eduardo (Molina), Roxanna, Jesse, and Mauricio instinctively pull together and begin to reevaluate their past while looking at the future in a whole new light. Later, as lingering resentments are let go and weakened bonds are reaffirmed, the Rodriquez family begins to experience the healing power of laughter while discovering that together as a family they are far stronger than they ever could be apart(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">For Love of the Game</title>
    <desc lang="en">Based on the novel by Michael Shaara, For Love of the Game brought Kevin Costner back to the world of baseball after his successes with Bull Durham (1988) and Field of Dreams (1989). Billy Chapel (Kevin Costner) is a star pitcher with the Detroit Tigers, standing on the mound at Yankee Stadium and throwing what is shaping up to be a perfect game with the help of his best friend and catcher, Gus Osinski (John C. Reilly). However, Billy is having a hard time keeping his mind on the game; he's come to a crossroads in both his personal and professional lives, and he isn't sure what to do or where to go. He's learned that the Tigers are about to be sold, and the new owners intend to trade him at the end of the season, and that his girlfriend Jane (Kelly Preston) is planning to leave him. For Love of the Game represents a change of pace for director Sam Raimi, best-known for the Evil Dead trilogy and the acclaimed suspense drama A Simple Plan (1998) (although Raimi, a baseball fan born in Michigan, doubtless enjoyed making a film featuring the Detroit Tigers)(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Brooklyn's Finest</title>
    <desc lang="en">Training Day director Antoine Fuqua takes viewers on a dark ride through the streets of Brooklyn, following three New York Police officers as they wrestle with temptation, loyalty, and duty while attempting to uphold the law and deal with the pressures of the job. Eddie Dugan (Richard Gere) is days away from retirement, but he's been burnt-out for years. Unable to remember why he signed up for the job in the first place, all Eddie can think about is retreating to his fishing cabin in Connecticut, and forgetting the horrors that he's seen during his decades on the job. At the same time, undercover narcotics cop Clarence "Tango" Butler (Don Cheadle) is right in the thick of it. As hard as he tries to quit, however, his superiors always find a way of keeping him on the job. Much like Dugan, he's lost sight of his priorities, and these days Tango's loyalties seem to lie more with notorious inner-city drug dealer Caz (Wesley Snipes) than with the boys in blue. And Tango isn't the only cop who's being drawn to the dark side of the law; narcotics officer Sal Procida's (Ethan Hawke) wife is currently pregnant with twins, and he's barely making enough to keep his family afloat. When Sal learns that his wife is at risk of losing their unborn children, desperation drives him to consider unethical means of ensuring financial stability. In seven days, the lives of all three officers will converge at one crime scene as the NYPD attempts to clean up the BK projects, the epicenter of lawlessness in the highest-crime precinct(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Supercross</title>
    <desc lang="en">Two siblings find themselves competing on and off the racetrack in this action-packed drama. K.C. Carlyle (Steve Howey) and his kid brother, Trip (Mike Vogel), are both racers in the rough and tumble world of supercross, a revved-up variation on motocross racing in which specially modified motorcycle negotiate specially built dirt tracks that send riders through tricky twists and turns, over rough terrain, and off high-flying jumps. Both are talented racers, but K.C. has a wilder and more reckless approach, while Trip follows a more cautious path. A more profound difference between them arises when K.C. is offered a lucrative deal to ride for a factory-sponsored team; he takes the deal, and leaves his brother behind to race on his own dime. However, when an accident takes Trip out of the running on the supercross circuit, he and K.C. set aside their differences as Trip helps coach his older brother so he can succeed in his drive to the championship. Made with the cooperation of a leading supercross race promoter, Supercross: The Movie also stars Sophia Bush and Cameron Richardson as the brothers' love interests, and Robert Carradine as a determined race coach(n)</desc>

Their first task is to bake a tarte Tatin, with judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry looking for intriguing flavour combinations to tickle their tastebuds.

It is 1985 and Richard Nixon continues his tenure in the White House, massively popular with the electorate following his crushing defeat of the Viet Cong. However, it seems that the American public have fallen out of love with their superheroes, one of whom, Dr Manhattan, was largely responsible for the winning the Vietnam War. Now, he and his fellow crime-fighters are regarded as reprehensible vigilantes and have been banned by law. But, when one of their number - the vile, ironically named Comedian - is murdered, the former heroes begin to re-emerge from the shadows to investigate. They discover that a terrifying plan is afoot... Also starring Matthew Goode, Malin Akerman, Patrick Wilson and Jackie Earle Haley(n)</desc>

However, it seems that the American public have fallen out of love with their superheroes, one of whom, Dr Manhattan, was largely responsible for the winning the Vietnam War. Now, he and his fellow crime-fighters are regarded as reprehensible vigilantes and have been banned by law. But, when one of their number - the vile, ironically named Comedian - is murdered, the former heroes begin to re-emerge from the shadows to investigate. They discover that a terrifying plan is afoot... Also starring Matthew Goode, Malin Akerman, Patrick Wilson and Jackie Earle Haley(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The World According to Garp</title>
    <desc lang="en">The 1982 film version of the John Irving novel The World According to Garp attempts to captures the quirky spirit while condensing the Irving original. Robin Williams plays the title character, the son of unmarried, unorthodox feminist Jenny Fields (Glenn Close, in her film debut). Every effort made by Jenny to broaden Garp's outlook on life -- she even arranges for him to spend the night with a hooker (Swoosie Kurtz) -- crams more fears and phobias into his psyche. Aspiring to become a novelist, Garp succeeds in this goal at the same time that his mother publishes her first feminist manifesto. Though successful and happily married to college sweetheart Helen Holm (Mary Beth Hurt), Garp remains envious of his fearless mother, who has taken in the radical "Ellen Jamesians," a group named after a young woman who had her tongue cut out by a rapist. Mutilation, in fact, becomes something of a leitmotif in Garp's life, climaxing (in every sense of the word) in an auto accident brought about by Helen's tryst with Michael Milton (Mark Soper). There is, of course, much more to the story than this: standing out amongst the dozens of offbeat supporting characters is John Lithgow as Roberta Muldoon, a transexual ex-football jock. John Irving appears as a referee during a college wrestling match, while director George Roy Hill plays the pilot whose low-flying plane crashes into Garp's new home. The World According to Garp didn't attract as large an audience as other, more conventional Robin Williams vehicles, though Close and Lithgow would both be nominated for Best Supporting Actor statues(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Soul Food</title>
    <desc lang="en">For over 40 years, members of the Joseph family have gathered at Big Mama Joe's house to feast on soul food and familial love. Every Sunday, there was a mouth-watering array of fried chicken, catfish, cornbread, collards, potato salad, mac and cheese, biscuits, gravy, sweet potatoes and pie all lovingly prepared by Mama Joe (Irma P. Hall) and her three daughters, Teri, Maxine and Bird. These sisters could not be more different. Teri (Vanessa L. Williams) is an ambitious lawyer married to attorney/aspiring recording artist Miles (Michael Beach). As the wealthy ones in the otherwise middle-class clan, they are constantly helping out other family members, something that Teri resents, but always does. Bird (Nia Long) is the baby sister who at the beginning of the film marries Lem Davis (Mekhi Phifer), an ex-con struggling to stay straight. Bird has just opened a beauty shop thanks to a loan from Teri. Maxine (Viveca A. Fox) is a pregnant housewife happily married to hard-working Kenny (Jeffrey D. Sams). Their two children are cute little Kelly and 10-year-old Ahmad (Brandon Hammond), the story's narrator. He and Mama Joe share a special bond and he knows that she is the glue that keeps the family together. When Mama Joe falls ill, the glue weakens, old wounds between the sisters open, and familial chaos ensues, leaving only Ahmad to somehow obey his grandmother's wishes and reunite the family. Based on incidents from the life of screenwriter/director George Tillman, Soul Food is an upbeat comedy-drama, that while a little long, uneven in the middle and somewhat contrived in its attempts to manipulate the heartstrings, presents an African American family in a positive light. Its message could apply to any family: unity is strength(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Student Jennifer Check is the stereotypical cheerleader: beautiful, bitchy and adored by all (other than those who are on the receiving end of her cruel wit) at her school in Devil's Kettle. However, local indie band Low Shoulder are more interested in her body than everyone else. In a bid to further their careers, they've made a pact with the Devil: one that requires the soul of a virgin. They kidnap and kill Jennifer, but unfortunately she was no virgin - and she rises again as a literal man-eater to take terrible retribution by ravenously rampaging her way through the school. Only one person stands a chance of halting the carnage: Jennifer's best friend Anita 'Needy' Lesnicky, who's nerdy, for sure, but also may have the strength of character to succeed where others have been ingested... And don't miss the excellent Australian horror The Loved Ones, up next(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Dramatised documentary analysing the crimes of serial killer Harold Shipman, the doctor believed to be responsible for the deaths of an estimated 250 people. The first instalment of this two-part programme looks at what drove Shipman to kill over a period of almost 30 years, examining his early school days as a model pupil up to his time as a junior doctor in Pontefract Hospital. Featuring interviews with Margaret Sivorn, who worked with him in Pontefract, and consultant forensic psychiatrist Richard Badcock, who was the only psychiatrist to assess Shipman.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The concluding edition of this two-part docu-drama looks at how Shipman covered his tracks and examines the unravelling of decades of lies that subsequently led to his conviction. In March 1998, staff at the local crematorium became suspicious of the deaths signed off by Shipman and alerted the coroner, but a police investigation was stopped after just three weeks. It was the subsequent death of Kathleen Grundy that triggered his downfall, and her daughter and son-in-law Angela and Phil Woodruff describe their reactions when they discovered that Shipman was bizarrely the sole benefactor of Kathleen's estate.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Final Cut</title>
    <desc lang="en">Omar Naim's science-fiction thriller is set in a world where Zoe memory implants capture every memory. Retrieved after the subject's death, the implant is sent to a 'Cutter' for editing into a two-hour video for the bereaved. Alan Harkman is one of the best in the business and is hired by Jennifer Bannister to edit the memory of her husband, who was CEO of the company that developed Zoe. He also abused children, including their daughter, areas Harkman erases until he sees a face from his own past that sends him on his own quest. There is also a subplot with a rebel Cutter, Fletcher, who belongs to a group that believes the implants inhibit natural human expression, and wants Bannister's implant for their own reasons. This intelligent film was released in the same year as the similarly themed Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and The Manchurian Candidate but received a surprisingly limited release in Britain; this is a rare chance to enjoy it(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">(2004) Michel Gondry's film, co-scripted with Charlie Kaufman (Adaptation, Being John Malkovich), is a fascinating melange of romance, fantasy and illusion. Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) and Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) were once madly in love, but their affair has gone stale. And when they meet again by chance, she doesn't just blank him, she genuinely doesn't know him. Then Joel finds out the truth: using a new and highly experimental technology, she is having her memories of him erased from her brain. In revenge, he's determined to undergo the same process but, as dodgy scientist Dr Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) begins the procedure, Joel changes his mind. Can he hang on to enough memories to win Clementine back? M,W,R,S,(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Final Cut</title>
    <desc lang="en">Omar Naim's science-fiction thriller is set in a world where Zoe memory implants capture every memory. Retrieved after the subject's death, the implant is sent to a 'Cutter' for editing into a two-hour video for the bereaved. Alan Harkman is one of the best in the business and is hired by Jennifer Bannister to edit the memory of her husband, who was CEO of the company that developed Zoe. He also abused children, including their daughter, areas Harkman erases until he sees a face from his own past that sends him on his own quest. There is also a subplot with a rebel Cutter, Fletcher, who belongs to a group that believes the implants inhibit natural human expression, and wants Bannister's implant for their own reasons. This intelligent film was released in the same year as the similarly themed Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and The Manchurian Candidate but received a surprisingly limited release in Britain; this is a rare chance to enjoy it(n)</desc>

In this macabre story, Shaun (Simon Pegg) is down in the dumps, going through an unstoppable crisis in his life. About to turn 30, he passes the time in The Winchester bar, dislikes his job, argues with his mother every day, and the relationship with his girlfriend, Liz (Kate Ashfield), worsens by the hour. When she finally leaves him, Shaun decides, once and for all, to do something about his life. His first step is not visiting a psychologist, but confronting an invasion of living dead with just two weapons: a cricket bat and a shovel! Zombies Party is -at the same time- a parody and a tribute to zombie films(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Gangs of New York</title>
    <desc lang="en">The violent rise of gangland power in New York City at a time of massive political corruption and the city's evolution into a cultural melting pot set the stage for this lavish historical epic, which director Martin Scorsese finally brought to the screen almost 30 years after he first began to plan the project. In 1846, as waves of Irish immigrants poured into the New York neighborhood of Five Points, a number of citizens of British and Dutch heritage who were born in the United States began making an open display of their resentment toward the new arrivals. William Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis), better known as "Bill the Butcher" for his deadly skill with a knife, bands his fellow "Native Americans" into a gang to take on the Irish immigrants; the immigrants in turn form a gang of their own, "The Dead Rabbits," organized by Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson). After an especially bloody clash between the Natives and the Rabbits leaves Vallon dead, his son goes missing; the boy ends up in a brutal reform school before returning to the Five Points in 1862 as Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio). Now a strapping adult who has learned how to fight, Amsterdam has come to seek vengeance against Bill the Butcher, whose underworld control of the Five Points through violence and intimidation dovetails with the open corruption of New York politician "Boss" Tweed (Jim Broadbent). Amsterdam gradually penetrates Bill the Butcher's inner circle, and he soon becomes his trusted assistant. Amsterdam also finds himself falling for Jenny Everdeane (Cameron Diaz), a beautiful but street-smart thief who was once involved with Bill. Amsterdam is learning a great deal from Bill, but before he can turn the tables on the man who killed his father, Amsterdam's true identity is exposed, even though he has concealed it from nearly everyone, including Jenny. Gangs Of New York was the first film in two years from actor Leonardo DiCaprio; ironically, it was at one time scheduled to open on the same day as Catch Me if You Can, the Steven Spielberg project that DiCaprio began filming immediately after Gangs wrapped(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Showdown with Rance McGrew. Larry Blyden stars in this hilarious Twilight Zone entry as egocentric TV western star Rance McGrew, who, while filming a fight scene, is knocked cold by a prop bottle. Upon awakening, Rance finds himself in the real west, circa 1880 -- and at the mercy of none other than Jesse James (Arch Johnson). It seems that old Jesse isn't too thrilled as to how he and his fellow outlaws have been depicted on Rance's series, and he intends to teach the vainglorious actor a lesson. Best line: "And you won an Emmy? Shoot, you can't act any better than you can draw!" This episode reunited two alumni of the classic 1951 sci-fi thriller The Thing: actor Robert Cornthwaite, and director Christian Nyby. Scripted by Rod Serling from an idea by Frederic Louis Fox (which in its original form wasn't a comedy at all), "Showdown with Rance McGrew" first aired February 2, 1962(n)</desc>

Was the fifth-season finale of Friends merely a misleading "teaser," or did Ross (David Schwimmer) and Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) really get married during the gang's tumultuous trip to Las Vegas? The answer, provided in the series' season-six opener, is both "no" and "yes": no, it wasn't a tease, and yes, Ross and Rachel are husband and wife (though having been drunk during the ceremony, it takes them a while to become aware of the fact!). Elsewhere on the romantic scene, Monica (Courteney Cox) and Chandler (Matthew Perry), upon returning to New York, decide to move in together, even though (unlike Ross and Rachel) their planned Vegas wedding never came off. And poor Joey (Matt LeBlanc) is also back in town, his latest "big break" in show business having blown up in his face, obliging him to head back to the Big Apple with feckless Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) at the wheel. The hilarious "hyphenated" closing credits of this episode reflect the recent marriage of Courteney Cox and actor David Arquette(n)</desc>
