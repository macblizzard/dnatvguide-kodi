    <desc lang="en">Matt Lucas returns to narrate another light-hearted retrospective poking fun at Britain's viewing habits in the 1970s. This time, he focuses on the world of comedy, unfettered as it was to the conventions of political correctness. A selection of clips from hit TV shows illustrate how, if viewers were not straight, white, middle-class men, they were at risk of being offended, and highlights examples from On the Buses, The Two Ronnies, Dave Allen at Large and The Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club. Includes commentary and contributions by Melvyn Hayes, Eric Chappell, Bill Oddie, Krishnan Guru-Murthy, Grace Dent, Nish Kumar, Ellie Taylor, Joel Dommett and Phil Wang.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Pearl Harbour: The New Evidence.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Documentary shedding light on whether there is any truth to conspiracy theorists' suggestions that London and Washington had been aware the Japanese were planning to assault the American naval base at Pearl Harbour in 1941, but refused to act on the intelligence as part of a plot to bring the full might of America's military into the Second World War. In the wake of the attack, an investigation into how US forces failed to anticipate the assault concluded that Admiral Husband Kimmel, Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet, had been guilty of dereliction of duty, a charge that left his career in tatters. Making use of new research into a top-secret US military project, as well as thousands of freshly unearthed documents, letters and photographs, this film aims to answer - once and for all - whether the brutal attack that claimed nearly 2,500 lives could have been prevented.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Snow Angels</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director/screenwriter David Gordon Green adapts Stewart O'Nan's popular novel to the screen in this feature, which tells the parallel tales of a teenager named Arthur (Michael Angarano) and his onetime babysitter Annie (Kate Beckinsale) -- whose turbulent relationship with her estranged husband, Glenn (Sam Rockwell), leads the small-town waitress down a troubled path. Arthur is a high-school student from a dysfunctional family, and does everything in his power to avoid hanging around the house while mom and dad quarrel. When he's not practicing his trombone and performing with the high-school marching band, Arthur can usually be found bussing tables at the local Chinese restaurant and flirting with older waitress Annie. Annie used to be Arthur's babysitter, and is currently struggling to separate from her former high-school sweetheart, Glenn. But being a single mother isn't easy, especially since the troubled Glenn wants nothing more than to clean up his act and reunite his family. Back at school, Arthur and pretty classmate Lila (Olivia Thirlby) have been bonding over their mutual love for all things geeky. Though the casual friendship shows promise of evolving into something more when Lila expresses her true feelings for Arthur, he can't help but becoming distracted by his chaotic family life: his father is moving out of the family home, and his mother is doing everything in her power to maintain some semblance of normalcy. Realizing that happiness is fleeting as his family becomes shattered and Annie experiences a series of distressing encounters with Glenn, Arthur gradually begins to fall for Lisa despite his growing cynicism concerning long-term relationships. Later, on a cold winter morning, Glenn and Annie's past catches up with them in a blinding flash, and the lives of everyone they know are suddenly and irrevocably changed(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Boobs in Arms. World War II was just heating up, but the U.S. hadn't yet entered the fighting when the Three Stooges made this comic short. It opens with the boys selling greeting cards on the street, none too successfully. One surly guy in particular is a victim of the Stooges' harassment. To get away from his wrath, the boys dash into an apartment building, where they find a weepy young woman who thinks her husband doesn't love her anymore. To help her out, the Stooges offer to try to make her husband jealous. The woman's spouse turns out to be the very same man they harassed a few minutes earlier. To get away from him -- again -- the guys get in what they think is a bread line, but it's really a recruitment line for the Army. In a flash the Stooges are in uniform -- only to discover that their sergeant is the very same angry husband. They manage to make it through basic training and are sleeping through bomb blasts when they're woken up and sent on a mission. The sergeant has been captured and they're supposed to bomb enemy headquarters with laughing gas. Naturally, the gas shell explodes on them and they're captured. At the enemy headquarters, they manage to knock everyone unconscious while laughing uncontrollably. The place is being shelled by the American troops, and the Stooges, still laughing, ride one of the shells as it soars out of the building(n)</desc>

Charlie phones his lawyer Marty (Cliff De Young), who calls a henchman, Lono (Denis Leary), who investigates the kidnappings and gives Charlie enough information to start playing each of his inexperienced abductors against the others(n)</desc>

Whereas episode five culminated with the Challenger disaster of January 1986, and discussed the impact it had on successive space travel, the final installment, "Home in Space," moves into the 1990s and beyond, with onscreen discussions of the Hubble telescope and its 1993 repair, the construction of the International Space Station (which commenced in 1998), the Columbia shuttle disaster of 2003, and speculations on what lies ahead in the 21st century(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Explorers. The Discovery Channel's cutting-edge documentary miniseries When We Left Earth systematically (and chronologically) weaves the tale of the American Space Race, from the immediate post-WWII years into the early 20th century. The fourth episode of this series, "The Explorers," continues where the prior Apollo-themed installment left off, by visiting a crisis that nearly befell the space program in April 1970. In that now-famous series of events (later immortalized by Ron Howard's 1995 film), a series of astronauts including Fred Haise, Jim Lovell and Jack Swiegert found themselves trapped in a damaged Apollo spacecraft, faced with the slim prospect of returning the vehicle to Earth. The episode touches on their heroic success, then moves ahead into a discussion of additional moon missions during the early 1970s, and the launch and repair of Skylab, which required a never-before-done repair outside of the spacecraft in mid-orbit(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Rauschenberg - American Art Pioneer.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Documentary profiling the work of Robert Rauschenberg, the influential American artist who was the first to win the Golden Lion at the Venice Biennale in 1963, and is said to have blazed a trail for creatives in the US throughout the 20th century. Rauschenberg's work has rarely been seen in the UK, but the Tate Modern is about to change that via a major new retrospective due to open this month. Ahead of the exhibition, Alastair Sooke travels to the east coast of the USA to talk to some of the people closest to Rauschenberg. His interviews provide a portrait of a man with boundless curiosity and a restlessness for experimentation, whose 60-year-long career saw him bridge the gap between the abstract expressionists of the 1950s, and the pop-art enthusiasts of the 1960s.(n)</desc>

Bender immediately joins the league and wins a lot of matches because he's popular. When he starts to lose his public appeal, he asks Leela to coach him for the big match against the giant robot Destructor. She agrees because she has a grudge against Destructor's coach, Phnog, who is also her old martial arts instructor. Leela figures out the secret behind Destructor's power and she saves the day, but Bender still loses and gets kicked out of the league(n)</desc>

Hitler decided to stake his last reserves on a major counter-offensive in the Ardennes region of Belgium, leading to what became known as the Battle of the Bulge. Meanwhile, Soviet troops discovered the first death camps and evidence emerged of the Nazi programme to exterminate the Jewish people.(n)</desc>

Vaughn appears in his traditional A-Team role as the mysterious, manipulative General Stockwell, while McCallum is seen as Stockwell's former partner Ivan Trigorin, now a rogue agent who had sold out to the Other Side. Ivan kidnaps Stillwell and spirits him away to his headquarters at the Coastal Psychiatric Hospital, where he plans to exact a terrible revenge for Stillwell's supposed treachery. Normally, the A-Team would leave Stockwell to his fate, but if they ever hope to get a pardon, they'd better rescue him immediately--even if it requires Murdock (Dwight Schultz) to return to his former "nuttiness." The Say U.N.C.L.E. Affair abounds with clever references to its source material, right down to Stillwell beginning a radio message with "Open Channel D"!(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Greek general Themistokles (Sullivan Stapleton) assembles his troops to fend off an invading Persian army led by the immortal Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) and the vindictive Persian navy commander Artemisia (Eva Green) in this sequel to 300 based on the graphic novel Xerses by Frank Miller. In the wake of the Persians' victory over King Leonidas and his 300 Spartans, the God King Xerxes (Santoro) appears poised to conquer Greece. As the ruthless Artemisia (Eva Green) assembles a massive fleet of ships and sets sail for conquest, Greek general Themistokles (Sullivan Stapleton) strives to rally his countrymen to fight for freedom, and he manages to gain the upper hand over the invaders by confronting them at sea. Meanwhile, Leonidas' former advisor and wife Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) is reluctant to sacrifice any more Spartans in a fight that appears to be unwinnable. When the Greeks enjoy an early victory over Artemisia and her soldiers, however, it appears that Themistokles' unconventional tactics are more effective than the Persian Empire's formidable brawn. But later, after Artemisia's attempt to seduce Themistokles to her side proves unsuccessful, the spurned naval commander deals a devastating blow to her Greek opponents. In the aftermath of that skirmish, Themistokles is presumed dead and Athens falls. The Persian Empire seems on the verge of victory, though when Xerxes and Artemisia learn that Themistokles lives, they realize the fight won't be over until he takes his final breath(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Love Potion No. 9</title>
    <desc lang="en">When it comes to love, Paul Matthews and Diane Farrow, two highly educated and talented scientists don't know a thing. Looking at their geeky demeanor's it's easy to see why. Despite the fact that both are neighbors, share the same interests and both are psychobiologists who study primates, neither is really aware of the other romantically until Paul, who is terribly shy around women, goes to gypsy Madame Ruth in desperation and asks for help. She reads his palm and tells him that he needs a woman; she then hands him Love Potion No. 8 which will attract women like flies to honey. This romantic comedy chronicles what happens to him (and Diane) when, after experimenting on animals, they decide to try it on themselves. Though the changes only last four hours per dose, they are truly remarkable and the two agree to separate for three weeks and then come back together to compare results. The time passes quickly and wonderfully for them and when they finally reunite both have changed for the better. Just for fun, they decide to go out with each other. They do not drink the potion, but still have a wonderful and passionate night. This leads Paul to propose to Diane. Unfortunately, she thinks she loves another, a man who is really more interested in exploiting the potion for money than he is in her. He ends up buying up all of Madame Ruth's latest batch. Paul goes back to her and explains his problem and that is when Ruth hands him the potent Love Potion No. 9, which can manifest true love. Quickly, he takes it and sets off to find Diane before she makes a terrible mistake(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">When a shifty magician turns state's evidence against a Las Vegas underworld heavy, the high price placed on his head sparks a fevered race to rub the snitch out and collect a tidy paycheck in Narc director Joe Carnahan's dark action comedy. Buddy "Aces" Israel (Jeremy Piven) is a small-time scammer who has somehow managed to get the goods on big-time mobster Primo Sparazza. Upon discovering that Buddy is about to deliver the evidence needed to get him thrown in jail for life, Primo takes out a sizable contract on Buddy that entices every two-bit thug, grizzled bounty hunter, deadly vixen, skilled assassin, and ladder-climbing Mafioso within a hundred-mile radius into taking a shot at the prize. Now holed up in his luxurious Lake Tahoe hideout with only two FBI agents (Ryan Reynolds and Ray Liotta) standing between him from a virtual army of money-hungry rogues, Buddy is about to find out just how far this motley crew of killers is willing to go in order to take him out and hit the jackpot. Ben Affleck, Jason Bateman, Andy Garcia, Alicia Keys, and Martin Henderson co-star in a bullet-strewn, ensemble crime comedy that never stops to reload(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Knockaround Guys</title>
    <desc lang="en">A big score goes wrong in a big way for a bunch of aspiring gangsters in this crime comedy. Matty Demaret (Barry Pepper) is the son of a mid-level Brooklyn mob boss, Benny "Chains" Demaret (Dennis Hopper). When Matty was 12 years old, Benny and Uncle Teddy (John Malkovich) decided to see if Matty had what it took to be in the mob; they gave the boy a gun and ordered him to shoot a longtime enemy of the family. Matty lacked the nerve to do it, and ever since, Benny has been convinced his son is a coward. As an adult, Matty is stuck between a rock and a hard place; he'd like to work as a sports agent, but his family's criminal ties make that all but impossible, and his dad won't give him a chance in the family's operations. Uncle Teddy decides to give Matty a chance to make good by asking him to pick up a payment of $500,000 in Spokane, WA. Matty puts together a crew of three friends, all sons of mob guys, to help him out: muscle bound Taylor (Vin Diesel), ladies' man Chris (Andrew Davoli), and cocaine-addled would-be pilot Johnny (Seth Green). Getting the money goes just fine, but during a refueling stop in Montana, Johnny has to hide the money to keep it from being discovered. It's then promptly stolen by a pair of burnouts. When Matty and his crew discover the money is missing, they head back to Montana, but before long, they find out that the sheriff (Tom Noonan) is onto them, and that he has his own plans for the cash; they also learn that Uncle Teddy has some plans he didn't tell them about. Knockaround Guys marked the directorial debut for the screenwriting team of Brian Koppelman and David Levien(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The architect heads off to Italy, where it seems the residents have also been bitten by the `small buildings are beautiful' bug. The most spectacular place he visits is so high up in the mountains that it's only accessible by helicopter, but this difficulty is more than made up for by the views seen from it. Back in Britain, George meets a man turning a wrecked private jet into a crash pad and a Gypsy tattoo artist with big plans for an old railway carriage. George also challenges his pal, craftsman Will Hardie, to create a woodland retreat for less than the price of a family holiday.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Stander</title>
    <desc lang="en">A lawman fed up with the corruption in Apartheid-era South Africa takes to robbing banks in this gritty crime drama from writer/director Bronwen Hughes. The title Stander refers to Andre Stander (Thomas Jane), an ambitious second-generation policeman whose strategies and experience make him the perfect candidate for commander. But when the privileged Stander is chosen to direct the police force against a brutal, majority-led uprising in Soweto, he becomes so disgusted with his actions that he decides to undermine his own authority as an officer. His means for doing so is to moonlight as a bank robber, partly out of disgust for the force and partly as an adrenalin-fueled act of deception. After pulling more than two dozen heists, Stander is caught -- but it isn't long before he breaks out of jail, and fortified by two hardened-criminal pals, Lee (Dexter Fletcher) and Allan (David Patrick O'Hara), he resumes his anti-authoritarian crime sprees. Stander premiered at the 2003 Toronto Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Hesher</title>
    <desc lang="en">A bullied little boy grieving the death of his mother strikes up an unlikely friendship with a Metallica-loving anarchist in this tender yet unsentimental childhood drama. In the wake of his mother's recent death, 13-year-old TJ (Devin Brochu) finds the bumpy road to emotional recovery all the more difficult due to the dual facts that he's bullied at school and that his father (Rainn Wilson) has become a vacant pill-head. Just when it seems like things couldn't possibly get any worse, TJ strikes up an unusual friendship with Hesher (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a greasy-haired anarchist with a beat-up van, homemade tattoos, and a soft spot for explosions. The next thing TJ knows, Hesher is sitting in his living room and watching porn on the family television. Later, though, just as TJ summons the courage to pursue a friendship with Nicole (Natalie Portman), a kindly grocery-store clerk who came to his aid in a time of need, an explosive discovery threatens to propel the embattled teen down a dangerous path of self-destruction(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Stander</title>
    <desc lang="en">A lawman fed up with the corruption in Apartheid-era South Africa takes to robbing banks in this gritty crime drama from writer/director Bronwen Hughes. The title Stander refers to Andre Stander (Thomas Jane), an ambitious second-generation policeman whose strategies and experience make him the perfect candidate for commander. But when the privileged Stander is chosen to direct the police force against a brutal, majority-led uprising in Soweto, he becomes so disgusted with his actions that he decides to undermine his own authority as an officer. His means for doing so is to moonlight as a bank robber, partly out of disgust for the force and partly as an adrenalin-fueled act of deception. After pulling more than two dozen heists, Stander is caught -- but it isn't long before he breaks out of jail, and fortified by two hardened-criminal pals, Lee (Dexter Fletcher) and Allan (David Patrick O'Hara), he resumes his anti-authoritarian crime sprees. Stander premiered at the 2003 Toronto Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Writer/director Sophie Barthes crafts this metaphysical tragicomedy, which straddles the line between reality and fantasy, set in a world where souls are extracted from humans and traded as commodites. Paul Giamatti is an anxious New Yorker who finds the answer to his deep-rooted malaise after stumbling upon an article about a high-tech company that claims to have found a solution to human suffering. By deep-freezing souls, claims the company, they can give their customers a life free from fear, doubt, and worry. Eager to free himself from the emotional burden of angst, Giamatti eagerly enlists their services. Trouble arises, however, when Giamatti's soul is swiped by a soul-trafficking "mule" who in turn gives it to a no-talent Russian soap opera actress. Now, in order to get back the soul that is rightfully his, Giamatti must make the arduous trip to St. Petersburg, along the way discovering that the true key to happiness isn't the absence of pain, but the ability to experience the entire spectrum of emotion and cherish the things that really matter(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Shadow Zone: The Undead Express</title>
    <desc lang="en">A horror semi-parody targeted at the young adult market that ravenously gobbles up horror books like R.L. Stine's Goosebumps series, this made-for-TV vampire tale stars Chauncey Leopardi as Zach, a teenage rebel with a flair for telling ghost stories, who stumbles on an underground cabal of vampires when he takes a fateful ride on a New York subway. The vampire's leader, Valentine (Ron Silver), proposes a deal to young Zach, offering him safe passage to the world above, thus enabling the trapped vampire -- who can only mingle with humanity through the willing assistance of an innocent youth -- to reach the surface as well. Our young hero balks at this idea and escapes to the surface with a wild story for his skeptical pals, who shun him until one of their number is kidnapped by the undead subway dwellers in exchange for Zach's cooperation. Though atmospherically photographed, this low-budget production is a bit too corny to provide either laughs or chills, and it suffers further from lethargic pacing(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Writer/director Sophie Barthes crafts this metaphysical tragicomedy, which straddles the line between reality and fantasy, set in a world where souls are extracted from humans and traded as commodites. Paul Giamatti is an anxious New Yorker who finds the answer to his deep-rooted malaise after stumbling upon an article about a high-tech company that claims to have found a solution to human suffering. By deep-freezing souls, claims the company, they can give their customers a life free from fear, doubt, and worry. Eager to free himself from the emotional burden of angst, Giamatti eagerly enlists their services. Trouble arises, however, when Giamatti's soul is swiped by a soul-trafficking "mule" who in turn gives it to a no-talent Russian soap opera actress. Now, in order to get back the soul that is rightfully his, Giamatti must make the arduous trip to St. Petersburg, along the way discovering that the true key to happiness isn't the absence of pain, but the ability to experience the entire spectrum of emotion and cherish the things that really matter(n)</desc>

Now Sam and his family (wife Jessica Lange and daughter Juliette Lewis, in an outstanding debut) are about to be terrorized by Max, who is determined that they should "learn something about loss". But the Bowden family are not themselves completely innocent: both women find themselves strangely attracted to the murderer, and Sam himself may have withheld some vital evidence at Cady's trial which could have changed the jury's verdict(n)</desc>

Talbert produces, writes, and directs this urban crime comedy concerning a pair of criminals who take a group of church parishioners hostage while attempting to rob the holy house, only to find their captives slowly convincing them to repent and give up their lawless lifestyles. Durell (Ice Cube) and LeeJohn (Tracy Morgan) are two best friends with a special knack for petty crime. Upset at discovering that his ex-girlfriend is planning to move out of state with the couple's young son, Durell knows that the only way to keep his fractured family in close proximity to one another is to raise the 17,000 dollars needed to pay off her growing debt. In order to get the money before his ex decides to make the big move, the desperate Durell enlists the aid of his scheming best buddy to rob their neighborhood church. But someone has beaten Durell and LeeJohn to the punch, and if they ever hope to get their hands on that quick cash, this bumbling pair will first have to spend an entire night in the presence of not just the almighty lord, but some of his most fervent followers as well.

    <title lang="en">Bowling for Columbine</title>
    <desc lang="en">Filmmaker, author, and political activist Michael Moore trains his satirical eye on America's obsession with guns and violence in his third feature-length documentary, which gets its title from a pair of loosely related incidents. On April 20, 1999, shortly before they began their infamous killing spree at Columbine High School in Littleton, CO, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold attended their favorite class, a no-credit bowling course held at a bowling alley near the school, the same bowling alley which would become the scene of a robbery and triple homicide two years later. While pondering these events, Moore humorously considers the link between random violence and the game of ten pins; along the way, Moore calls on the Michigan Militia (and gets to know some of the models for their "Militia Babes" calendar); spends some time with James Nichols, brother of Oklahoma City bombing accomplice Terry Nichols; visits K-Mart's corporate offices with two teenagers injured in the Columbine massacre as they ask the retail chain to stop selling bullets for handguns; investigates the media's role in the American climate of fear and anger; compares crime statistics in the United States with those of Canada (which, despite higher unemployment and a larger number of guns per capita, manages to rack up a small fraction of the homicides committed in the United States), and questions actor and National Rifle Association president Charlton Heston regarding his appearance at a pro-gun rally held in Littleton a few days after the Columbine massacre, and a similar rally in Flint, MI, after a six-year-old boy killed a classmate with a gun he took from his uncle's house. Bowling for Columbine received its first public screening at the 2002 Ann Arbor Film Festival; the film's official premiere took place a few months later at the Cannes Film Festival(n)</desc>

These loving creatures inhabit a realm in the clouds called Care-A-Lot, and their purpose in life is to get the humans down below to share their good feelings with each other. They watch over human children with large telescopes and help those children who need help. The Care Bears have their work cut out for them, because Nicolas, a lonely magician's assistant, is about to fall under the evil influence of a bad spirit who lives in an ancient magic book -- it seems Nicolas will do just about anything for friends. Aside from Nicolas, Kim (Cree Summer) and Jason (Sunny Besen Thracher) are in trouble because they are starting not to trust people after suffering many disappointments.

    <title lang="en">Tuck Everlasting</title>
    <desc lang="en">Natalie Babbitt's award winning book for children comes to the screen in a lavish adaptation from Walt Disney Pictures. Winnie Foster (Alexis Bledel) is a girl in her early teens growing up in the small rural town of Winesap in 1914. Winnie's parents (Victor Garber and Amy Irving) are loving but overprotective, and Winnie longs for a life of greater freedom and adventure. One day, while exploring the nearby woods, Winnie gets lost, but she has the good fortune to happen upon the Tuck Family, who live nearby - mother Mae (Sissy Spacek), father Angus (William Hurt), and sons Jesse (Jonathan Jackson) and Miles (Scott Bairstow). The Tucks are warm and caring people, and Winnie feels right at home with them; she also finds herself developing a serious crush on Jesse, and isn't so sure she wants to return; meanwhile, her parents become increasingly distraught as they search for their missing daughter. But in time Winnie discovers there's a secret behind the seemingly idyllic lives of the Tuck Family; they have discovered a magical spring on their property, and anyone who drinks from it will never grow old and never die. While to Winnie this sounds like a wonderful prospect, the Tucks have come to understand this is as much of a curse as a blessing, especially when she realizes Jesse is considerably older than she is. The Tucks also have to contend with the presence of the sinister Man In The Yellow Suit (Ben Kingsley), who wishes to buy their property and make a fortune from their "fountain of youth." Tuck Everlasting was directed by Jay Russell, who previously directed the acclaimed family film My Dog Skip(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Gabrielle Union, Morris Chestnut, Queen Latifah, and Terrence Howard star in a film concerning a young girl who implores a department-store Santa to find a new husband for her divorced mother for Christmas. Single mother of three Nancy (Union) has been putting the needs of her three children ahead of her own for as far back as she can remember, and lately her youngest daughter, Emily (Khail Bryant), has become acutely aware of her mother's palpable sadness. As Christmas draws near, Nancy takes her kids to the mall for a cheerful visit with jolly old Saint Nick. When it comes time for Emily's turn to sit on Santa's lap and make her Christmas wish, she selflessly remembers her mother's recent comment that a compliment from a man would be the best gift of all. Determined to make her mother happy again even if it means sacrificing her own wish, Emily relays the message to Santa (Chestnut), not realizing that the man beneath the beard is actually an office-supply salesman and ambitious singer/songwriter named Benjamin. Recognizing the daughter's love for her mother and sensing something truly special in Nancy, Benjamin cheerfully obliges the young girl, setting into motion a series of events that promise to make this the most memorable holiday in quite some time.

Rosenthal. Richard Erdman stars as McNulty, a nonstop talker and crashing bore. Unable to engage anyone in conversation, McNulty decides to manufacture a few "pregnant pauses" of his own with the aid of a magic stopwatch, given to him by a batty barfly named Potts (Leon Belasco). Though essentially a comedy, "A Kind of a Stopwatch" boasts an unusually unsettling denouement(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">A Short Drink from a Certain Fountain</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">A Short Drink from a Certain Fountain. Rod Serling scripted this minimalist Twilight Zone episode from an idea by veteran vaudeville comedian Lou Holtz. Elderly Harmon Gordon (Patrick O'Neal) lives a life of "quiet desperation," knowing full well that his sexy young wife Flora (Ruta Lee) merely married him for his money. Desperate to win Flora's true affections, Harmon prevails upon his doctor brother Raymond (Walter Brooke) to give him an experimental youth potion. The formula works -- all too well. Thanks to a legal entanglement, "A Short Drink from a Certain Fountain" was removed from the Twilight Zone syndication package; the episode was aired but once, on December 13, 1963, then remained in mothballs until it was revived for a two-hour Twilight Zone anniversary special in 1984(n)</desc>

Though the kids are easily bought off, Peg's decision is swayed by one glance at Al's replacement, muscle-bound Sven Hunkstrom (Dan Blom). But in the ninth inning, Sven is injured--so guess who steps up to the pitcher's mound? This episode manages to include virtually every baseball-movie cliché known to man (including a wickedly hilarious send-up of Lou Gehrig's farewell speech), and as a bonus features future Beverly Hills 90210 regular Ian Ziering in a small role(n)</desc>

The Charmed Ones -- better known as Prue, Piper, and Phoebe Halliwell (Shannen Doherty, Holly Marie Combs, Alyssa Milano), continue to perform various acts of benevolent witchcraft gleaned from the "Book of Shadows" as Charmed begins its third season. In the opening episode, Prue and Phoebe witness an attack on their friend Inspector Morris (Dorian Gregory) by a murderer who has been possessed by demons. But when time comes for the girls to offer evidence against the attacker, they refuse to do so, sworn to secrecy by their vows as witches. This brings Prue and Phoebe into the office of new Assistant District Attorney Cole Turner (Julian McMahon in his first series appearance) -- who, as it turns out, has a hidden agenda all his own. Meanwhile, third Halliwell sister Piper may have spent too much time in the realm of the Whitelighters with her guardian angel (and sweetheart) Leo Wyatt (Brian Krause).

    <desc lang="en">Santa's black-sheep brother gets a much-needed shot at redemption in this holiday comedy reuniting actor Vince Vaughn and director David Dobkin (Clay Pigeons, Wedding Crashers). It's not easy being the brother of a benevolent and beloved saint, and no one knows that better than Fred Claus (Vaughn). After struggling for years to live up to the example set by his younger sibling Nicholas (Paul Giamatti), Fred has finally given up. These days Fred is working as a repo man taken to stealing the items he repossesses, and his shady tactics have just landed him in jail. While Mrs. Claus vehemently insists that Fred fend for himself, Nicholas refuses to sit idly by as his brother rots in jail and agrees to set bail if Fred will repay the debt by coming to the North Pole and help make toys for the upcoming Christmas season. But Fred isn't nearly as productive as your average elf, and he's got quite an attitude to boot. With Christmas fast approaching and Fred threatening to sideline Nicholas' entire finely tuned operation, the brother that always struggled to get out from under his sibling's substantial shadow finds out just how far the patience of a saint can be pushed before jolly old Santa reaches his breaking point(n)</desc>
