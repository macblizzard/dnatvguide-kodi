    <title lang="en">Dogs Behaving Badly</title>
    <desc lang="en">Leading dog trainer Graeme Hall - AKA the Dogfather - invites viewers to gain an insight into his work. He believes no canine is a lost cause, claiming he is able to deal with `any dog, any age, any problem'. In this documentary, cameras follow Graeme as he meets a 71-kilo Great Dane from South Shields that intimidates everyone, a jealous poodle in Weymouth with a vendetta against his owner's boyfriend, and a labrador in Warrington that steals food fresh from the oven. Graeme reveals that, in many cases, solving underlying problems with the owners is half the battle in bringing dogs to heel, and here, he forces one couple to reassess their relationship, and prompts members of one family to think differently about their living situation.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A political consultant in the midst of a bitter divorce attempts to delicately divulge the truth about his past relationships to his curious young daughter, who simply won't stop asking questions until she's satisfied with all the answers. Ten-year-old Maya (Abigail Breslin) is heartbroken to see her parents splitting up, but she's determined to find out precisely how it was that mom and dad came together in the first place. When Maya starts questioning her father Will (Ryan Reynolds) about his life before marriage, dad's memories soon drift back to the time when, as a naïve Wisconsin native and aspiring politician hoping to work on the presidential election, he first arrived in New York City. As Will gradually became savvy to the ways of the big city, he gradually developed romantic relationships with three very different women: Emily (Elizabeth Banks) was the girl-next-door that he could always depend on, apolitical April (Isla Fisher) was the best friend and confidante who was always there to listen, and free-spirited journalist Summer (Rachel Weisz) was both beautiful and ambitious. In order to prevent his perceptive little girl from predicting the outcome before his story is told, Will carefully changes the names of his three romantic interests, creating a hopelessly romantic puzzle that highlights both the joys and hardships of true love(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A cop looking for a quieter way of life is thrown into the most dangerous crisis of his life in this thriller based on the novel by Robert Crais. Jeff Talley (Bruce Willis) used to be a hostage negotiator with the Los Angeles Police Department, but after a standoff goes horribly wrong, Talley moves himself and his family to a small, quiet town of Bristo Camino, where he serves as chief of police. When three young criminals attempt to steal a car from a wealthy accountant, the situation quickly spins out of control and the thieves are trapped inside the heavily fortified home, taking the accountant and his family hostage. The Ventura County Sheriff's Department soon arrives on the scene, and Talley eagerly hands over the situation to them, but when he unexpectedly finds himself in telephone contact with one of the children inside, he begins to suspect that the cops are in over their heads. After he's approached by a masked stranger who has an agenda of his own, Talley is forced to decide if he should protect the safety of the family in the house or his own wife and kids. Hostage was the first English-language film from director Florent Emilio Siri(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">If Hollywood can shoehorn William Shakespeare into the teen-movie treatment with Romeo and Juliet, and Jane Austen with Clueless (from her novel, Emma), why not George Bernard Shaw? While his Pygmalion has been staged and filmed endless times, most famously as the musical My Fair Lady, here Shaw goes to high school. This time around, a Los Angeles' school's most popular guy Zack (Freddie Prinze, Jr.) loses his girlfriend Taylor (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) to television star Brock Hudson (Scream's Matthew Lillard). Zack then vows to his friends that he can take any girl in school and turn her into the prom queen. With five weeks until the prom, his friends pick weird, art nerd Laney Boggs (Rachael Leigh Cook). Zack predictably gets more than he bargained for as he falls in love with his "creation." Eldon Hudson and Kieran Culkin, stars of The Mighty, play Laney's best friend and little brother, respectively. Robert Iscove, director of television's Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella, makes his big-screen debut(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Tottenham Hotspur v Millwall (Kick-off 2.00pm). Gary Lineker presents coverage of the sixth-round encounter between the London rivals, which takes place at White Hart Lane. This is the first meeting between these sides since April 1990 in the old First Division, when Gary Lineker scored the only goal to give Tottenham the win. Spurs hold a commanding record against the Lions, having not lost to them since 1939, and will come into this game as heavy favourites. League One Millwall have already eliminated three Premier League sides in Bournemouth, Watford and reigning champions Leicester City to reach this stage, however, so Mauricio Pochettino will not take Neil Harris's side lightly.

    <desc lang="en">Leading dog trainer Graeme Hall - AKA the Dogfather - invites viewers to gain an insight into his work. He believes no canine is a lost cause, claiming he is able to deal with `any dog, any age, any problem'. In this documentary, cameras follow Graeme as he meets a 71-kilo Great Dane from South Shields that intimidates everyone, a jealous poodle in Weymouth with a vendetta against his owner's boyfriend, and a labrador in Warrington that steals food fresh from the oven. Graeme reveals that, in many cases, solving underlying problems with the owners is half the battle in bringing dogs to heel, and here, he forces one couple to reassess their relationship, and prompts members of one family to think differently about their living situation.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">When a wealth of silver is discovered in the vast Nevada desert, the small but almost immediately prosperous boomtown of Rejection is quickly established in order to support the Bottom Dollar Mine. Despite the riches beneath their feet that promise to put Rejection on the map and deliver wealth and prosperity to the small community, the fate of the town takes an ominous turn when 17 miners are mysteriously killed. As the fearful residents abandon the mines and flee the town, mine owner Hiram Gummer (series regular Michael Gross) takes matters into his own hands by leading the few remaining residents in a hunt to solve the mystery of the miners' deaths -- only to discover that the unearthly underground killer is a more powerful force than he may have ever imagined(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Lee Mack's not having much luck with lights these days, whether it's the fizzling sign at the start of this show, the blackout during his recent Sheffield gig, or the dimly lit area at the start of this seventh series. Lee and Lucy have enjoyed a spot of culture at their local cinema, but the sparkle of a French movie is soon diminished when the romantic walk home finds them in an imposing underpass. She has her handbag stolen by a bunch of cocky youths from under his nose. Given the fact the layabout failed to protect her, or come up with an accurate description of their muggers, Lee feels the urge to prove his manliness, but will a spell at the local boxing ring be a help or a hindrance? Sally Bretton and Katy Wix also star.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Around the Horn</title>
    <desc lang="en">Hosted--or rather, refereed--by boxing expert Max Kellerman, this lively cable-TV discussion show featured four sports columnists, each from a different part of the USA, discussing recent pro-athletic developments in a sort of electronic summit meeting. Kellerman determined how much time each of the columnists would be permitted to express his or her opinions--and he was harsh indeed, frequently limiting the discourse to ten seconds or less. At the end of the show, Kellerman would award points for the most cogent opinions and arguments, and also subtract points from contributors whom he determined had not effectively expressed themselves. The inagural episode of ESPN's Around the Horn was seen on September 30, 2002(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Going It Alone.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">A look at the fascinating behaviours exhibited by some of the natural world's most dedicated parents, beginning with a look at those animals that are tasked with raising their offspring alone. Examples include the slow loris covering her baby in toxic saliva, the Weddell seal putting her pup through winter boot camp, a weedy sea dragon camouflaging his eggs against his body and the giant Pacific octopus sacrificing herself for her brood.

    <desc lang="en">Though it takes two to make a baby, it does not necessarily require two to bring it up. So what makes the parents of the animal kingdom decide to stay or go, and if they remain with what degree to involve themselves? Narrator Hugh Dennis observes creatures from a California mouse who has to kick-start her partner's paternal instincts to the Adelie penguin parents who cannot leave their eggs alone for five minutes, and from cheetah mums practising promiscuity to keep the dads on-side, to flamingo parents both producing milk for their young.(n)</desc>

Ridley wrote the screenplay with Michael McCullers, co-writer of the Austin Powers sequels, and it was directed by Malcolm D. Lee (Spike Lee's cousin, and the writer/director of The Best Man). The film stars Eddie Griffin (of TV's Malcolm and Eddie) as Undercover Brother, he of the gold Cadillac convertible and huge Afro, who uses gadgets and disguises to steal from the rich and give to the poor. His activities are discovered by the B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D., a spy organization devoted to subverting The Man (Robert Trumbull) and his henchman, Mr. Feather (Chris Kattan), who use their power over the media to demean black people and destroy racial unity.

They include Sistah Girl (Aunjanue Ellis), a beautiful martial artist, Conspiracy Brother (Dave Chappelle), who sees white supremacist plots everywhere, and Smart Brother (Gary Anthony Williams, who provided the voice of Undercover Brother in the cartoon), who supplies the operatives with gadgets and information.

    <title lang="en">Delta Farce</title>
    <desc lang="en">When a hard-luck blue-collar worker and his two best friends are mistaken for Army Reservists by a tough-talking Army sergeant, the plane set to fly them to the front lines of Iraq mistakenly drops them in the middle of Mexico to disastrous results in a freewheeling military comedy starring Larry the Cable Guy, Bill Engvall, and D.J. Qualls. Larry (the Cable Guy) has lost his job and his woman in the short span of 24 hours. Convinced that some suds and target shooting are just the right remedies for a broken, jobless heart, Larry sets out with his next-door neighbor Bill (Engvall) and their trigger-happy pal Everett (Qualls) in order to blast off some rounds and down some brews. Their relaxing weekend soon takes an unexpected turn, however, when hard-case Army sergeant Kilgrove (Keith David) mistakes the trio as slacking Army reservists and loads them in a plane bound for Fallujah. Subsequently air-dropped over Mexico due to pilot error, the clueless, wannabe war heroes become convinced that they're actually in the Middle East and set out to save a rural village from what they assume to be an insurgent uprising. Though the thankful locals champion the noble but dimwitted trio for their heroism, the celebration is short-lived as ruthless warlord Carlos Santana (Danny Trejo) pays a personal visit to the town with a plan to confront the fearless warriors who dared to challenge his iron-fist rule(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Iron Man 2</title>
    <desc lang="en">As Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) owns up to being Iron Man before the world press, Anton Vanko lies dying in Russia. Years ago, Anton worked with Tony's father to create a new source of energy. But greed got the best of Anton, and now as he slips away, his son, Ivan (Mickey Rourke), vows to make Tony pay for the sins of his father. Meanwhile, Tony fends off efforts from smarmy Senator Stern (Garry Shandling) and military weapons expert Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) to get him to divulge the secrets of his powerful Iron Man suit. The powers that be are concerned that Tony's technology may fall into the wrong hands -- fears that are soon confirmed when the cocky billionaire entrepreneur is confronted in front of the entire world by Ivan, who has built his own weapon using stolen Stark blueprints. Later, as Lt. Rhodes (Don Cheadle) wrestles with the decision to personally deliver Tony's suit to the military, Ivan finds an unlikely ally in the quest to destroy Iron Man; Stark Industries legal consultant Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson) reveals her connection to Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson); and Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) takes on some new responsibilities(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">After six weeks of heats, 60 hopefuls have been whittled down to the most promising six. Now it's the first of the semi-finals, in which they face a big catering challenge - in Albert Square of all places. The busy EastEnders cast and crew have strictly one hour for lunch and their schedule is tight, so the two teams - serving 60 main courses and 60 desserts each from specially constructed tents - cannot be late. After that challenge it's back to the studio to come up with their own refined dish, before Gregg Wallace and John Torode send one of the hopefuls home.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The remaining five contestants enter the kitchens of Hever Castle, Kent, the childhood home of Anne Boleyn, where they cook a menu that pushes them to the limits of their abilities. With the assistance of chef John Campbell, they tackle one course each, which they have four hours to prepare, but must master elements of cuisine they have never attempted before. Their dishes are served to a group of historians - Mary Beard, Terry Deary and Lucy Worsley. Back in the studio, John Torode and Gregg Wallace set another invention test, although this time the choice of ingredients consists of scraps, leftovers and trimmings, including chicken giblets, bones, fish heads, potato peelings and stale bread. Will anyone make a pig's ear of it?.(n)</desc>

The former champ soon receives a much-needed shot at redemption, however, when he is recruited by a determined FBI agent named Rodriguez (George Lopez) to win a coveted spot in the upcoming underground table tennis tournament and ferret out the nefarious Feng (Christopher Walken), whose thriving criminal empire has transformed him into a true menace to society(n)</desc>

Ella (Hathaway) lives in a magical world in which each child, at the moment of their birth, is given a virtuous "gift" from a fairy godmother. Ella's so-called gift, however, is obedience. This birthright proves itself to be quite the curse once Ella finds herself in the hands of several unscrupulous characters whom she quite literally cannot disobey. Determined to gain control of her life and decisions, Ella sets off on a journey she hopes will end with the lifting of the curse in question. The path, however, isn't easy -- Ella must outwit a slew of unpleasant magical creatures ranging from ogres to talking books with evil plots. Though perilous, Ella's adventures turn out to be necessary obstacles in the path toward finding herself, and maybe even true love along the way. Ella Enchanted also features Cary Elwes, who has starred in a fantasy feature himself (the widely acclaimed The Princess Bride), Hugh Dancy, and Patrick Bergin, among others(n)</desc>

Walter Sparrow (Carrey) is a middle-aged dogcatcher whose wife Agatha (Madsen) has bestowed him with an obscure mystery novel detailing the investigation launched by a tough-talking gumshoe named Fingerling (also Carrey) whose every move seems to be overshadowed by the enigmatic eponymous number. After noting a series of alarming parallels shared between the fictional detective and himself, Walter is quickly drawn in to the story as the hard-boiled private investigator murders raven-wigged moll Fabrizia (also Madsen) and pins the crime on her unsuspecting lover (Danny Huston). Back in the real world, fiction seems to merge with reality as Walter and Agatha's close friend Isaac (also Huston) begins to ingratiate himself ever deeper into the couple's relationship and Walter begins experiencing a gruesome series of visions in which he violently murders an unfaithful Agatha. His mind fast descending into a dark and violent whirlwind of madness, Walter enlists the aid of Agatha and the pair's adolescent son Robin (Logan Lerman) in seeking out the author of the mysterious tome and uncovering the sinister truth behind the so-called "23 enigma."(n)</desc>

After a mysterious accident lands Devlin in the hospital, Tong learns that his new boss has a secret -- when he's not wheeling and dealing in high finance, Devlin is also a secret agent for the CSA, a top-level security agency.

    <title lang="en">Dallas Buyers Club</title>
    <desc lang="en">Matthew McConaughey headlines director Jean-Marc Vallée's biographical drama centering on the story of Ron Woodroof, a Texas electrician who was diagnosed as HIV-positive in 1986, and who subsequently devoted his life to providing fellow HIV patients with non-FDA-approved drugs and supplements during an era when doctors were still struggling to understand the devastating disease. Defying his surprise death sentence, Woodroof set out to procure any and all non-toxic alternative HIV treatments available, and established a "buyers club" to provide the treatments to others afflicted with the disease. But that mission quickly made him a target for both the U.S. medical establishment and the pharmaceutical industry, both of which resented his defiance of government sanctions, and joined forces to shut down his operation by any means necessary(n)</desc>

Beth Raymond (Sossamon) is a college student whose friends have all been dying in droves, and the one connecting factor between all of the incidents is that just before their deaths, each of the victims received a message in which they heard themselves being murdered. Upon receiving her own frightening phone call, Beth has only three days to solve the mystery and cheat death.

    <title lang="en">Heartbreakers</title>
    <desc lang="en">After the little white lies of Romy and Michele's High School Reunion (1997), director David Mirkin focuses on scheming of a different sort in Heartbreakers. Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt play Max and Page Conners, a mother and daughter who share everything with each other: relationship advice, hair and makeup hints, and the money they win in costly divorce settlements with rich men. When the film opens, the Conners are putting the finishing touches on conning Dean (Ray Liotta), an auto-body shop owner. When the dust from that scam clears, Page announces she's ready to move away from her mother and set up shop on her own -- but in order to clear an outstanding debt, Max insists they bankrupt one more bachelor together. They settle upon phlegmatic Palm Springs widower William B. Tensy (Gene Hackman), a chain smoker with a heart of gold and a similarly bountiful bank account. Only two things stand in their way: Tensy's Teutonic caretaker Miss Madress (Nora Dunn) and beachfront bartender Jack (Jason Lee), a wry stargazer with whom Page becomes unexpectedly smitten. Heartbreakers is the third collaboration from writers Steven Mazur and Paul Guy, whose previous screwball comedy was 1997's international hit, Liar Liar(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Miami Rhapsody</title>
    <desc lang="en">The discovery of marital troubles in her family causes a young woman to question her own upcoming nuptials in this clever romantic comedy. Sarah Jessica Parker stars as Gwyn, a bright, slightly neurotic advertising copywriter who is initially thrilled when her boyfriend Matt (Gil Bellows) finally proposes. Soon afterwards, however, she learns that her mother Nina (Mia Farrow) is indulging in an extra-marital affair with a handsome Latin stud (Antonio Banderas). This is only the first of several shocking revelations, as Gwyn soon learns of infidelity by her father (Paul Mazursky), brother (Kevin Pollack), and even newlywed sister (Carla Gugino). These indiscretions make Gwyn question the validity of the entire institution of marriage and doubt her own future. Director David Frankel, who also penned the screenplay, follows in the footsteps of Woody Allen in using introspective dialogue to detail the romantic troubles of a wealthy, neurotic Jewish family; practiced performances and a colorful use of Miami locations give the film its own personality(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Italy v France.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Italy v France (Kick-off 1.30pm). Coverage of the clash in the penultimate weekend of fixtures, which takes place at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome. Italy's innovative tactics against England in their last match caused a great deal of debate and they will be looking to build on their improvement at Twickenham as they welcome the French. Les Bleus hold the overall advantage in Test matches between the sides and have not been beaten by the Italians since 2013. The Azzurri ran them close in last year's match, however, with Sergio Parisse's last-gasp drop goal attempt dragged wide as Italy fell just short of a first-ever Six Nations win in Paris, going down 23-21 at the Stade de France. Jill Douglas presents, with analysis from Gareth Thomas, Maggie Alphonsi and Marco Bortolami, commentary by Miles Harrison, Ben Kay and Shane Williams, and pitchside reports from Olivier Magne.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">England v Scotland.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">England v Scotland (Kick-off 4.00pm). All the action from the fixture between the great rivals, which takes place at Twickenham. This match will go a long way to deciding the destination of the Triple Crown, as Scotland have already defeated Wales and Ireland, while England led the standings after the first three rounds as they look to secure back-to-back Grand Slams. Eddie Jones's side are the current holders of the Calcutta Cup, and haven't been beaten by the Scots since 2008. Going even further back, the last time Scotland were victorious on English soil came in 1983 - their only win of that year's Five Nations championship - so head coach Vern Cotter will know his side have their work cut out for them in this contest. Mark Pougatch presents, with analysis from Clive Woodward, Ian McGeechan, Jonny Wilkinson and Greig Laidlaw, commentary by Nick Mullins, Lawrence Dallaglio and Scott Hastings, and pitchside reports from Martin Bayfield and Jim Hamilton.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Architect Dermot Bannon returns to offer more members of the public help with innovative design projects that should revolutionise their homes without calling for them to move. He begins in Puckaun, Co Tipperary, where teacher Darragh Egan, his partner Sarah Lovett and his 70-year-old mother Mary are seeking to convert their shared 1960s bungalow into two, self-contained wings. One will be for Mary, the other for Darragh, Sarah and their infant son Donagh. However, demolition delays caused by the existing building's foot-thick floors and walls leave local contractor Brendan Cormican and quality surveyor Patricia Power struggling to square Dermot's vision with the 200,000-euro budget.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Italy v France (Kick-off 1.30pm). Coverage of the clash in the penultimate weekend of fixtures, which takes place at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome. Italy's innovative tactics against England in their last match caused a great deal of debate and they will be looking to build on their improvement at Twickenham as they welcome the French. Les Bleus hold the overall advantage in Test matches between the sides and have not been beaten by the Italians since 2013. The Azzurri ran them close in last year's match, however, with Sergio Parisse's last-gasp drop goal attempt dragged wide as Italy fell just short of a first-ever Six Nations win in Paris, going down 23-21 at the Stade de France. Presented by Daire O'Brien, with commentary by George Hmailton and Ralph Keyes, and analysis from Brent Pope, Eddie O'Sullivan and Shane Horgan.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">England v Scotland.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">England v Scotland (Kick-off 4.00pm). All the action from the fixture between the great rivals, which takes place at Twickenham. This match will go a long way to deciding the destination of the Triple Crown, as Scotland have already defeated Wales and Ireland, while England led the standings after the first three rounds as they look to secure back-to-back Grand Slams. Eddie Jones's side are the current holders of the Calcutta Cup, and haven't been beaten by the Scots since 2008. Going even further back, the last time Scotland were victorious on English soil came in 1983 - their only win of that year's Five Nations championship - so head coach Vern Cotter will know his side have their work cut out for them in this contest. Presented by Daire O'Brien, with commentary by Hugh Cahill and Donal Lenihan, and analysis from Brent Pope, Eddie O'Sullivan and Shane Horgan.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The broadcaster explores the Galapagos, a collection of volcanic islands in the Pacific known for its extraordinary wildlife. More than 150 years after Charles Darwin formulated his ground-breaking theory of evolution on the remote archipelago, Attenborough explains how life on the islands has continued to evolve in biological isolation, examining how the ever-changing volcanic landscape has given birth to species and sub-species that exist nowhere else in the world. He begins by revealing how Galapagos rose from the ocean four million years ago.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Tyler Perry's Meet the Browns</title>
    <desc lang="en">Prolific playwright Tyler Perry adapts his popular stage play of the same name in this family-oriented comedy concerning a desperate mother who connects with the family she never knew. Brenda is a single Chicago mother of three who has been struggling for years to keep her kids off of the streets. Suddenly let go from her job with no warning to speak of, the eternally optimistic mother begins to experience a suffocating sense of hopelessness for the very first time in her life. When Brenda receives a death notice claiming that the father she has never met has passed away, she quickly gathers up the kids and sets out for Georgia to attend the funeral. Upon arriving in the Deep South, the once fretful mother is pleasantly surprised to discover that there is a whole side of the family she never knew existed. A crass but good-natured clan that welcomes Brenda and her children with open arms, the Browns' lazy summer afternoons and frequent trips to the county fair offer a much-needed contrast to the stress of surviving in inner city Chicago. Writer/director/actor Perry reprises his role as indomitable, law-breaking grandmother Madea in a comedy that proves sometimes second chances come when you least expect it(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Tyler Perry's Meet the Browns</title>
    <desc lang="en">Prolific playwright Tyler Perry adapts his popular stage play of the same name in this family-oriented comedy concerning a desperate mother who connects with the family she never knew. Brenda is a single Chicago mother of three who has been struggling for years to keep her kids off of the streets. Suddenly let go from her job with no warning to speak of, the eternally optimistic mother begins to experience a suffocating sense of hopelessness for the very first time in her life. When Brenda receives a death notice claiming that the father she has never met has passed away, she quickly gathers up the kids and sets out for Georgia to attend the funeral. Upon arriving in the Deep South, the once fretful mother is pleasantly surprised to discover that there is a whole side of the family she never knew existed. A crass but good-natured clan that welcomes Brenda and her children with open arms, the Browns' lazy summer afternoons and frequent trips to the county fair offer a much-needed contrast to the stress of surviving in inner city Chicago. Writer/director/actor Perry reprises his role as indomitable, law-breaking grandmother Madea in a comedy that proves sometimes second chances come when you least expect it(n)</desc>

Shortly after earning his degree, Paul Dynan (Kevin Zegers) realizes the certificate in his hand is barely worth the paper it's printed on. Subsequently drowning in a sea of debt due to his student loans and his mother's medical bills, the disillusioned graduate hits a breaking point as the bank prepares to foreclose on his family home, and devises a plan to earn some quick cash while giving the rich a lesson in humility. His plan: abduct three privileged socialites with the help of two young deviants, and make their fathers (Ray Liotta, Victor Garber), and Stephen McHattie) fork over $3 million for their safe return. Unfortunately for Paul, the bitter infighting between his three affluent targets is about to blow the plan sky high, and offer a painful lesson in the perils of crime(n)</desc>

It's all greasy spoons and low-rent ethnic eateries in the world of seasoned big-city health inspector Larry (Larry the Cable Guy), and that's just the way he likes it. After begrudgingly accepting the task of training by-the-books trainee Amy (Iris Bahr), Larry lands the biggest case of his career when a group of high-class diners fall ill following a particularly pricey meal. Though the gruff but lovable health inspector soon loses his job as a direct result of his questionable manners, he soon wins the heart of a shy waitress while attempting to go undercover to crack the case and ensure that the conspirators who engineered the poisonous plan are brought to justice(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">When a hard-luck blue-collar worker and his two best friends are mistaken for Army Reservists by a tough-talking Army sergeant, the plane set to fly them to the front lines of Iraq mistakenly drops them in the middle of Mexico to disastrous results in a freewheeling military comedy starring Larry the Cable Guy, Bill Engvall, and D.J. Qualls. Larry (the Cable Guy) has lost his job and his woman in the short span of 24 hours. Convinced that some suds and target shooting are just the right remedies for a broken, jobless heart, Larry sets out with his next-door neighbor Bill (Engvall) and their trigger-happy pal Everett (Qualls) in order to blast off some rounds and down some brews. Their relaxing weekend soon takes an unexpected turn, however, when hard-case Army sergeant Kilgrove (Keith David) mistakes the trio as slacking Army reservists and loads them in a plane bound for Fallujah. Subsequently air-dropped over Mexico due to pilot error, the clueless, wannabe war heroes become convinced that they're actually in the Middle East and set out to save a rural village from what they assume to be an insurgent uprising. Though the thankful locals champion the noble but dimwitted trio for their heroism, the celebration is short-lived as ruthless warlord Carlos Santana (Danny Trejo) pays a personal visit to the town with a plan to confront the fearless warriors who dared to challenge his iron-fist rule(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">There's Something About Mary</title>
    <desc lang="en">Ben Stiller plays high school geek Ted, invited to the prom by the gorgeous Mary. He can hardly believe his luck; but the night goes wrong when he arrives to pick up his date, and has a painful accident in the toilet, failing to stow his tackle before zipping up. Thirteen years later Ted still yearns for what might have been and hires private dick Pat Healy to find Mary. The detective succeeds but also falls for her and feeds Ted false information so he can keep her for himself. But a suspicious Ted takes matters into his own hands and finds he's in the middle of a love pentagon also involving an architect and an NFL quarterback. With the addition of gags involving a speed-freaked dog, Mary's use of what she believes is Ted's hair gel and a minstrel troupe who follow Ted around, the resulting comedy may not be subtle but is very funny(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Delta Farce</title>
    <desc lang="en">When a hard-luck blue-collar worker and his two best friends are mistaken for Army Reservists by a tough-talking Army sergeant, the plane set to fly them to the front lines of Iraq mistakenly drops them in the middle of Mexico to disastrous results in a freewheeling military comedy starring Larry the Cable Guy, Bill Engvall, and D.J. Qualls. Larry (the Cable Guy) has lost his job and his woman in the short span of 24 hours. Convinced that some suds and target shooting are just the right remedies for a broken, jobless heart, Larry sets out with his next-door neighbor Bill (Engvall) and their trigger-happy pal Everett (Qualls) in order to blast off some rounds and down some brews. Their relaxing weekend soon takes an unexpected turn, however, when hard-case Army sergeant Kilgrove (Keith David) mistakes the trio as slacking Army reservists and loads them in a plane bound for Fallujah. Subsequently air-dropped over Mexico due to pilot error, the clueless, wannabe war heroes become convinced that they're actually in the Middle East and set out to save a rural village from what they assume to be an insurgent uprising. Though the thankful locals champion the noble but dimwitted trio for their heroism, the celebration is short-lived as ruthless warlord Carlos Santana (Danny Trejo) pays a personal visit to the town with a plan to confront the fearless warriors who dared to challenge his iron-fist rule(n)</desc>

He can hardly believe his luck; but the night goes wrong when he arrives to pick up his date, and has a painful accident in the toilet, failing to stow his tackle before zipping up. Thirteen years later Ted still yearns for what might have been and hires private dick Pat Healy to find Mary. The detective succeeds but also falls for her and feeds Ted false information so he can keep her for himself. But a suspicious Ted takes matters into his own hands and finds he's in the middle of a love pentagon also involving an architect and an NFL quarterback. With the addition of gags involving a speed-freaked dog, Mary's use of what she believes is Ted's hair gel and a minstrel troupe who follow Ted around, the resulting comedy may not be subtle but is very funny(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Delta Farce</title>
    <desc lang="en">When a hard-luck blue-collar worker and his two best friends are mistaken for Army Reservists by a tough-talking Army sergeant, the plane set to fly them to the front lines of Iraq mistakenly drops them in the middle of Mexico to disastrous results in a freewheeling military comedy starring Larry the Cable Guy, Bill Engvall, and D.J. Qualls. Larry (the Cable Guy) has lost his job and his woman in the short span of 24 hours. Convinced that some suds and target shooting are just the right remedies for a broken, jobless heart, Larry sets out with his next-door neighbor Bill (Engvall) and their trigger-happy pal Everett (Qualls) in order to blast off some rounds and down some brews. Their relaxing weekend soon takes an unexpected turn, however, when hard-case Army sergeant Kilgrove (Keith David) mistakes the trio as slacking Army reservists and loads them in a plane bound for Fallujah. Subsequently air-dropped over Mexico due to pilot error, the clueless, wannabe war heroes become convinced that they're actually in the Middle East and set out to save a rural village from what they assume to be an insurgent uprising. Though the thankful locals champion the noble but dimwitted trio for their heroism, the celebration is short-lived as ruthless warlord Carlos Santana (Danny Trejo) pays a personal visit to the town with a plan to confront the fearless warriors who dared to challenge his iron-fist rule(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Following the life of cocaine-trafficking pioneer George Jung in a way that recalls Martin Scorsese's Casino, Blow recounts the man's days from his 1950s childhood in Boston to his downfall in the 1980s. George (played by Johnny Depp) begins his life as the son of Fred (Ray Liotta), an earnest breadwinner, and Ermine (Rachel Griffiths), who frequently walks out on them in pursuit of a more fulfilling life. When George moves west to California in the late '60s, accompanied by best pal Tuna (Ethan Suplee), he becomes an entrepreneur in the marijuana business, which soon spreads to the East Coast as well, with girlfriend Barbara (Franka Potente) smuggling the product during her stewardess shifts. George is arrested in 1972 -- at which time Barbara dies of cancer -- but George finds a new ally in Diego (Jordi Molla), who proposes the idea that he become the American conduit for Colombian kingpin Pablo Escobar (Cliff Curtis). George flourishes in the heyday of the disco era, and falls for Mirtha (Penelope Cruz), a self-serving bombshell who eventually has a daughter with him. Trouble escalates as the FBI threatens to bring George and his crew down, while he desperately tries to be a stable parent to his young offspring. Blow also features Paul Reubens and Max Perlich in featured roles(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Butterfly</title>
    <desc lang="en">Veteran director Jose Luis Cuerda delivered this sensitive portrait of a child coming of age during a tense political situation just before the Spanish Civil War. On his first day of school, frail eight-year-old Moncho (Manuel Lozano) is so terrified by the imposing figure of his teacher Don Gregorio (Fernando Fernan Gomez) that he flees into the nearby woods. In spite of his authoritarian appearance, the schoolmaster proves to be a kind, free-thinking Republican who teaches Moncho the virtues of being good. The boy is soon spending much of his time with the elderly Gregorio in the Galician countryside, admiring such wonders of nature as the tongue of a butterfly. Other people in young Moncho's world include his down-to-earth mother (Uxia Blanco), his Republican father, and his older brother, who plays the saxophone with a group of local musicians. However, when the Fascists roll into town, the boy's life changes forever. La Lengua de las Mariposas was screened at the 1999 San Sebastian Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A shrewd young advertising executive gets recruited to help free Chile from the grip of dictator Augusto Pinochet in this historical drama set during a defining chapter in nation's history. The year is 1988. Pinochet has ruled Chile without challenge for nearly two decades, but all of this could soon change as the international community pressures the despot to hold a national election that will decide whether he retains his position for another eight years. Should the citizens vote "Yes," Pinochet will remain in power; should they vote "No," the country will elect a new leader. Though the population remains convinced that the election is fixed, the chance to enact change through peaceful means is too powerful to resist. In order to succeed, the opposition recruits bright young ad exec René Saavedra (Gael García Bernal) to create the daily, 15-minute television spots that will help to ensure a "No" vote. But Saavedra knows that if the citizens stay home during the elections the "Yes" vote will certainly win, and focuses as much on getting cynical Chileans to the polls as he does promising them a brighter future. Meanwhile Lucho Guzmán (Alfredo Castro), Saavedra's intimidating counterpart on the "Yes" campaign, does everything in his power to shut down the "No" vote. With the fate of an entire nation hanging in the balance of the outcome, however, Saavedra braves intimidation and death threats in order to ensure his country will be freed from the grip of tyranny(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Pollock</title>
    <desc lang="en">Artist Jackson Pollock revolutionized American painting in the 1940's with his exciting abstract canvases that used dripped and splattered paint in a manner at once excitingly physical and structurally intelligent. While Pollock became a heroic figure in the art world, his private life was nothing to envy, and this biography looks at both his professional triumphs and personal tragedies. In 1941, Pollock (Ed Harris) was a bitter and struggling painter when he met Lee Krasner (Marcia Gay Harden), a fellow artist with whom he was appearing in a joint gallery show. Krasner was intrigued by Pollock, and immediately sensed the importance of his work; they quickly became lovers, and as Krasner realized his superior talent, she began devoting herself to promoting Pollock's work. When Peggy Guggenheim (Amy Madigan) agreed to present a show of Pollock's paintings at her Art of This Century gallery, his name was made, and a profile in Life magazine solidified his reputation as one of the art world's most important figures. But success did not bring Pollock peace of mind; while he long had a taste for alcohol, his new fame sent his drinking out of control, and his infidelity with numerous women (including Guggenheim) eventually destroyed his relationship with Krasner. Pollock was the first feature directed by actor Ed Harris, who also plays the title role; the cast also includes Val Kilmer as artist Willem de Kooning and Jennifer Connelly as Ruth Kligman, one of Pollock's lovers(n)</desc>

He can hardly believe his luck; but the night goes wrong when he arrives to pick up his date, and has a painful accident in the toilet, failing to stow his tackle before zipping up. Thirteen years later Ted still yearns for what might have been and hires private dick Pat Healy to find Mary. The detective succeeds but also falls for her and feeds Ted false information so he can keep her for himself. But a suspicious Ted takes matters into his own hands and finds he's in the middle of a love pentagon also involving an architect and an NFL quarterback. With the addition of gags involving a speed-freaked dog, Mary's use of what she believes is Ted's hair gel and a minstrel troupe who follow Ted around, the resulting comedy may not be subtle but is very funny(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Which Way Is Up?</title>
    <desc lang="en">This Americanized remake of Lina Wertmuller's The Seduction of Mimi offered audiences the novelty of seeing Richard Pryor performing three different roles in the same film. Which Way Is Up? tells the tale of Leroy Jones (Pryor), a poor orange picker who gets fired from his job when he accidentally joins a worker's union during a demonstration. He is forced to travel to Los Angeles and abandon his family, which includes his wife, Annie Mae (Margaret Avery), and his perpetually randy father, Rufus (also Pryor). While there, he falls in love with labor organizer Vanetta (Lonette McKee), but is soon rehired by his former employers when they realize he is easily manipulated. Back home, Leroy discovers his new managerial role alienates him from his former friends as he tries to divide his time between Annie Mae and Vanetta. When he discovers Annie Mae has been impregnated by the Reverend Lennox Thomas (Pryor's 3rd role) during his absence, Leroy sets his sights on seducing Lennox's wife. The resulting film had ambition to spare, but was generally panned as an inferior remake by the critics and failed to find a mass audience. However, Which Way Is Up? gained a second lease on life via cable and home video and has become a cult favorite with Pryor's fans(n)</desc>

Arthur Hunnicutt stars as backwoodsman Hyder Simpson, who despite the dire predictions of his superstitious wife Rachel (Jeanette Nolan) embarks upon a hunting expedition with his faithful dog Rip. While chasing down their quarry, Hyder and Rip fall into a river and drown -- then promptly return home in ghostly form, to find Rachel weeping over Hyder's coffin. Not altogether convinced that he is dead, Hyder wanders the countryside in search of answers -- while Rip uses his still-acute sense of smell to save Hyder from making the biggest mistake of his life -- or death!(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Showdown with Rance McGrew. Larry Blyden stars in this hilarious Twilight Zone entry as egocentric TV western star Rance McGrew, who, while filming a fight scene, is knocked cold by a prop bottle. Upon awakening, Rance finds himself in the real west, circa 1880 -- and at the mercy of none other than Jesse James (Arch Johnson). It seems that old Jesse isn't too thrilled as to how he and his fellow outlaws have been depicted on Rance's series, and he intends to teach the vainglorious actor a lesson. Best line: "And you won an Emmy? Shoot, you can't act any better than you can draw!" This episode reunited two alumni of the classic 1951 sci-fi thriller The Thing: actor Robert Cornthwaite, and director Christian Nyby. Scripted by Rod Serling from an idea by Frederic Louis Fox (which in its original form wasn't a comedy at all), "Showdown with Rance McGrew" first aired February 2, 1962(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This buddy comedy from the Farrelly brothers stars Jason Sudeikis and Owen Wilson as a couple of married guys who persuade their wives to give them the ultimate "get out of jail free" card: a marriage "hall pass." The agreement gives them free reign to behave like bachelors -- free from the rules and confines of fidelity, responsibility, and married life -- for one week. But soon the guys find that the small town where everybody knows them -- and their wives -- isn't very conducive to chasing tail. And making matters worse, it turns out to be harder than they thought to accept the idea of their wives (Jenna Fischer and Christina Applegate) taking off for vacation on a hall pass of their own(n)</desc>

Will Stronghold (Michael Angarano) has his share of anxieties about starting high school, but once he arrives on campus, he discovers he's attending Sky High, a special learning facility for the children of superheroes. Will realizes his father is actually super-human crime fighter Captain Stronghold (Kurt Russell), while his mom is fellow champion Josie Jetstream (Kelly Preston). However, in Will's first few days at school, Coach Boomer (Bruce Campbell) is unable to discover any superior abilities in him, meaning that instead of joining the school's budding heroes, he's been relegated to the ranks of the lowly sidekicks. In time, Will discovers he happens to have super strength after all, but will he learn to hone his new gifts in time to fend off the bullies at school, get the girl of his dreams, and save his folks from a longtime nemesis? Sky High also features Lynda Carter, Dave Foley, and Kevin McDonald(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey</title>
    <desc lang="en">Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) joins Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and a band of dwarves led by the brave Thorin (Richard Armitage) on a treacherous quest to reclaim their mountain home from the fierce dragon Smaug in this epic fantasy adventure adapted from J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved novel by the creative forces behind the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Long before Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) made his arduous journey to Mordor, his brave uncle Bilbo embarked on an adventure for the ages. Bilbo's story gets under way when the great wizard Gandalf appears at his front gate with a most unusual offer. Displaced from their massive fortress in the Lonely Mountain by Smaug - a greedy dragon who coveted their gold - a community of noble dwarves were decimated by a surprise attack by monstrous orcs, whose dreaded leader the Pale Orc slew their king in a gruesome battle. Now, Thorin, the descendent of the king, is determined to reclaim his mountain kingdom for his people. Together with a fearless team of dwarves, Thorin and Gandalf recruit Bilbo to aid them in their quest since Hobbits have the unique ability to go undetected when they wish to. Before Bilbo, Gandalf, and the dwarves can reach The Lonely Mountain and defeat Smaug, however, they'll have to contend with trolls, goblins, stone giants, Gollum (Andy Serkis), and even the dreaded Pale Orc himself. Peter Jackson directs a screenplay he co-penned with Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, and Guillermo del Toro(n)</desc>
