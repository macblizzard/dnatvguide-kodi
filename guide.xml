    <desc lang="en">At the age of 33, Sharon Hill weighed 46 stone. Hardly able to move, she could not leave her house - meaning her husband and main carer was effectively imprisoned too. In an attempt to turn her life around, she chose to undergo bariatric surgery - as seen in the 2015 documentary operation Shut-ins: Britain's Fattest People. Now cameras return to find how Sharon has shed 14 stone. But having started to put the pounds on again, she is considering a second procedure. Can she finally live a life beyond the confines of her house?.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">I Am Legend</title>
    <desc lang="en">Adapted from acclaimed author Richard Matheson's influential novelette of the same name, Constantine director Francis Lawrence's I Am Legend follows the last man on Earth as he struggles to survive while fending off the infected survivors of a devastating vampiric plague. A brilliant scientist who raced to discover a cure for the man-made virus as humanity came crumbling down all around him, Robert Neville (Will Smith) was inexplicably immune to the highly contagious superbug. Now the entire population of New York City -- and perhaps the world -- has been transformed into carnivorous bloodsuckers that fear the light and live solely to spread their contagion to any remaining living creature that crosses their path. It's been three years since civilization came to an end, and the loneliness has taken a devastating toll on Neville. By day he scours the city for food and supplies while sending out desperate radio messages in hopes that someone might respond, and by night he attempts to find a way to reverse the effects of the virus by experimenting with his own blood. But time is running out for Neville as the legions of infected watch his every move from the safety of the shadows, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. They, too, long to learn the secret that lurks in Neville's blood, though they will have to take caution while attempting to procure it because Neville will sooner die attempting to slay every last one of them than willingly giving up a single drop. Previously adapted for the screen in the 1964 Vincent Price frightener The Last Man on Earth and the 1971 Charlton Heston action film The Omega Man, Matheson's novelette also served as the inspiration for George A. Romero's groundbreaking zombie classic Night of the Living Dead(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Ghost World</title>
    <desc lang="en">Filmmaker Terry Zwigoff, who enjoyed breakthrough success with his 1994 documentary Crumb, shifts gears as he examines the lives of two young women on the verge of leaving their adolescence behind in his first dramatic feature. Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) are two close friends who've just graduated from high school, and are trying to decide what to do with their lives. Enid is a dark-haired arch cynic who is tired of living at home with her ineffectual dad (Bob Balaban) and his annoyingly perky girlfriend Maxine (Teri Garr), while Rebecca is prettier and a bit cheerier, but no more certain about her future. While the two girls have vague plans of getting an apartment together, they seem content to while away their summer hanging out and indulging in their shared infatuation with Josh (Brad Renfro), a friend from school who works at a convenience store and doesn't seem to be especially attracted to either of them. Enid discovers that in order to get her diploma, she'll have to take an additional class over the summer, where she winds up studying art with Roberta (Illeana Douglas), who is determined to encourage Enid's creative impulses, whether Enid likes it or not. More significantly, Enid meets Seymour (Steve Buscemi), a geeky record collector more than twice her age, and while they would seem to have little in common (and Rebecca thinks he's a creep), Enid discovers a kindred spirit in fellow misfit Seymour, who shares her disgust with the world around them, and a relationship begins to develop between the two. Ghost World is based on the award-winning graphic novel by comic artist Daniel Clowes, who also wrote the film's screenplay(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Guy Ritchie, best known for the tough-guy crime comedies Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, goes for a change of pace with this remake of Lina Wertmuller's 1974 comedy-drama, with his wife Madonna in tow. Amber Leighton (Madonna) is the wife of Dr. Anthony Leighton (Bruce Greenwood), the wealthy and successful head of a pharmaceutical company. While Amber seemingly leads a charmed life, it doesn't appear to make her very happy, and she often inflicts her typically foul mood on those around her, especially the hired help. Anthony decides to surprise Amber with a cruise from Italy to Greece, with four of their friends in tow, but Amber doesn't much care for the notion. Amber feels the yacht they've hired is far beneath her standards, and she makes Giuseppe (Adriano Giannini), the first mate of the crew, the primary target of her dissatisfaction. Giuseppe, an ardent leftist, feels nothing but contempt for Amber, but for the sake of his job he can't say a word in response to her attacks. One day, Amber declines an invitation to go diving with her friends, but later changes her mind, demanding that Giuseppe take her to the underwater caves. Giuseppe warns Amber that a storm is brewing, and his prediction proves to be right on the money; soon, Amber and Giuseppe are stranded on a desert island, and suddenly they discover the tables are turned. Giuseppe, a trained fisherman and outdoorsman, knows how to survive on the island, while Amber is utterly helpless, and he forces her to cower under his commands in order to survive; before long, their mutual antagonism has begun to turn into something approaching unfettered lust. Adriano Giannini, who plays Giuseppe, is the son of Giancarlo Giannini, who played the equivalent role in Wertmuller's original film(n)</desc>

Ultimately, the mother and daughter are able to relocate to an apartment, which, despite its excessively dilapidated interior, seems to be an adequate location for beginning a new life. Before long, however, what appears to be the spirit of a young girl begins to haunt them. No stranger to mental illness, the wary young woman brushes the visions aside as part of the inherent stress of making the transition from housewife to working, single mom. As time goes by and the apparent haunting does not subside, the apartment's new residents are forced to examine the history of its former tenants. Dark Water also features performances from John C.

    <desc lang="en">After successfully seeking out the ultimate slider in the 2004 stoner comedy Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle, the cannabis-craving twosome returns in this high-flying sequel that finds them labeled terrorists for attempting to sneak a marijuana-smoking implement on a flight to Amsterdam. Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) have just finished gorging themselves on savory White Castle hamburgers when they return to their apartment and hatch a plan for Harold to win the heart of his crush, Maria (Paula Garcés). Maria is going to Amsterdam, and if Harold can catch up with her overseas perhaps he can strike up a real love connection. After a close call with airport personnel and a chance encounter with Kumar's ex-girlfriend Vanessa (Danneel Harris) -- who hadn't yet told Kumar that she's engaged to be married -- the pot-loving pals finally board their flight for Amsterdam. Unfortunately for Harold, Kumar isn't able to endure the lengthy flight without an innocent puff or two from his smokeless bong. When the plane hits some turbulence and the bong is mistaken for a bomb, the flight is diverted to Guantanamo Bay and our spliff-smoking heroes are detained by overzealous Deputy Chief of Homeland Security Ron Fox (Rob Corddry). Now, if they can just escape from the world's most notorious prison compound, perhaps this hapless duo can succeed in convincing the authorities that they aren't enemy combatants, and that Kumar made the mistake of his life by letting Vanessa go. But before they can prove their innocence and get the girls, Harold and Kumar will have to outsmart the dreaded Ku Klux Klan, contend with a particularly precocious Cyclops baby, and successfully elude everyone's favorite debauched former child star -- Neil Patrick Harris(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Tower Bridge.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">For years, London's East End was denied a new bridge because of the need to guarantee passage of ships up and down the Thames. For years, the greatest engineers of the age hunted for a design that would keep both road and water traffic moving. As Rob Bell explains, the solution came from architect Horace Jones, whose revolutionary design, with its thousand-tonne opening sections, was powered by nothing more than water. Rob also explains the bridge was lucky to survive the Second World War, having been a target for German V-1 flying bombs.(n)</desc>

Wildlife cameraman Gordon Buchanan hopes to get closer to wild wolves than anyone before to discover the true nature of this feared predator and heads to the north of Canada in search of a pack that has never seen people and so has no fear of humans. He begins to gain the trust of an Arctic wolf family and as time passes becomes accepted by the pack, including a female and its three newborn pups, and has some close encounters that reveal a softer side to the animals.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah</title>
    <desc lang="en">The intricately plotted 18th Godzilla film involves time-travel to a remote island in 1944, Terminator 2-type cyborgs, and cute bat-mites called Dorats merging to form Ghidorah, who is killed by Godzilla in 1992 and resurrected as a half-metal flying machine to put down the big lizard. There's a lisping American commander aided by a "Major Spielberg," references to Tetsuo and Peter Arnett, and time-traveling villains out to keep Japan from becoming the world's most powerful economic force. The cluttered plot doesn't hurt the film much, as nearly everything else in this episode is a throwback to the Godzilla films of 30 years ago. There are still colossal battles between men in ratty monster suits and mysterious secret agents plotting to take over the world. The effects quality hasn't improved in the slightest, the theme music is the same, and the man playing Ghidorah appears to be wearing the original suit from 1964. These are, of course, positives for those who love the old films more than the big-budget remake. The fight scenes are fun, the M-11 cyborg is laughably silly, and the metal Ghidorah is impressive. Overall, this is a hokey but entertaining addition to the series, which continued with Gojira Tai Supeisugojira (1994)(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Purge: Anarchy</title>
    <desc lang="en">A vengeful father comes to the aid of a mother, her teenage daughter, and a defenseless young couple on the one night of the year that all crime, including murder, is legal in this self-contained sequel from co-producer Jason Blum and original Purge writer/director James DeMonaco. As the countdown to the Purge starts ticking, struggling waitress Eva (Carmen Ejogo) risks her safety by staying late at work to ask her boss for a raise. Later, as she returns home to her elderly father (John Beasley) and daughter Cali (Zoë Soul), bickering couple Shane (Zach Gilford) and Liz (Kiele Sanchez) attempt to make their way out of the city following a frightening run-in with a gang of masked, machete-wielding thugs. While these five people are eager to seek sanctuary from the impending wave of violence about to flood the streets, a lone stranger (Frank Grillo) intent on seeking vengeance for the wrongful death of his son plans to draw blood from the man responsible. Armed to the teeth as he cruises the city in a modified muscle car, he gets sidetracked from his mission when he sees Eva and Cali fighting for their lives against a small army of black-clad soldiers. Against his better judgment, he rescues the pair, only realizing later that Shane and Liz also jumped into his backseat in order to escape a gang that disabled their car and were hunting them through the streets. When the stranger's car is similarly damaged beyond the point of repair, this unlikely group must stick together in order to survive the night. But little do they realize that their nightmare has only just begun(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">After last week's baked Alaska scandal - which led to Iain hanging up his apron and has since also seen Diana leave the show - judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood assess the remaining contestants' pastry skills. They begin with a signature challenge of a sweet custard tart of their own invention, ranging from rhubarb and custard to tropical Manchester tart. The technical round involves recreating Paul's recipe for mini pear pies, followed by their showpiece bake - a towering collection of three-tiered pies in just four hours. Along the way, Mel Giedroyc investigates the history of an ancient wedding centrepiece known as Bride Pie.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">(2008) Danny Boyle's eight Oscar- and seven BAFTA-winning blockbuster opens as Jamal Malik (Dev Patel), a chaiwalah at a call centre, is on the verge of winning 20 million rupees on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? . But the host of the show, Prem Kumar (Anil Kapoor) is convinced he's cheating and hands him over to the police to beat the truth out of him. Jamal reveals that the right answer to each question has come from a significant part of his life, from when he and his brother Salim were orphaned after their mother was killed in religious violence. As he continues his story, Jamal reveals how he knows each answer; how he fell in love with Latika, an orphaned girl from whom he was later separated; and how his brother Salim took the path of violence as a gangster's gunman. But as Jamal is returned to the studio for the last question, Salim finally repays his brother's trust. As well as the outstanding Patel, Jamal is played in different stages of his life by Tanay Hemant Gharu and Ayush Mahesh Khedekar; Salim is played by Madhur Mittal, Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala and Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail; Latika is played by Frieda Pinto, Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar and Rubina Ali, all of whom turn in stunning performances.

    <desc lang="en">(2008) Danny Boyle's eight Oscar- and seven BAFTA-winning blockbuster opens as Jamal Malik (Dev Patel), a chaiwalah at a call centre, is on the verge of winning 20 million rupees on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? . But the host of the show, Prem Kumar (Anil Kapoor) is convinced he's cheating and hands him over to the police to beat the truth out of him. Jamal reveals that the right answer to each question has come from a significant part of his life, from when he and his brother Salim were orphaned after their mother was killed in religious violence. As he continues his story, Jamal reveals how he knows each answer; how he fell in love with Latika, an orphaned girl from whom he was later separated; and how his brother Salim took the path of violence as a gangster's gunman. But as Jamal is returned to the studio for the last question, Salim finally repays his brother's trust. As well as the outstanding Patel, Jamal is played in different stages of his life by Tanay Hemant Gharu and Ayush Mahesh Khedekar; Salim is played by Madhur Mittal, Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala and Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail; Latika is played by Frieda Pinto, Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar and Rubina Ali, all of whom turn in stunning performances.

    <title lang="en">A Serious Man</title>
    <desc lang="en">Filmmaking duo Joel and Ethan Coen write, produce, and direct this period black comedy set in 1967 concerning a Midwestern physics professor whose staid and stable life slowly begins to unravel after his wife announces that she's leaving him. As if the failure of his longtime marriage wasn't enough for Larry Gopnik (Tony-nominated Michael Stuhlbarg) to contend with, now his socially inept brother refuses to move out of the house as well. Larry is a modest man of science. Up to this point, his life has been uneventful at best, but things are about to get interesting. When his wife, Judith, announces that she is leaving him to move in with his smug colleague Sy Ableman, Larry does his best to contend with his failed marriage while barely tolerating his unemployable brother, Arthur, who appears to have grown roots on Larry's couch. Meanwhile, Larry's son, Danny, is getting into trouble at Hebrew school, and his daughter, Sarah, is stealthily snatching money from his wallet so she can afford a nose job. As Judith and Sy merrily begin making plans for their new life of domestic bliss together, Larry begins receiving a series of anonymous letters from someone who seems intent on sabotaging his chance for tenure at the university. To further complicate matters, a graduate student with failing grades is attempting to bribe the professor while simultaneously threatening him with a defamation lawsuit. Larry is in some serious need of equilibrium, though it's hard to focus on getting your life in order when your beautiful neighbor insists on sunbathing in the nude just outside your window. Perhaps by seeking the advice of three trusted rabbis, Larry can finally learn to cope with his afflictions and become a genuine mensch. A Serious Man is the second in a two-picture deal that the siblings made with Focus Features and Working Title. The first film in the deal, entitled Burn After Reading and starring Brad Pitt, George Clooney, and Frances McDormand, was released nationwide in September 2008(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Number 23</title>
    <desc lang="en">Jim Carrey and Virginia Madsen star in this dark psychological thriller from director Joel Schumacher. Walter Sparrow is leading a contented life until his wife Agatha innocently gives him a battered old paperback as a gift. As he reads, Sparrow is astonished by the parallels between his life and that of the novel's protagonist, Fingerling. But as the plot progresses it grows darker, featuring themes of transgressive sex, suicide and murder. It also hinges around Fingerling's obsession with the number 23 - a prime number that seems to pop up everywhere in the universe once you start to notice it. It's not long before 23 takes a similar hold on Sparrow. And, when he begins unjustly to view Agatha in the same distrustful light that Fingerling views his own spouse Fabrizia, it seems as if Sparrow has locked on to the same tragic trajectory as the story's lead character. Or can he find a way to wrench himself from the novel's grip?(n)</desc>

While all three are successful in their careers -- Kate has been named headmistress of an upscale private school, Molly is a doctor, and Janine's a police detective -- they've been striking out in the dating scene, and they get together on a regular basis to compare notes and drown their sorrows in cocktails and chocolate. One day, while attending the funeral of a colleague, Kate makes the acquaintance of Jed (Kenny Doughty), a good-looking man who remembers Kate as one of his teachers when he attended the school years ago. Despite the decade-and-a-half gap in their ages, there's a strong mutual attraction between Kate and Jed, and before the day is over the two are enjoying an affair. Molly and Janine are at once amused and appalled at Kate for dating a younger man, and while she tells them it's a short-lived fling that means little to either party, neither Kate nor Jed wants to walk away from their relationship; before long Kate and Jed decide they've fallen in love and plan to get married. The harder Molly and Janine try to convince Kate that she's making a mistake, the more Kate is determined to tie the knot with Jed, and eventually Molly and Janine decide to take drastic measures -- Molly hatches a plan to seduce Jed, while Janine captures their tryst on videotape(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A woman edging into middle age finally finds the love of a lifetime; too bad she can't convince her best friends it's for real in this lively romantic comedy. Kate (Andie MacDowell), Molly (Anna Chancellor), and Janine (Imelda Staunton) are three close friends in their early forties who have been sharing a long run of bad luck in the field of romance. While all three are successful in their careers -- Kate has been named headmistress of an upscale private school, Molly is a doctor, and Janine's a police detective -- they've been striking out in the dating scene, and they get together on a regular basis to compare notes and drown their sorrows in cocktails and chocolate. One day, while attending the funeral of a colleague, Kate makes the acquaintance of Jed (Kenny Doughty), a good-looking man who remembers Kate as one of his teachers when he attended the school years ago. Despite the decade-and-a-half gap in their ages, there's a strong mutual attraction between Kate and Jed, and before the day is over the two are enjoying an affair. Molly and Janine are at once amused and appalled at Kate for dating a younger man, and while she tells them it's a short-lived fling that means little to either party, neither Kate nor Jed wants to walk away from their relationship; before long Kate and Jed decide they've fallen in love and plan to get married. The harder Molly and Janine try to convince Kate that she's making a mistake, the more Kate is determined to tie the knot with Jed, and eventually Molly and Janine decide to take drastic measures -- Molly hatches a plan to seduce Jed, while Janine captures their tryst on videotape(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The air ambulance is dispatched to collect Frances, an 80-year-old woman who fell three metres into her empty swimming pool while gardening, and has sustained a head wound that could have resulted in a life-altering bleed on the brain. Ruth, aged 86, arrives at St George's A&amp;E with her heart beating three times faster than the normal rate. Doctors are concerned it may not be pumping enough blood around her body, and quickly prescribe fast-acting medication.

    <desc lang="en">Ubiquitous MTV emcee/vee-jay/interviewer Carson Daly came to "mainstream" TV as host of this nightly NBC half-hour chatfest, which aired just after Late Night With Conan O'Brien in the 12:35 a.m. time slot previously occupied by Later With Bob Costas. Taped on the network's Saturday Night Live set in New York, the series did its best to eschew the usual couch-and-desk talk show format; with no monologue and no sketches, Daly simply sat down and talked to his guests, who returned the compliment by avoiding the standard relentless plugging of their latest movie, CD, or TV special. Last Call With Carson Daly was supposed to premiere on Monday, January 7, 2002, but a last-minute contract dispute between MTV and NBC forced the latter network to sheepishly issue an apology and move the debut episode to Tuesday, January 8(n)</desc>

One potential partner to steer well clear of, however, is the praying mantis, the female of which is notorious for eating the male just after - or even during - mating.

Before Jim and Kelly set out on their mission, however, they first visit Willow Creek -- a town that thrives on the Bigfoot phenomenon -- to interview the locals about the legend. There, the couple are repeatedly warned that the forest can be a dangerous place at night -- warnings that go unheeded by Jim as he single-mindedly focuses on making the journey he's dreamt about for years. Later, in the darkened woods, however, the once-carefree couple experience paralyzing fear when someone -- or something -- begins rooting around their campsite, and uttering inhuman howls. Uncertain if they've actually survived an encounter with Bigfoot or simply fallen victim to a cruel prank by the locals, Jim and Kelly agree to pack their bags, and return to civilization at sunrise. But this is just the beginning of a nightmare that neither of them may ever awaken from(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Prolific playwright Tyler Perry adapts his popular stage play of the same name in this family-oriented comedy concerning a desperate mother who connects with the family she never knew. Brenda is a single Chicago mother of three who has been struggling for years to keep her kids off of the streets. Suddenly let go from her job with no warning to speak of, the eternally optimistic mother begins to experience a suffocating sense of hopelessness for the very first time in her life. When Brenda receives a death notice claiming that the father she has never met has passed away, she quickly gathers up the kids and sets out for Georgia to attend the funeral. Upon arriving in the Deep South, the once fretful mother is pleasantly surprised to discover that there is a whole side of the family she never knew existed. A crass but good-natured clan that welcomes Brenda and her children with open arms, the Browns' lazy summer afternoons and frequent trips to the county fair offer a much-needed contrast to the stress of surviving in inner city Chicago. Writer/director/actor Perry reprises his role as indomitable, law-breaking grandmother Madea in a comedy that proves sometimes second chances come when you least expect it(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Mighty Joe Young</title>
    <desc lang="en">Ron Underwood's remake of the 1949 cult classic stars Charlize Theron as Jill Young, who runs a game reserve in Africa that is home to Mighty Joe Young, a paranormally large gorilla. But both of them are in danger from big game hunter Strasser, who was also responsible for orphaning Jill and Joe. When Gregg O'Hara, a Californian zoologist, offers them both a haven in his reserve in America, Jill accepts but Strasser won't be thwarted and pursues Joe. And when Joe escapes and starts running amok in Hollywood, it seems the hunter's moment may have come... Since the film is produced by Disney, it is heart-warming throughout, but fans of special effects will enjoy the realisation of Joe, the work of expert Rick Baker, who also worked on King Kong (1976) and Gorillas in the Mist(n)</desc>

But as production on Le Mans got underway, the driven star would be forced to contend not only with the sudden departure of the film's original director, John Sturgis, but his own failing marriage, the threat of bankruptcy, and the fear of learning that he had been targeted for death by one of the most notorious serial killers of the 20th Century as well(n)</desc>

On an odyssey to bring the text to a sacred place, Eli brings God's wrath down on the robbers, murderers and rapists who lie in wait along the highways. Driven by faith and divine calling, Eli's endeavour becomes harder when he meets the power-hungry Carnegie, who tutors an army of psychopathic rogues and gunmen in a small town. Hoping to steal the book he believes is his last chance to rule what is left of humanity, Carnegie sets out to catch Eli, while Carnegie's step-daughter also follows Eli on his quest. As Carnegie and his henchmen hunt Eli down, they soon discover what a powerful and fearsome adversary he really is(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Shawshank Redemption</title>
    <desc lang="en">Based on a story by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption is the directorial debut of screenwriter Frank Darabont. In 1946, a banker named Andy Dufresne is convicted of a double murder, even though he stubbornly proclaims his innocence. He's sentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine, where another lifer, Ellis "Red" Redding, picks him as the new recruit most likely to crack under the pressure. The ugly realities of prison life are quickly introduced to Andy: a corrupt warden,sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley, and inmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or beatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the hope of the truly innocent, which allow him to prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with the warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal business schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the prison staff. In exchange, he is able to improve the prison library and bring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates, including Red. Starring Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins, Bob Gunton(n)</desc>

Drifting into downtown Buffalo, Billy kidnaps teen Layla (Christina Ricci) and has her pose as his loving wife when he visits his parents (Ben Gazzara and Anjelica Huston). Layla praises him and goes along with his fanciful tale that they met at CIA headquarters, where they both worked. Mom and dad not only fall for this, they are entranced by Layla, who soon begins to embellish her act. When she claims to be pregnant by Billy, he hustles her out to a bowling alley and on to a restaurant, where they run into trampy Wendy (Rosanna Arquette), who might be Billy's former girlfriend. Eventually, Billy seems ready to track down and kill the person he feels was responsible for his five years in the slammer. Shown at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival(n)</desc>

The only hope lies in a crack team of scientists (led by Aaron Eckhart and including Stanley Tucci, Hilary Swank and Delroy Lindo) burrowing to the core and re-starting Earth's engine. But is the disaster natural or is there a more sinister explanation? Jon Amiel's science-fiction blockbuster eschews outer space for inner-space in this taut special-effects extravaganza.

Recognizing the opportunity to gain influence in the aftermath of the public gaffe, a pair of scheming CEOs handpick credulous tourism-center director Marty Huggins (Galifianakis) as Brady's political rival, quickly shaping him into a viable candidate with the help of a seasoned campaign manager. As Election Day draws near, Brady and Huggins cast ethics aside to engage in the brand of hysterical mud-slinging that's sent contemporary politics straight down the toilet.

    <title lang="en">Django Unchained</title>
    <desc lang="en">A former slave and a German bounty hunter become unlikely allies in the battle against a tyrannical plantation owner in this western from visionary director Quentin Tarantino. Two years before the Civil War pits brother-against-brother, German-born fugitive hunter Dr. King Schultz (Academy Award-winner Christoph Waltz) arrives in America determined to capture the outlaw Brittle brothers dead or alive. In the midst of his search, Dr. Schultz crosses paths with Django (Academy Award-winner Jamie Foxx), a freed slave and skilled tracker who seeks to rescue his beloved wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from ruthless plantation owner Calvin Candie (Academy Award-nominee Leonardo DiCaprio). Once Django has aided Dr. Schultz in coralling the Brittle brothers, the two team up to capture some of the most wanted men in the South. Meanwhile, Django never loses sight of his mission to free Broomhilda from the treacherous slave trade before it's too late. Upon arriving at Candie's nefarious plantation, dubbed Candyland, Django and Dr. Schultz discover that slaves are being groomed for gladiator-like competitions by Candie's malevolent right-hand man Billy Crash (Walton Goggins), and together they skillfully work their way onto the compound for a closer look. But just as Django and his partner locate Broomhilda and plot a daring escape, Candie's house slave Stephen (Academy Award-nominee Samuel L. Jackson) catches wind of their plan, and informs his master of the betrayal. Now, as a clandestine organization attempts to back them into a corner, Django and Dr. Schultz will have to come out with pistols blazing if they ever hope to free Broomhilda from Candyland and the clutches of its vile proprietor(n)</desc>
