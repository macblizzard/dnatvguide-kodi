    <desc lang="en">(1999) M Night Shyamalan's chiller about a boy who has the not-entirely-welcome ability to directly contact the dead. Bruce Willis stars as child psychologist Dr Malcolm Crowe, who is asked to help Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), who claims he can 'see dead people'. Crowe is sceptical at first, but - prompted partly by a past case he felt he badly let down - he's gradually convinced that the boy is telling the truth. Crowe believes that actively engaging with the ghostly presences could help both Sear and the spirits to find peace. Overcoming his terror, the lad finds that communicating with the deceased does, at first, seem to be beneficial. But then matters take on their own momentum, leading to one of the director's trademark plot twists... Also starring Toni Collette. M,W,S,(n)</desc>

Taking over from the earlier series' host Regis Philbin was Meredith Vieira of The View. To make certain that the series would not be bankrupted after its first week on the air, the questions posed to contestants were considerably harder than those on the prime-time incarnation. Also, the famous "fastest finger" round was eliminated, taking some of the pressure off the contestants when they struggled to come up with answers. The most noteworthy change from the original version was the absence of Regis Philbin's familiar catchphrases: One would never hear Meredith Vieira chime in with the legendary "Is that your final answer?"

    <title lang="en">Who Wants to Be a Millionaire</title>
    <desc lang="en">Although the once-hot game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? had lost its luster as a prime-time ABC offering, the producers felt that there was enough life left in the property to warrant a Monday-through-Friday syndicated version. Taking over from the earlier series' host Regis Philbin was Meredith Vieira of The View. To make certain that the series would not be bankrupted after its first week on the air, the questions posed to contestants were considerably harder than those on the prime-time incarnation. Also, the famous "fastest finger" round was eliminated, taking some of the pressure off the contestants when they struggled to come up with answers. The most noteworthy change from the original version was the absence of Regis Philbin's familiar catchphrases: One would never hear Meredith Vieira chime in with the legendary "Is that your final answer?" The syndicated Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? was launched on September 16, 2002(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">(1999) M Night Shyamalan's chiller about a boy who has the not-entirely-welcome ability to directly contact the dead. Bruce Willis stars as child psychologist Dr Malcolm Crowe, who is asked to help Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), who claims he can 'see dead people'. Crowe is sceptical at first, but - prompted partly by a past case he felt he badly let down - he's gradually convinced that the boy is telling the truth. Crowe believes that actively engaging with the ghostly presences could help both Sear and the spirits to find peace. Overcoming his terror, the lad finds that communicating with the deceased does, at first, seem to be beneficial. But then matters take on their own momentum, leading to one of the director's trademark plot twists... Also starring Toni Collette. M,W,S,(n)</desc>

One team quickly speeds off into the darkening streets of London, confident they will be home for an early night, while their rivals struggle to get going when one candidate gets a little distracted. As the evening drags on, the teams battle with closing times and tired shop owners - not to mention negotiation problems and language barriers.

    <sub-title lang="en">Camberwell Grove.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The series charting the fortunes of London streets focuses on Camberwell Grove, which boasts some of the capital's finest Georgian architecture. Built as a middle-class retreat near the heart of the city in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, many of its properties became derelict during the Victorian era. The 1950s saw the return of a new generation of middle-class families - and now the street has been restored to its former glory. Residents including Janet and David Hephers, Shirley Andrews, Jim Tanner, Elpida Georgiou, Minnie Finkelstein, Joan Rose and Rushna Begum tell the story of this remarkable Southwark street and the people who have lived in and loved its houses.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Di learns her ruse to get pregnant has had a rather unpleasant side effect, and when her husband learns the truth, it becomes clear she has got a lot of explaining to do. Julie S begins the slow process of recovery after her mastectomy, while Fenner takes advantage of Tina's increasing isolation, and Yvonne's feelings for Colin grow. Snowball continues to yearn for death in the aftermath of Ritchie's suicide, sliding into a downward spiral of starvation and self-mutilation, despite Karen's best efforts to help her.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Thirteen</title>
    <desc lang="en">Prolific production designer and art director Catherine Hardwicke makes her directorial debut with the coming-of-age drama Thirteen. Los Angeles teenager and overachiever Tracy (Evan Rachel Wood) is an excellent student in her seventh grade class and gets along well with her mother, Melanie (Holly Hunter). She fears that she's not cool enough to be friends with Evie (Nikki Reed), the most popular girl in school. Fueled with genuine adolescent energy, Tracy follows Evie's lead into the harsh realities of sex, drugs, and hard-edged adventure. Consumed with temptations and conflicting desires, Tracy loses her good-girl identity, greatly affecting her relationship with her mom. Partly autobiographical, Thirteen was co-written by Hardwicke and actual 13-year-old Reed, who are close family friends. Originally intending to write a teen comedy, they ended up creating a hard-hitting drama exposing the contemporary teenage experience. Thirteen was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival, with Catherine Hardwicke taking home the Director's Award(n)</desc>

That condition is not surprising given the far-reaching amount of corruption in the system. Ex-police chief Daryl Gates remembers the King incident and the subsequent fall in popularity. Also recalled is the exposure of New York police corruption in all its forms. Frank Serpico investigated the toughest units and found a deep misuse of power.

Elsewhere, two cops discuss the severity of the penalty they must give a trucker who they have caught using his mobile phone at the wheel, and another PC faces a difficult choice when an arrested man begs to be granted the opportunity to say goodbye to his girlfriend and baby daughter before he's taken to jail. Plus, two officers in Yorkshire chase a man who managed to escape from them after being handcuffed. Narrated by Jamie Theakston.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Castle Ghosts of Scotland</title>
    <desc lang="en">Castle Ghosts of Scotland explores the eerie grounds of three of Scotland's most haunted castles: Glamis, Duntrune, and Fyvie. With a history every bit as bloody and treacherous as Shakespeare's +MacBeth, it's no wonder Scotland has so many ghosts. The childhood home of England's Queen Mother, Glamis Castle is reputed to be the most haunted castle in the United Kingdom -- despite resembling the Disney castle. In 1537, King James V accused the young and beautiful Lady Glamis of witchcraft. Burned at the stake, the ghost known as the "Grey Lady of Glamis" haunts the castle to this day. As the program travels to Aberdeenshire, Fyvie Castle's "Green Lady" ghost is revealed to be Dame Lillias Drummond, who was starved to death by her husband, Sir Alexander Seton. In 1615 during a feud between the McDonalds and the Campbells, a piper loyal to the McDonald clan had his fingers chopped off by the Campbells and bled to death. Current owners of the castle report strange knocking on doors, the sound of footsteps running -- and late at night, the soft strains of bagpipes being played in the tower(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">How Many People Can Live on Planet Earth?.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">David Attenborough investigates the consequences of human population growth - from 2.5 billion in 1950 to seven billion today - both on people and the environment. While most of this increase has come from developing countries, studies suggest western lifestyles take an unfair share of the planet's resources, as the naturalist argues that a change in the way we live and even smaller families might be needed if mankind is to survive on Earth.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">From the producers of The Rookie and Remember the Titans comes an inspirational sports drama detailing the true story of a down-on-his-luck football fan whose dreams of standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the best of the gridiron became a once-in-a-lifetime reality when he took part in an open tryout organized by Philadelphia Eagles coach Dick Vermeil. Vince Papale (Mark Wahlberg) was a 30-year-old substitute teacher and part-time bartender who had never even played college football. When Coach Vermeil (Greg Kinnear) made the unprecedented announcement that he would be holding open tryouts for the Philadelphia Eagles, Papale would go against incredible odds to live the dream and experience every fan's biggest fantasy. With a position on the Eagles secured and a new life path forged out of little more than determination and persistence, Papale takes to the field to experience the life-altering rush of running yards as a stadium full of cheering fans burst from their seats to support the hometown hero who proved it's never too late to take control of your own destiny(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Working Girl</title>
    <desc lang="en">Working Girl is a sparkling, entertaining comedy splendidly directed by Mike Nichols that takes a refreshing new slant on the familiar "ambitious secretary who makes good" story. Tess (Melanie Griffith) is a smart, resourceful woman who has trouble fitting in the corporate world. Smarter than her bosses and unwilling to trade sexual favors in order to advance, Tess is assigned to work for Katherine Parker (Sigourney Weaver). Tess quickly becomes indispensable to Katherine, and when Katherine breaks her leg in a skiing accident, Tess steps in and takes over. While doing some work for Katherine in her home, Tess discovers that Katherine has stolen an idea that Tess had shown her for a new proposal for an important client. Tess infuriated and discouraged by the betrayal pretends to be Katherine and, aided by Jack Trainer (Harrison Ford) who doesn't know of her deception, sells the idea to the client. When Katherine returns she discovers what Tess has done and has her fired. Tess manages to prove that the ideas were stolen from her by Katherine and also win the love of Jack who, unknown to Tess, was also Katherine's fiance.Melanie Griffith gives a standout comic performance as Tess, who manages to succeed without sleeping with the boss. Smart, sexy and shrewd, Melanie Griffith proves herself to be an excellent actress with perfect comedic timing. Harrison Ford and Sigourney Weaver are also excellent and bring depth and intelligence to roles which could easily have become stereotypes.Mike Nichols again proves himself to be an expert director of comedy, getting outstanding performances from all of his cast and giving the story tension, excitement and humor. Griffith, Nichols and Weaver were all nominated for Academy awards, as was Joan Cusackwho shines in a hilarious, stand-out performance as Tess's best friend. While criticized by some as a "feel-good" movieWorking Girl stands as a fine, optimistic, touching comedy which shows that a woman can succeed by using her brains(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A surprise Hollywood hit, this film is based on the novel of the same name by Terry McMillan and centers on four well-to-do African-American women and their relationships with men and one another. All of them are "holding their breath" until the day they can feel comfortable in a committed relationship with a man. Robin (Lela Rochon) is the long-time mistress of Russell (Leon), who keeps reneging on his promise to leave his wife for her. She dumps him to find a man she can have to herself, but her dates with a reliable but unattractive business partner (Wendell Pierce) and a drug addict (Mykelti Williamson) send her back to Russell. Savannah (Whitney Houston) is a successful television producer who also believes that her married lover Kenneth (Dennis Haysbert) will leave his wife. Bernadine (Angela Bassett) is a wealthy woman who abandoned her own career to raise a family. Her husband is now leaving her to marry a white woman. Gloria (Loretta Devine) is a beauty salon owner and single mother raising a teenage son. After years alone, she falls in love with a new neighbor, Marvin (Gregory Hines).

    <title lang="en">Office Space</title>
    <desc lang="en">Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) is a computer programmer working for Initech in Houston. Every day, he and his friends Samir (Ajay Naidu) and Michael Bolton (David Herman as not THAT Michael Bolton), suffer endless indignities and humiliations in their soulless workspace from their soulless boss, Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole). For Peter, stuck in his cookie-cutter apartment with paper-thin walls and IKEA furniture, every day is worse than the one before it -- so every day is the worst of his life. To cap it off, Initech has hired a pair of "efficiency experts" to downsize the company. One Friday night, Peter's soon to be ex-girlfriend Anne (Alexandra Wentworth) forces him to go to an occupational hypnotherapist to relieve work stress. While Peter is under hypnosis, the therapist keels over and dies. As he never snaps out of his hypnotic state, Peter has a new outlook on life. If something annoys him, he just ignores it or walks away from it. He is completely relaxed and enjoying life for the first time in a long time. On Monday, Peter skips work and sleeps in. He gets up for lunch and drives down to a restaurant next to his office and asks the waitress he's had a crush on, Joanna (Jennifer Aniston), on a date. When Peter stops into the office to pick up his organizer, he's called in to talk to the efficiency experts. Relaxed and friendly, Peter charms them as he describes everything wrong with the office, including his boss. Even as Peter now appears at work only as the mood strikes him, the experts decide he's management material and give him a promotion even as they lay off the hardworking Samir and Michael. Peter then convinces his friends to exact revenge on Initech based upon an idea from Superman III. Not everything works out quite as planned. Office Space originated from writer/director Mike Judge's first animated short of the same name, created in 1991. The short was about Milton (reproduced in the film by Stephen Root), a damaged office drone whose complaints and threats about his sufferings go unheeded(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Working Girl</title>
    <desc lang="en">Working Girl is a sparkling, entertaining comedy splendidly directed by Mike Nichols that takes a refreshing new slant on the familiar "ambitious secretary who makes good" story. Tess (Melanie Griffith) is a smart, resourceful woman who has trouble fitting in the corporate world. Smarter than her bosses and unwilling to trade sexual favors in order to advance, Tess is assigned to work for Katherine Parker (Sigourney Weaver). Tess quickly becomes indispensable to Katherine, and when Katherine breaks her leg in a skiing accident, Tess steps in and takes over. While doing some work for Katherine in her home, Tess discovers that Katherine has stolen an idea that Tess had shown her for a new proposal for an important client. Tess infuriated and discouraged by the betrayal pretends to be Katherine and, aided by Jack Trainer (Harrison Ford) who doesn't know of her deception, sells the idea to the client. When Katherine returns she discovers what Tess has done and has her fired. Tess manages to prove that the ideas were stolen from her by Katherine and also win the love of Jack who, unknown to Tess, was also Katherine's fiance.Melanie Griffith gives a standout comic performance as Tess, who manages to succeed without sleeping with the boss. Smart, sexy and shrewd, Melanie Griffith proves herself to be an excellent actress with perfect comedic timing. Harrison Ford and Sigourney Weaver are also excellent and bring depth and intelligence to roles which could easily have become stereotypes.Mike Nichols again proves himself to be an expert director of comedy, getting outstanding performances from all of his cast and giving the story tension, excitement and humor. Griffith, Nichols and Weaver were all nominated for Academy awards, as was Joan Cusackwho shines in a hilarious, stand-out performance as Tess's best friend. While criticized by some as a "feel-good" movieWorking Girl stands as a fine, optimistic, touching comedy which shows that a woman can succeed by using her brains(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Undercover Brother</title>
    <desc lang="en">Undercover Brother began life as an animated series on the Internet. The satirical cartoon was created by novelist and screenwriter John Ridley (Three Kings) for the website /urbanentertainment.com. Ridley wrote the screenplay with Michael McCullers, co-writer of the Austin Powers sequels, and it was directed by Malcolm D. Lee (Spike Lee's cousin, and the writer/director of The Best Man). The film stars Eddie Griffin (of TV's Malcolm and Eddie) as Undercover Brother, he of the gold Cadillac convertible and huge Afro, who uses gadgets and disguises to steal from the rich and give to the poor. His activities are discovered by the B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D., a spy organization devoted to subverting The Man (Robert Trumbull) and his henchman, Mr. Feather (Chris Kattan), who use their power over the media to demean black people and destroy racial unity. The spy organization is run by The Chief (Chi McBride), who is constantly screaming at his subordinates. They include Sistah Girl (Aunjanue Ellis), a beautiful martial artist, Conspiracy Brother (Dave Chappelle), who sees white supremacist plots everywhere, and Smart Brother (Gary Anthony Williams, who provided the voice of Undercover Brother in the cartoon), who supplies the operatives with gadgets and information. When a popular black political figure, General Boutwell (Billy Dee Williams), calls a press conference, presumably to announce his presidential candidacy, and instead announces that he's opening a chain of fried chicken restaurants, the B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D. rightly suspects foul play, and recruits Undercover Brother to look into it. He goes undercover as an uptight buppie to work for The Man, but his cover is soon blown, and the seductive White She Devil (Denise Richards) is sent in to use her feminine wiles to destroy Undercover Brother(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Seth MacFarlane plays a hapless farmhand in the Old West who loses his girl when he ducks out of a fight, only to be taught how to shoot by the wife of an infamous gunfighter in this Media Rights Capitol Western comedy. The setting is Arizona, circa 1882. In the wake of talking his way out of a showdown in the streets of Old Stump, cowardly sheepherder Albert (MacFarlane) is unceremoniously dumped by his beloved girlfriend Louise (Amanda Seyfried). Meanwhile, on the outskirts of town, notorious outlaw Clinch (Liam Neeson) prepares for a big holdup, instructing his wife Anna (Charlize Theron) and sidekick Lewis (Evan Jones) to pose as a pair of sibling farmers in Old Stump and await his return. When Lewis starts a bar brawl, Albert instinctively gets Anna out of harm's way and a friendship begins to blossom. Later, Anna poses as Albert's girlfriend at a fair in order to make Louise jealous, but it all goes awry when Albert and Louise's new beau Foy (Neal Patrick Harris), the owner of the local "Moustachery," end up challenging one another to draw in front of the entire town. Now there's only one problem: Albert has never even so much as fired a gun. Fortunately, as the wife of a notorious outlaw, Anna knows her way around a pistol, and with just one week to go before the big showdown, she offers to give Albert a crash course in marksmanship. With the help of his sexy, straight-shooting teacher, Albert not only manages to hit a can or two, but to summon some inner courage as well. He'll need all he can get, too, because when Clinch gets word that his wife is being romanced by one of the locals, he rides into town with revenge on his mind and a loaded six-shooter on his hip(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Disney's The Kid</title>
    <desc lang="en">If you could talk to the child that you used to be, what advice would you give him? That question forms the basis of this comic fantasy. Forty-year-old Russ Duritz (Bruce Willis) is a wealthy and powerful "image consultant" who has made a career out of telling people how to present themselves. But while he's a success in business, he's a failure in life; he's vain, mean-spirited, and hasn't been able to hold onto a marriage (or even a pet dog). One day, Russ is startled to meet Rusty (Spencer Breslin), a stocky kid whom he soon realizes is himself at the age of eight, having passed through a wrinkle in time. Young Rusty doesn't seem much happier than the grown-up Russ, so the older man takes his younger self under his wing and tries to teach him how to avoid the mistakes he's made, while Rusty encourages Russ to be a more caring human being. Along the way, Russ and Rusty become friends, and realize how much they can learn from each other. Disney's The Kid also stars Jean Smart as one of Russ' clients, Lily Tomlin as his assistant, and Daniel Von Bargen as his father(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Rushmore</title>
    <desc lang="en">After the highly acclaimed independent film Bottle Rocket, director Wes Anderson followed up with a quirky Touchstone Studios film entitled Rushmore. Written by Anderson and friend Owen Wilson (an actor in Armageddon and Anaconda), they created the story of Max Fischer, a highly eccentric 15-year-old boy who attends the tenth grade at Rushmore Academy. Played by Jason Schwartzman (Talia Shire's son and Francis Ford Coppola's nephew), Max is a poor student with big dreams and a love of extracurricular activities. Max is editor of the school newspaper and yearbook, president of the chess, astronomy, French, and German clubs, captain of the fencing team, and director of the school play. Max is also a compulsive liar, telling everyone that his barber father (Seymour Cassel) is really a brain surgeon. Suddenly Max falls in love with Miss Cross (Olivia Williams), a first-grade teacher at the school. He also makes a new friend in business tycoon Mr. Blume (Bill Murray), an eccentric millionaire who also loves Miss Cross. The love triangle heats up as Max refuses to believe that his age has anything to do with Miss Cross refusing his romantic advances. Also Max's scheme to erect an aquarium on the school baseball diamond gets him booted out of Rushmore Academy. As his life crumbles around him, he is forced to grow up and accept the consequences of his actions and his lies. He throws himself more into his extracurricular activities, hoping to redeem himself by staging the most ambitious school play ever attempted(n)</desc>

The year is 2027, and women can no longer give birth. The youngest inhabitant of the planet has just died at the age of 18, and all hope for humanity has been lost. As civilization descends into chaos, a dying world finds one last chance for survival in the form of a woman who has become inexplicably pregnant. Now, as warring nationalistic sects clash and British leaders try to maintain their totalitarian stronghold on the country, a disillusioned bureaucrat (Clive Owen) is brought back into the fold of activism by his guerrilla ex-wife (Julianne Moore). Reluctantly, he takes on the daunting task of escorting Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey), the refugee who represents humankind's last hope for survival, out of harm's way and into the care of a mysterious organization known as The Human Project.

    <title lang="en">The Fence</title>
    <desc lang="en">In October 2006, the United States government authorized the construction of a massive fence stretching seven hundred miles along the border separating the U.S. and Mexico. Proponents of the fence claimed that it would help prevent illegal immigration into the United States and foil drug smuggling. However, three years into the construction project, undocumented aliens are still streaming into America through communities divided by the fence, and drug traffic has not been significantly reduced. The fence also runs through a number of Mexican communities, dividing small towns and school campuses thanks to poor planning, and the construction has had a negative effect on the environment of previously unspoiled territories. The fence is ugly, impractical and ineffective -- so why is America still spending billions on dollars on completing a project that's a failure? Filmmaker Rory Kennedy examines the strange history and sometimes comical consequences of the border project in the documentary The Fence; produced for the premium cable network HBO, The Fence received its world premiere at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Finding John Christmas</title>
    <desc lang="en">First telecast by CBS on November 30, 2003, the made-for-TV Finding John Christmas is a sequel to the previous year's A Town Without Christmas, with Peter Falk reprising his role as versatile guardian angel Max. Valerie Bertinelli plays Kathleen McAllister, a divorced small-town nurse whose depression over the fact that the hospital ER she maintains may be forced to shut down because of a $100,000 debt is briefly lifted when she spots a newspaper picture taken by photojournalist Noah Greeley (David Cubitt). The picture shows an act of bravery performed by Noah's firefighter brother Hank (William Russ), who mysteriously left town 25 years ago and hasn't been seen since. Hank would like to quietly slip back into town without explanation or fanfare, but this proves impossible when Noah's newspaper posts a $50,000 reward to identify Hank, known only to the public as "John Christmas." And there's something, very, very curious about that photo: It also shows a Santa Claus suit seemingly floating in midair without an occupant. That elusive "Santa" is of course the angelic Max, who pops up now and again throughout the story in a variety of guises to solve problems, dispense advice, tie up loose plot strands--and even share a musical duet with Kathleen's talented daughter Socorro (Jennifer Pisana)(n)</desc>

Hunting deer in the desert, he comes across a drugs exchange which has gone bloodily wrong, and among the detritus is a case containing $2m. He decides to appropriate the money, but it's not a wise move: he soon has the deadly assassin Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) on his trail, as well as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), and smiling bounty hunter Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson). As Moss tries to keep hold of the cash, and preserve both his own life and that of his wife Carla (Kelly Macdonald), a deadly game of cat-and-mouse is played out across the Tex-Mex border, as pursuers and the pursued try to gain the upper hand.

    <sub-title lang="en">England v Spain.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">England v Spain (Kick-off 8.00pm). Mark Pougatch presents coverage of the friendly at Wembley Stadium, as Gareth Southgate takes charge of the fourth and final game of his short stint as England manager. Southgate stepped up from his role as Under-21s boss to take the reins of the senior team in the wake of Sam Allardyce's shock departure after just one match, and has been seen by many as an ideal candidate for the job full-time. No decision has yet been taken by the FA, but the former Middlesbrough defender will be keen to impress his superiors with a good performance here against the former world champions. The most recent contest between these nations was also a friendly encounter, and took place one year and one day ago, and on that occasion it was Spain that emerged victorious. Second-half goals from Mario and Santi Cazorla were enough to give them a 2-0 win, which at the time was England's first defeat in 16 matches. With analysis from Ian Wright, Ryan Giggs, Lee Dixon and Aitor Karanka, and commentary by Clive Tyldesley and Glenn Hoddle.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">War Elephants</title>
    <desc lang="en">Join brother-and-sister-team Bob and Joyce Poole as they travel to Gorongosa National Park in Mozambique on a simple but dangerous (some would say crazy) mission: to confront traumatized, charging elephants; teach them not to attack people; and convince them that after 16 years of civil war, poaching and destruction, the humans in the park now come in peace and offer protection, not bloodshed and terror. But to get their message across, Bob and Joyce must put themselves in harm's way. Some say elephants never forget, and in Gorongosa National Park, they seem to remember the bullets that killed their family members and the terror that destroyed their culture. Elephant expert and scientist Joyce Poole has been studying these magnificent giants for over 30 years, while Bob, an acclaimed cinematographer, has been filming them for just as long. Their plan is a complex mixture of science and what some might consider insanity: Bob and Joyce will drive directly into the path of charging Gorongosa elephants - and refuse to back down. The hope is to habituate the elephants to people, prove that tourists are not a threat, and hopefully, not get trampled in the process. But when six tons of angry elephant comes charging straight at their vehicle, will Bob and Joyce be able to stay put, or will fear take over? If these elephants really cannot forget the past, the question becomes: Can they forgive?(n)</desc>

But their home is getting overrun with stock.(n)</desc>

But it isn't all fun and games as a Children in Need crisis looms when a gingerbread Pudsey Bear is found to contain dodgy E numbers, and in Stratford a suspected shoplifter tries to prove his innocence by stripping off inside the store.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">As their tour of duty in Iraq draws to a close, four American soldiers learn that they are scheduled to embark on one final, fateful mission that will forever change their concept of war. Shortly after receiving the news that they will soon be reunited with their families back in the United States, a unit serving in Iraq is deployed on a humanitarian mission to deliver medical supplies to a remote Iraqi village. Upon arriving in the village, the unit is viciously ambushed and many lives are lost. Now, as the surviving members of the battalion return home and attempt to readjust to civilian life, the physical injuries and psychological scars sustained during that tragic event continue to take a heavy emotional toll on the war-torn soldiers. Samuel L. Jackson, Jessica Biel, and rapper-turned-actor 50 Cent star in an affecting psychological war drama from Academy Award-winning director Irwin Winkler(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Lost in Translation</title>
    <desc lang="en">After making a striking directorial debut with her screen adaptation of The Virgin Suicides, Sofia Coppola offers a story of love and friendship blooming under unlikely circumstances in this comedy drama. Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is a well-known American actor whose career has gone into a tailspin; needing work, he takes a very large fee to appear in a commercial for Japanese whiskey to be shot in Tokyo. Feeling no small degree of culture shock in Japan, Bob spends most of his non-working hours at his hotel, where he meets Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) at the bar. Twentysomething Charlotte is married to John (Giovanni Ribisi), a successful photographer who is in Tokyo on an assignment, leaving her to while away her time while he works. Beyond their shared bemusement and confusion with the sights and sounds of contemporary Tokyo, Bob and Charlotte share a similar dissatisfaction with their lives; the spark has gone out of Bob's marriage, and he's become disillusioned with his career. Meanwhile, Charlotte is puzzled with how much John has changed in their two years of marriage, while she's been unable to launch a creative career of her own. Bob and Charlotte become fast friends, and as they explore Tokyo, they begin to wonder if their sudden friendship might be growing into something more(n)</desc>

Shortly after receiving the news that they will soon be reunited with their families back in the United States, a unit serving in Iraq is deployed on a humanitarian mission to deliver medical supplies to a remote Iraqi village. Upon arriving in the village, the unit is viciously ambushed and many lives are lost.

    <title lang="en">Zombie Honeymoon</title>
    <desc lang="en">A young bride says "until death do us part," but finds that doesn't necessarily put an end to her romance in this offbeat blend of horror, comedy, and romance. Danny (Graham Sibley) and Denise (Tracy Coogan) are a young couple who have just gotten married and head off to a beachside bungalow to celebrate their honeymoon. While enjoying a sunny afternoon on the beach, Danny and Denise's idyllic getaway takes a turn for the worse when a monster rises from the ocean and attacks Danny. The creature spews poison into Danny's mouth, and soon the new husband is dead. But Danny isn't gone for long -- he unexpectedly regains consciousness, but Denise soon learns that her new mate has become a flesh-eating zombie, and that the former vegetarian now has a taste for human beings. But Danny still has one link with the world of the living -- he loves Denise with all his heart, and struggles to keep his monstrous appetites under control for her sake, while Denise remains deeply in love with Danny, and tries to adjust to the strange and monstrous changes taking place in the man she married. Zombie Honeymoon was written and directed by Dave Gebroe, who was inspired to make the film by his sister, a horror film fan who lost her husband in a surfing accident not long after they were wed(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">(2006) Neil Burger's period mystery-romance starring Edward Norton, Jessica Biel and Paul Giamatti. In 1900s VIenna there's only one show in town - and that's the one featuring mesmeric entertainer Eisenheim (Norton). His magical abilities are wowing the crowds, with an act that ranges from mere tricks to an apparent capacity to raise the dead. However, he has also long been in love with Duchess Sophie von Teschen (Biel), which puts him in dangerous competition with the violent, scheming Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell). And, after Eisenheim uses one of his performances as an opportunity to humiliate the Crown Prince, Leopold jumps at the opportunity to have the magician arrested by Inspector Uhl (Giamatti) on grounds of necromancy. It's only then, during Eisenheim's interrogation, that we learn the full story of his life and the political plot upon which he's stumbled... M,W,S,HD(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Battle Royale</title>
    <desc lang="en">In a future where society is on the verge of collapse, the government takes drastic action against the problem of rebellious teenagers in this violent sci-fi opus from Japan. In the year 2002, Japan's economy has taken a dramatic turn for the worse, and massive unemployment and inflation have thrown most adults into a state of chaos; the nation's youth culture responds with unprecedented violence, delinquency, and truancy. Desperate to restore order, the Japanese parliament responds by creating the Millennial Reform School Act, in which groups of junior high students are selected at random, sent to an isolated island, and forced to play a rigorous war game, in which all but one of their number are killed. Kitano (Beat Takeshi) is an embittered school instructor who guides the 44 students of the Zentsuji Middle School's Class B through the deadly game known as "Battle Royale," as they struggle to survive against the elements and each other. Battle Royale proved to be both successful and highly controversial in Japan, where it set box-office records and prompted political leaders to call for stricter controls on violence in Japanese entertainment; the film was initially rated R-15 (no one under 15 admitted), unusual for violent films in Japan, though director Kinji Fukasaku later prepared a re-edited version that earned a more lenient classification(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Shadow Zone: The Undead Express</title>
    <desc lang="en">A horror semi-parody targeted at the young adult market that ravenously gobbles up horror books like R.L. Stine's Goosebumps series, this made-for-TV vampire tale stars Chauncey Leopardi as Zach, a teenage rebel with a flair for telling ghost stories, who stumbles on an underground cabal of vampires when he takes a fateful ride on a New York subway. The vampire's leader, Valentine (Ron Silver), proposes a deal to young Zach, offering him safe passage to the world above, thus enabling the trapped vampire -- who can only mingle with humanity through the willing assistance of an innocent youth -- to reach the surface as well. Our young hero balks at this idea and escapes to the surface with a wild story for his skeptical pals, who shun him until one of their number is kidnapped by the undead subway dwellers in exchange for Zach's cooperation. Though atmospherically photographed, this low-budget production is a bit too corny to provide either laughs or chills, and it suffers further from lethargic pacing(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Class and economics muddy the investigation of a homicide in this thriller from director Josh Sternfeld. When a child is found murdered in the small town of Hilliard, police detective Noah Cordin (Nick Stahl) is assigned to investigate the case. The victim's mother, Allison Connor (Laura Benanti), is a wealthy and well-connected member of the County Board of Commissioners, so Cordin is under pressure to find the killer as soon as possible, but working with rookie officer Leslie Spencer (Rachel Nichols), he isn't finding many substantial clues. One of the few pieces of evidence suggests the culprit may have been from the nearby town of Caswell. Cordin was born and raised in Caswell and knows its history well -- while Hilliard is a prosperous suburban community, Caswell is a working-class town fallen on hard times, and its survival is dependent on a proposed factory coming into town. As Cordin spends more and more time in Caswell, he becomes a target for the resentment the locals feel toward their wealthier neighbors, and a tense situation becomes potentially explosive when word begins to circulate that Connor may use her influence to keep the new employer out of Caswell unless someone comes forward to identity who killed her son.

    <title lang="en">Meskada</title>
    <desc lang="en">Class and economics muddy the investigation of a homicide in this thriller from director Josh Sternfeld. When a child is found murdered in the small town of Hilliard, police detective Noah Cordin (Nick Stahl) is assigned to investigate the case. The victim's mother, Allison Connor (Laura Benanti), is a wealthy and well-connected member of the County Board of Commissioners, so Cordin is under pressure to find the killer as soon as possible, but working with rookie officer Leslie Spencer (Rachel Nichols), he isn't finding many substantial clues. One of the few pieces of evidence suggests the culprit may have been from the nearby town of Caswell. Cordin was born and raised in Caswell and knows its history well -- while Hilliard is a prosperous suburban community, Caswell is a working-class town fallen on hard times, and its survival is dependent on a proposed factory coming into town. As Cordin spends more and more time in Caswell, he becomes a target for the resentment the locals feel toward their wealthier neighbors, and a tense situation becomes potentially explosive when word begins to circulate that Connor may use her influence to keep the new employer out of Caswell unless someone comes forward to identity who killed her son.

    <title lang="en">Meskada</title>
    <desc lang="en">Class and economics muddy the investigation of a homicide in this thriller from director Josh Sternfeld. When a child is found murdered in the small town of Hilliard, police detective Noah Cordin (Nick Stahl) is assigned to investigate the case. The victim's mother, Allison Connor (Laura Benanti), is a wealthy and well-connected member of the County Board of Commissioners, so Cordin is under pressure to find the killer as soon as possible, but working with rookie officer Leslie Spencer (Rachel Nichols), he isn't finding many substantial clues. One of the few pieces of evidence suggests the culprit may have been from the nearby town of Caswell. Cordin was born and raised in Caswell and knows its history well -- while Hilliard is a prosperous suburban community, Caswell is a working-class town fallen on hard times, and its survival is dependent on a proposed factory coming into town. As Cordin spends more and more time in Caswell, he becomes a target for the resentment the locals feel toward their wealthier neighbors, and a tense situation becomes potentially explosive when word begins to circulate that Connor may use her influence to keep the new employer out of Caswell unless someone comes forward to identity who killed her son. Meskada (named for the county that contains both Hilliard and Caswell) also stars Norman Reedus, Kellan Lutz, Jonathan Tucker, and Grace Gummer(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Gladiator</title>
    <desc lang="en">A man robbed of his name and his dignity strives to win them back, and gain the freedom of his people, in this epic historical drama from director Ridley Scott. In the year 180, the death of emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) throws the Roman Empire into chaos. Maximus (Russell Crowe) is one of the Roman army's most capable and trusted generals and a key advisor to the emperor. As Marcus' devious son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) ascends to the throne, Maximus is set to be executed. He escapes, but is captured by slave traders. Renamed Spaniard and forced to become a gladiator, Maximus must battle to the death with other men for the amusement of paying audiences. His battle skills serve him well, and he becomes one of the most famous and admired men to fight in the Colosseum. Determined to avenge himself against the man who took away his freedom and laid waste to his family, Maximus believes that he can use his fame and skill in the ring to avenge the loss of his family and former glory. As the gladiator begins to challenge his rule, Commodus decides to put his own fighting mettle to the test by squaring off with Maximus in a battle to the death. Gladiator also features Derek Jacobi, Connie Nielsen, Djimon Hounsou, and Oliver Reed, who died of a heart attack midway through production(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The true story of a middle-aged baseball rookie comes to the screen from Finding Forrester (2000) screenwriter Mike Rich and the studio behind the previous year's equally inspirational sports drama Remember the Titans (2001). Twelve years ago, the pro baseball aspirations of Texas pitcher Jim Morris (Dennis Quaid) were derailed by a severe shoulder injury. Jim became a high school science teacher and baseball coach, married his sweetheart, Lorri (Rachel Griffiths), and settled down to raise a family. After corrective surgery repairs, despite the longstanding damage to his shoulder, Jim discovers that he can pitch a ball even faster than he could before. When his team delivers a lackluster on-field performance in a losing game, coach and players agree to a wager: If they'll make it to the district championships, he'll try out for a major league ball club. When his team makes it to the championship and wins for the first time in the school's history, Jim is forced to live up to his end of the bargain. Nearly laughed off the field, he confounds the pro scouts by tossing successive fastballs that clock at nearly 100 miles per hour. It seems that Jim is about to live his dream of joining a major league team in middle age, when most players are planning their retirement.

    <desc lang="en">The true story of a middle-aged baseball rookie comes to the screen from Finding Forrester (2000) screenwriter Mike Rich and the studio behind the previous year's equally inspirational sports drama Remember the Titans (2001). Twelve years ago, the pro baseball aspirations of Texas pitcher Jim Morris (Dennis Quaid) were derailed by a severe shoulder injury. Jim became a high school science teacher and baseball coach, married his sweetheart, Lorri (Rachel Griffiths), and settled down to raise a family. After corrective surgery repairs, despite the longstanding damage to his shoulder, Jim discovers that he can pitch a ball even faster than he could before. When his team delivers a lackluster on-field performance in a losing game, coach and players agree to a wager: If they'll make it to the district championships, he'll try out for a major league ball club. When his team makes it to the championship and wins for the first time in the school's history, Jim is forced to live up to his end of the bargain. Nearly laughed off the field, he confounds the pro scouts by tossing successive fastballs that clock at nearly 100 miles per hour. It seems that Jim is about to live his dream of joining a major league team in middle age, when most players are planning their retirement. The Rookie (2002) co-stars Brian Cox, Beth Grant, and Jay Hernandez(n)</desc>

Under normal circumstances Vincent's wife, Joyce (Julianna Margulies), would be the family rock, but lately she's been preoccupied with uncovering the identity of the hired help, a secret that only her husband knows(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Fill the Void</title>
    <desc lang="en">A family crisis puts a young woman in a difficult position in this drama from Israeli filmmaker Rama Burshtein. Esther (Renana Raz) is the daughter of an Orthodox Rabbi who follows her father's faith, and she and her husband Yochay (Yiftach Klein) are happy to soon be welcoming their first child into the world. Joy turns to sorrow when Esther dies in childbirth; Yochay is devastated, and despite their own heartache, her mother Rivka (Irit Sheleg) and younger sister Shira (Hadas Yaron) step forward to help the widower look after his newborn son. Esther's father Rabbi Aharon (Chaim Sharir) counsels Yochay that it would be best for him and his young son if he remarried as soon as he feels capable, but finding a fit mother is no simple task. Rivka comes up with what she feels is a perfect solution -- an arranged marriage between Yochay and Shira, who has already grown fond of the baby. Yochay isn't sure he's comfortable with wedding his sister-in-law, and Shira feels no better about it, preferring to save herself for a virgin like herself, but the demands of her family may weigh more strongly than her own desires. Lemale et ha'chalal (aka Fill the Void) received its American premiere at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Actor Stanley Tucci made his directorial debut with a strong cast in this Depression Era farce focusing on two struggling two New York actors. In opening scenes, Maurice (Oliver Platt) and Arthur (Tucci) fabricate a fake fight at an outdoor cafe, do acting exercises, audition for a theater director (Woody Allen in an uncredited cameo), stage a pastry shop argument (to get food), and watch over-the-top, Barrymoresque actor Jeremy Burtom (Alfred Molina) on Broadway in Hamlet. Later, Burtom overhears himself insulted by a drunken Maurice and gives chase, forcing Arthur and Maurice to hide in a box. When they awaken, the box has been moved onto a luxury liner bound for France. To evade Burtom, they pose as stewards, meeting passengers and crew members: Staff director Meistrich (Campbell Scott) fancies head stewardess Lily (Lili Taylor), who goes for ship detective Marco (Matt McGrath). Others on board include Greek wrestling enthusiast Sparks (Billy Connelly); a former European queen (Isabella Rossellini); a suicidal lounge vocalist (Steve Buscemi); and a revolutionary (Tony Shalhoub) planning to bomb the liner.

Once word gets out among the lesbian community, Jack is inundated with requests, and is initially quite happy with his new direction in life. However, things -- as they are wont to do -- get complicated. There's his former employer, who is actively trying to pin the blame for their wrongdoings on his shoulders, for one thing, and it isn't long before the moral implications of his life as a sperm donor come to the forefront.

    <desc lang="en">A handful of inner-city kids move up to the big time in this teen-centric musical. Xavier Smith (Bow Wow), known to his friends as X, is a teenager growing up on the South Side of Chicago in the late '70s. X and his buddies are the hotshot skaters at the Palisades Gardens, a neighborhood roller rink where local kids roll to the latest disco sounds, but X loses his status as king of the hill when the Palisades closes down. With no skating action close by, X and his friends head uptown to the Sweetwater Roller Rink, where they feel like country mice in the big city among the expert skate dancers and beautiful women. But skating means a lot to X -- with his widower father, Curtis (Chi McBride) going through a bad patch, skating gives him a sense of accomplishment and a belief in his own talent. So X and company keep heading uptown to Sweetwater, where they prepare to take on Sweetness (Wesley Jonathan) and his crew of the rink's best dancers for the upcoming Roller Jam Skate-Off. X befriends a young local girl named Tori (Jurnee Smolett) and finds a good reason to go uptown when he meets a pretty skater girl, Naomi (Meagan Good). Meanwhile, Tori's mother, Vivian (Kellita Smith) takes an interest in Curtis. Featuring a score of classic '70s R&amp;B and disco, Roll Bounce was directed by Malcolm D.

    <desc lang="en">A distaff twist on Cyrano de Bergerac, Michael Lehmann's romantic comedy The Truth About Cats and Dogs stars the brilliant Janeane Garofalo as Abby Barnes, the lonely host of a daily pet-care radio show. When an enamored listener, photographer Brian (portrayed by Ben Chaplin), asks Abby on a date, her insecurities get the better of her and she describes herself as a six-foot-tall blonde, a description matching her ingenue neighbor Noelle (Uma Thurman). Ultimately, an unwitting Brian falls for Noelle's body but Abby's mind, a dilemma jeopardizing the future happiness of all three. Lehmann's direction is light and graceful, but The Truth About Cats and Dogs belongs primarily to screenwriter Audrey Wells and the superb cast. Garofalo's performance is a star-making comic turn, and Thurman, so often a remote and distant actress, is at her warmest and most engaging(n)</desc>

In the third year of the Civil War, Confederate officer Paradine (Gary Merrill) and his men march into a small town, where a regiment of Union Soldiers has been literally frozen in time.

Though he now possesses the means to win the war for the South, Paradine learns to his dismay that there's a diabolical "price tag" attached. First telecast November 24, 1961, "Still Valley" was the only half-hour Twilight Zone episode to be rebroadcast in the summer of 1963, by which time the series had expanded to an hour(n)</desc>

Paul (Rob Moran) and Aubrey Davison (Barbara Crampton) are about to celebrate their wedding anniversary, and they've invited their grown-up children out to the country to share in the revelry. The first to arrive are Crispian (A.J. Bowen) and his new girlfriend Erin (Sharni Vinson). It isn't long before the rest of the family has filed in as well, and the party gets under way. Later, at the dinner table, old sibling rivalries begin to resurface and parental preferences quickly become apparent. Just as tensions begin to flare up, however, a crossbow arrow blasts through the glass window and panic sets in. The family is under attack. But who are the savage invaders donning eerie farm-animal masks, and what is their motive behind slaughtering everyone in the house? No one is safe as the blood starts to flow, but Erin is determined to see the dawn, and she's got the survival skills to strike back at her attackers with deadly force(n)</desc>
