    <desc lang="en">Boat enthusiast James Strangeways invites Kevin McCloud to survey progress on the construction of his new home, which his architect nephew Ben Hebblethwaite has designed to be as `un-houselike' as possible. James has spent the past 35 years travelling the canals and waterways of Britain, and despite never liking houses, has decided now is the time to put down roots on dry land. Ben hoped a home standing on stilts above a marsh, and incorporating ship-like qualities such as a keel-shaped roof, will be enough to satisfy his boat-mad uncle. However, Ben's contractor goes into liquidation a few months into the project, taking £87,000 of the £300,000 budget, and when James decides to make a few tweaks to the design, alarm-bells begin to ring for the young architect.(n)</desc>

James has spent the past 35 years travelling the canals and waterways of Britain, and despite never liking houses, has decided now is the time to put down roots on dry land. Ben hoped a home standing on stilts above a marsh, and incorporating ship-like qualities such as a keel-shaped roof, will be enough to satisfy his boat-mad uncle. However, Ben's contractor goes into liquidation a few months into the project, taking £87,000 of the £300,000 budget, and when James decides to make a few tweaks to the design, alarm-bells begin to ring for the young architect.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Angelina Jolie, James McAvoy and Morgan Freeman star in this violent action adventure from Russian director Timur Bekmambetov. The life of office worker Wesley Gibson has been one of frustration, disappointment and anxiety; he has an overbearing boss, his girlfriend and his best friend are duplicitously having an affair, and he's on medication to calm his nerves. To top it all, he one day finds himself on the wrong end of an assassination attempt. Luckily, the agile, honed and lethal Fox is at hand to save his life. However, she also reveals that his recently deceased father was secretly a supremely skilled killer, and that it's her job to ensure that Wesley takes his place in the Fraternity, the mystical organisation overseen by Sloan, which exists to rid the world of evil-doers. And so begins Wesley's journey to unlock his hitherto unsuspected innate deadly abilities and use them for good. The cinematography echoes the inventiveness of Bekmambetov's earlier movies and takes a Matrix-like delight in playing with the tempo and camera angles of the fight scenes(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Based on a novel by Elleston Trevor, director John Moore's The Flight of the Phoenix is a remake of a 1965 film of the same name starring film icon James Stewart. The story revolves around the plight of Captain Frank Towns (Dennis Quaid), a pilot whose C-119 cargo plane full of oil workers could not withstand the violent winds of a desert sandstorm. Stranded in the harsh terrain of Mongolia's Gobi Desert (a departure from the original, in which the plane crashed in the Sahara), Frank and his navigator face an equal challenge in maintaining order among the survivors. The group of oilmen had planned on an uneventful trip to shut off a group of rigs falling below their productivity expectations -- not fending for their very lives. Before long, some men are revealed as cowards, while others exhibit a surprising show of strength, all the while hoping that the wreckage of the original plane can be salvaged before a Lord of the Flies situation occurs. Miranda Otto is featured in a supporting role, as well as Giovanni Ribisi and Tyrese Gibson(n)</desc>

Operating at high altitude and deep inside France, RAF planes were halting the bulk of Luftwaffe bombers before they could reach the beaches. The files also reveal that the famous Spitfire took flight for the first time during the mission, and the agile fighter was a spectacular success.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Shattered Glass</title>
    <desc lang="en">Before Jayson Blair made headlines for his plagiarized New York Times reporting, Stephen Glass defamed the weekly current events magazine The New Republic with a series of eye-catching, entertaining, and completely fabricated stories. Now Glass' trail of lies gets the big-screen treatment in writer/director Billy Ray's Shattered Glass, featuring Hayden Christensen in the title role. The film chronicles Glass' time at the magazine in the late '90s, when his colorful coverage of a hedonistic Young Republican convention, superstar web hackers, and the circus surrounding the Bill Clinton/Monica Lewinsky scandal made him the toast of the publishing world, garnering attention from such national publications as George and Rolling Stone. Barely out of college, the eager Glass ingratiates himself with the office staff, including his mentor, managing editor Michael Kelly (Hank Azaria). But when Kelly is unceremoniously fired and replaced with editor Chuck Lane (Peter Sarsgaard), Glass' pieces come under a greater degree of scrutiny, until one in particular threatens to expose his tall tales to the rest of the world. Based in part on a Vanity Fair article by journalist Buzz Bissinger, Shattered Glass premiered at the Telluride and Toronto film festivals before its limited fall theatrical release(n)</desc>

Conceived and produced by Paranormal Activity's Oren Peli, Chernobyl Diaries gets underway as six thrill-seeking tourists hire a fearless tour guide, and travel to the abandoned Ukrainian city of Pripyat. Back when the Chernobyl nuclear reactor was up and running, Pripyat was the place the workers called home. But 25 years after one of the worst power-plant accidents in history, the city serves as an eerily silent testament to the dangers of nuclear power. Later, after getting unexpectedly stranded in Pripyat, the tourists and their guide realize they are being hunted. Now the harder they try to flee, the faster their numbers dwindle until only a few are left standing. Only then will the unspeakable terror that stalks these deserted streets finally emerge from the shadows to launch one last relentless, terrifying attack(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Shattered Glass</title>
    <desc lang="en">Before Jayson Blair made headlines for his plagiarized New York Times reporting, Stephen Glass defamed the weekly current events magazine The New Republic with a series of eye-catching, entertaining, and completely fabricated stories. Now Glass' trail of lies gets the big-screen treatment in writer/director Billy Ray's Shattered Glass, featuring Hayden Christensen in the title role. The film chronicles Glass' time at the magazine in the late '90s, when his colorful coverage of a hedonistic Young Republican convention, superstar web hackers, and the circus surrounding the Bill Clinton/Monica Lewinsky scandal made him the toast of the publishing world, garnering attention from such national publications as George and Rolling Stone. Barely out of college, the eager Glass ingratiates himself with the office staff, including his mentor, managing editor Michael Kelly (Hank Azaria). But when Kelly is unceremoniously fired and replaced with editor Chuck Lane (Peter Sarsgaard), Glass' pieces come under a greater degree of scrutiny, until one in particular threatens to expose his tall tales to the rest of the world. Based in part on a Vanity Fair article by journalist Buzz Bissinger, Shattered Glass premiered at the Telluride and Toronto film festivals before its limited fall theatrical release(n)</desc>

Wealthy and well-connected, Tom Capano was still subjected to the torments of the heart. When an affair with Anne Marie Fahey ended badly, he snapped.

But, he held onto the claim that Fahey was killed by someone else. Capano was convicted and sentenced to death(n)</desc>

Wildlife cameraman Gordon Buchanan hopes to get closer to wild wolves than anyone before to discover the true nature of this feared predator and heads to the north of Canada in search of a pack that has never seen people and so has no fear of humans. He begins to gain the trust of an Arctic wolf family and as time passes becomes accepted by the pack, including a female and its three newborn pups, and has some close encounters that reveal a softer side to the animals.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">For Love of the Game</title>
    <desc lang="en">Based on the novel by Michael Shaara, For Love of the Game brought Kevin Costner back to the world of baseball after his successes with Bull Durham (1988) and Field of Dreams (1989). Billy Chapel (Kevin Costner) is a star pitcher with the Detroit Tigers, standing on the mound at Yankee Stadium and throwing what is shaping up to be a perfect game with the help of his best friend and catcher, Gus Osinski (John C. Reilly). However, Billy is having a hard time keeping his mind on the game; he's come to a crossroads in both his personal and professional lives, and he isn't sure what to do or where to go. He's learned that the Tigers are about to be sold, and the new owners intend to trade him at the end of the season, and that his girlfriend Jane (Kelly Preston) is planning to leave him. For Love of the Game represents a change of pace for director Sam Raimi, best-known for the Evil Dead trilogy and the acclaimed suspense drama A Simple Plan (1998) (although Raimi, a baseball fan born in Michigan, doubtless enjoyed making a film featuring the Detroit Tigers)(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back</title>
    <desc lang="en">The frequently recurring title characters, employed by writer and director Kevin Smith as supporting players in several of his films, are put to rest with this comedy that focuses on them exclusively. Jay (Jason Mews) and Silent Bob (Smith) are a pair of stoned New Jersey slackers who have long been used as the templates for a pair of popular comic book heroes, Bluntman and Chronic. When they learn that their alter egos are to be turned into a major motion picture without their consent or compensation, the pair sets off for Hollywood to sabotage the production. Along the way, they encounter an ape, a nun (Carrie Fisher), the cast of Scooby-Doo, a Charlie's Angels-style band of sexy women who use them as stool pigeons in a diamond heist, and an unhinged wildlife ranger (Will Ferrell). They also meet up with some regulars from the Smith canon, including Alyssa Jones (Joey Lauren Adams), Brian O'Halloran as Dante Hicks, Jason Lee as Banky Edwards, Alanis Morissette as God, and actors Ben Affleck and Matt Damon in dual roles as themselves and two other familiar characters. Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back co-stars numerous other recognizable performers in roles of various sizes, including Shannen Doherty, Jason Biggs, James Van Der Beek, Shannon Elizabeth, Tracy Morgan, Judd Nelson, Chris Rock, and George Carlin, among others(n)</desc>

Six months ago John married the new girl in town (Ariel), and people begin to suspect that Max might be missing something similar in his life. The only joy Max claims is left in his life is fishing, but that might change with the new owner of the bait shop(n)</desc>

At Christmastime, Monk (Tony Shalhoub) is reunited with his long-lost father Jack (Dan Hedaya), an itinerant truck driver--and as if this wasn't enough of a jolt to his senses, our hero discovers that he has a half-brother named Junior. In the spirit of bonding, Monk accompanies Jack, who has been hired to deliver free toys on behalf of his otherwise Scrooge-like boss, on a road trip throughout the American Southwest. It soon develops that Jack is palming off some very shoddy merchandise to a lot of extremely disappointed youngsters--and a subsequent murder proves beyond doubt that there are even more unsavory aspects to his current assignment(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Super Bowl XXXIV</title>
    <desc lang="en">This video details the unlikely meeting of the St. Louis Rams and the Tennessee Titans in Super Bowl XXXIV. The Rams, 1999's Cinderella story, overcame their last place finish in 1998 to meet up with the young and ambitious Titans in the closest and most exciting Super Bowl in over a decade. The video pays special attention to Rams quarterback Kurt Warner and his climb from grocery stock boy in Iowa to Arena Football League lackey to Super Bowl MVP. The game footage and the comments from players and sports writers demonstrate the intensity and excitement generated as the game wore down to the last seconds, the outcome not determined until the final play. Super Bowl XXXIV also pays special tribute to long-time NFL coach Dick Vermeil and his last season as a head coach(n)</desc>

With unprecedented access inside prison walls, it discovers what it's like to live with the threat of the death chamber, as well as hearing from victims and their families, and the family of those on death row - some praying for execution, some hoping for a reprieve. Each episode focuses on a key aspect of the system - execution, trial and appeal. This film follows the trial of 26-year-old Guy Heinze Jr, with remarkable access to the jury members charged with reaching a verdict on allegations that Heinze beat his father and seven members of his family to death. As the trial progresses, there is legal manoeuvring while evidence about the brutal killings unfolds(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Inside the Green Berets</title>
    <desc lang="en">The troops at the heart of the harrowing special National Geographic: Inside the Green Berets are far from standard issue military men. As the U.S. soldiers assigned to a outpost in southern Afghanistan christened Firebase Cobra, and required to protect Afghani domestics from the brutal minions of the Taliban, these Berets walk a hair-thin line of risk between life and death, between sanctity and martyrdom. Following 9/11, the U.S. Pentagon restricted this region to the general press for reasons of security and safety, but made a brief, 48-hour exception for members of the National Geographic crew. During that precious span of time, the Taliban indeed struck; two American berets were killed, five others wounded, and members of the camera crew were severely injured as well. Inside the Green Berets presents the footage shot during that two day span, and thus creates an intense and uncompromising glimpse at the lives of the soldiers - the day-to-day risks they traverse, and the heroism they wield - in the said region(n)</desc>

With a diversity of life that rivals the rainforest, the ocean is one of the world's largest ecosystems, but relatively little is known about what lives in its great depths. Drain the Ocean draws on the latest scientific knowledge and uses CGI animation to remove the water, revealing a landscape of unimaginable scale - with underwater mountain ranges long enough to stretch round the world one and a half times - and with tens of thousands of mud volcanoes and other features that are more dynamic than anything found on land(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">David Attenborough's Conquest of the Skies</title>
    <sub-title lang="en">First to Fly.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The veteran naturalist examines the world of flight, travelling across the globe to chart the evolutionary story of those creatures who seemingly defy the rules of gravity by taking to the air. Initially focusing on insects, Attenborough meets a descendant of the dragonfly, before examining the Atlas beetle, which tends to restrict flight to times when it needs a mate or a fresh supply of food. More aesthetically pleasing is a group of beautiful tropical butterflies, followed by an in-depth study into the blow fly - the jet fighter of insects.(n)</desc>

One potential partner to steer well clear of, however, is the praying mantis, the female of which is notorious for eating the male just after - or even during - mating.

Size matters for the minuscule male orb spider, creepily sneaking up on its intended and trying to mate without her noticing, while there's no rest for the lothario-like butterfly, which has plenty of notches on its proverbial bedpost. However, the harvestman spider has no use for sex at all, and reproduces by cloning itself.(n)</desc>

And when they meet again by chance, she doesn't just blank him, she genuinely doesn't know him. Then Joel finds out the truth: using a new and highly experimental technology, she is having her memories of him erased from her brain. In revenge, he's determined to undergo the same process but, as dodgy scientist Dr Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) begins the procedure, Joel changes his mind.

    <title lang="en">Mystery, Alaska</title>
    <desc lang="en">In this comic drama about fame, sports, and small-town life, Mystery, Alaska is a small town in one of the least accessible parts of the coldest state in the union. It's a town where everyone knows each other and there isn't much to do. In places like this, small things tend to become very important, and in Mystery, the one thing that keeps everyone sane is hockey. Most of the men of Mystery are obsessive hockey fans, and a local hockey league has sprung up, with pools of neighborhood talent facing off on the ice every week. When a national sports magazine does a story on the hockey fans of Mystery, Alaska, someone at the National Hockey League gets an idea for a publicity stunt: send the New York Rangers to Mystery to play the local all-stars in a nationally televised game. Most of the locals are thrilled; the game will give the people of Mystery a chance to bask in the limelight and make their sleepy town a household word. On the other hand, in a small town where everyone knows everyone else's secrets, this event could cause everyone to start airing their dirty laundry in public, with the whole world watching. Mystery, Alaska was directed by Jay Roach, who enjoyed considerable success with the two Austin Powers films, and stars Russell Crowe as John Biebe, Mary McCormack as his wife Donna, Burt Reynolds as Judge Burns, and Lolita Davidovich as Mary Jane(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Tyler Perry's Diary of a Mad Black Woman</title>
    <desc lang="en">A woman has to learn how to love and trust men all over again in this comedy drama. Helen McCarter (Kimberly Elise) would seem to have it all -- she's been married for 18 years to Charles (Steve Harris), and over the course of their time together, he's become one of Atlanta's most successful attorneys. But despite wealth and prestige, things are not as they should be at the McCarter home, and on their anniversary, Charles drops a bombshell on Helen -- he's divorcing her for another woman. Escorted out of the house with nowhere to go, Helen moves in with her grandmother Madea (Tyler Perry), a sassy woman with no shortage of opinions and a gun that she's not afraid to use. As Madea helps Helen get back on her feet emotionally, the divorcée makes the acquaintance of Orlando (Shemar Moore), a handsome man who is obviously attracted to her. But after her experiences with Charles, Helen isn't sure if she's ready to trust a man again. Diary of a Mad Black Woman was adapted from the popular stage play by Tyler Perry, who also plays several roles in the film, most prominently Madea; it marked the first feature-film credit for successful music video director Darren R. Grant(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The One-Armed Man. The fourth episode of Twin Peaks' first season, "The One-Armed Man," was originally broadcast on May 3, 1990, and directed by Tim Hunter (River's Edge). Deputy Andy Brennan sketches Sarah Palmer's visions of Killer Bob, resembling the Bob in Agent Cooper's dream from episode two. Another of Cooper's visions appears at a nearby motel, where Deputy Hawk (Michael Horse) finds the One-Armed Man (Al Strobel). Ben Horne and Catherine are also at the same hotel, making plans to burn the mill, while Josie spies on them. Agent Cooper questions the One-Armed Man, who claims to be named Philip Michael Gerard, about his connection to BOB. At the Double R Diner, Norma Jennings (Peggy Lipton) gets word that her husband, Hank Jennings (Chris Mulkey), is up for parole, and he is granted release after she defends him in court. Audrey Horne begs her father for a job at his department store, where Laura Palmer once worked. She plans to conduct her own secret investigation with the additional help of Donna Hayward. Leo Johnson's bloody shirt is found in Jacques Renault's apartment, while Leo and Ben make plans concerning the mill. Later that evening, Donna and James Hurley look for the other half of the gold heart necklace that they had buried. This episode features the voice of series creator David Lynch as Cooper's hard-of-hearing supervisor, Gordon Cole(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Revolutionary Road</title>
    <desc lang="en">Drama based on Richard Yates's acclaimed novel, reuniting the Titanic stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. April and Frank Wheeler are a young, thriving couple living with their two children in a Connecticut suburb in the mid-1950s. Their self-assured exterior masks a creeping frustration at their inability to feel fulfilled in their relationships or careers. Frank is mired in a well-paying but boring office job, and April is a housewife still mourning the demise of her hoped-for acting career. Determined to identify themselves as superior to the mediocre sprawl of suburbanites who surround them, they decide to move to France where they will be better able to develop their true artistic sensibilities, free of the consumerist demands of capitalist America. But as their relationship deteriorates into an endless cycle of squabbling, jealousy and recriminations, their trip and their dreams of self-fulfilment are thrown into jeopardy.Dir: Sam Mendes.

    <title lang="en">Eddie Murphy: Raw</title>
    <desc lang="en">Filmed in front of a packed New York City crowd, the concert film Eddie Murphy: Raw presents the comedian (near the height of his popularity) performing his standup material. The energetic and often extremely raunchy set begins with a series of impressions, most involving some celebrity becoming upset at Murphy for unflattering jokes: a squeaky-voiced Michael Jackson threatens to pummel Murphy into the ground; an enraged Mr. T is confused by Murphy's verbal sleight of hand; and even paragon of calm Bill Cosby loses his cool while chastising the comic for his dirty mouth. After some digressions finding humor in racial differences and other matters, Murphy proceeds into the centerpiece of his act, a series of routines about contemporary relationships between men and women, including an extended bit about what life would be like were he to become married -- jokes that some have criticized as heavily misogynist. Finally, Murphy concludes his set with an extended, comedic but sympathetic, reminiscence about his childhood and family life, a tone that matches that of the film's prologue -- a fictional re-creation of Murphy, in his childhood, entertaining a family gathering with what turns out to be an inappropriately off-color joke(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Eddie Murphy: Raw</title>
    <desc lang="en">Filmed in front of a packed New York City crowd, the concert film Eddie Murphy: Raw presents the comedian (near the height of his popularity) performing his standup material. The energetic and often extremely raunchy set begins with a series of impressions, most involving some celebrity becoming upset at Murphy for unflattering jokes: a squeaky-voiced Michael Jackson threatens to pummel Murphy into the ground; an enraged Mr. T is confused by Murphy's verbal sleight of hand; and even paragon of calm Bill Cosby loses his cool while chastising the comic for his dirty mouth. After some digressions finding humor in racial differences and other matters, Murphy proceeds into the centerpiece of his act, a series of routines about contemporary relationships between men and women, including an extended bit about what life would be like were he to become married -- jokes that some have criticized as heavily misogynist. Finally, Murphy concludes his set with an extended, comedic but sympathetic, reminiscence about his childhood and family life, a tone that matches that of the film's prologue -- a fictional re-creation of Murphy, in his childhood, entertaining a family gathering with what turns out to be an inappropriately off-color joke(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Moulin Rouge</title>
    <desc lang="en">The third film from pop-music-obsessed director Baz Luhrmann tweaks the conventions of the musical genre by mixing a period romance with anachronistic dialogue and songs in the style of his previous Romeo+Juliet (1996). Ewan McGregor stars as Christian, who leaves behind his bourgeois father during the French belle époque of the late 1890s to seek his fortunes in the bohemian underworld of Montmartre, Paris. Christian meets the absinthe- and alcohol-addicted artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo), who introduces him to a world of sex, drugs, music, theater, and the scandalous dance known as the cancan, all at the Moulin Rouge, a decadent dance hall, brothel, and theater that's the brainchild of Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent). Christian also meets and falls into a tragically doomed romance with the courtesan Satine (Nicole Kidman), who becomes the star of the play he's writing, which parallels the couple's romance and utilizes rock music from a century later, including songs by Nirvana, Madonna, the Beatles, and Queen, among others. Loosely based on the opera +Orpheus in the Underworld, Moulin Rouge was shown in competition at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Sound and the Fury</title>
    <desc lang="en">James Franco directs this adaptation of William Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury, the writer's tale of the Compson family, a once wealthy Southern clan devolving into obscurity. Tim Blake Nelson portrays the patriarch, a boozy lawyer who oversees the lives of his children with cynical monologues delivered through an alcoholic haze. Quentin, the oldest child, goes to Harvard, but he's very close with Caddy, the only daughter in the family who has a child out of wedlock. Second son Jason attempts to rule the family with an iron fist, but he's full of resentment towards Caddy's bastard child. All of them attempt to care for the developmentally disabled Benjy (Franco). Franco employs a fractured approach to the narrative in an attempt to capture Faulkner's distinctive prose style. The Sound and the Fury screened at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">She's the One</title>
    <desc lang="en">Edward Burns wrote, directed and starred in this loose follow-up to The Brothers McMullen as Mickey, the eldest of the Fitzpatrick brothers. A cab driver, he picks up Hope and within 24 hours, they're married. His brother Francis isn't happy with the situation but he's trying to balance his life between wife Renee and girlfriend Heather. To complicate matters, Heather and Mickey were once engaged and she still has feelings for him. Partly a story of sibling rivalry, partly a story of men and women's different emotions and expectations, this is a smart movie that rises above the 'teen' genre thanks to snappy dialogue and the enthusiasm of the cast(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Training Day director Antoine Fuqua takes viewers on a dark ride through the streets of Brooklyn, following three New York Police officers as they wrestle with temptation, loyalty, and duty while attempting to uphold the law and deal with the pressures of the job. Eddie Dugan (Richard Gere) is days away from retirement, but he's been burnt-out for years. Unable to remember why he signed up for the job in the first place, all Eddie can think about is retreating to his fishing cabin in Connecticut, and forgetting the horrors that he's seen during his decades on the job. At the same time, undercover narcotics cop Clarence "Tango" Butler (Don Cheadle) is right in the thick of it. As hard as he tries to quit, however, his superiors always find a way of keeping him on the job. Much like Dugan, he's lost sight of his priorities, and these days Tango's loyalties seem to lie more with notorious inner-city drug dealer Caz (Wesley Snipes) than with the boys in blue. And Tango isn't the only cop who's being drawn to the dark side of the law; narcotics officer Sal Procida's (Ethan Hawke) wife is currently pregnant with twins, and he's barely making enough to keep his family afloat. When Sal learns that his wife is at risk of losing their unborn children, desperation drives him to consider unethical means of ensuring financial stability. In seven days, the lives of all three officers will converge at one crime scene as the NYPD attempts to clean up the BK projects, the epicenter of lawlessness in the highest-crime precinct(n)</desc>

The psychic special guest on a cornball reality television series exploring haunted houses, Heather (Carpenter) becomes convinced that a sprawling plantation is pulsing with supernatural activity. At first the producers laugh off Heather's outlandish claims, but when fleeting spirits are spotted and crewmembers go missing, it begins to seem as if the house itself is alive. Upon arriving on location, arrogant show host Quentin (Nemec) brushes off warnings of danger and rushes inside to rescue his colleagues. Upon entering, however, Quentin quickly realizes that the house is indeed haunted, and that his crew's only hope for conquering the evil therein to unlock the mysteries of the plantation's dark past(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Passersby. As the Civil War limps to a close, Confederate widow Lavinia Godwin (Joanne Linville) sits grimly on the porch of her ruined mansion, watching a seemingly endless parade of wounded soldiers drag themselves down the road in front of her property. One of the soldiers, a Southern sergeant (James Gregory) with a wooden leg, stops to rest, engaging the embittered Lavinia in conversation. As they talk, a sudden horrific realization hits them both -- a realization confirmed by the climactic appearance of "the last casualty of the Civil War." Originally telecast October 6, 1961, "The Passersby" was scripted by Rod Serling(n)</desc>

At the beginning, Solomon Kane is essentially a West Country bandit who cares little about the degree of violence employed in his pursuit of plunder. But he's given cause to reassess his chosen path while sacking a castle that, unbeknown to him, is allied to the Devil. Kane's men are slaughtered and a demonic creature tries to drag Kane's soul to Hell. Kane survives, but it's a Damascene moment: he repents and joins a monastery. Unfortunately, the monks don't want such a cursed soul in their midst and soon eject him. So Kane instead finds peace, happiness and worth with a hardworking Puritan family. But they too are attacked by the Devil's agents. Most of the family is killed and their daughter Meredith is abducted. So Kane dons his cape and capotain hat, picks up his guns and swords, and heads off on another bloody rampage. Only this time he's fighting for God and to rescue Meredith..(n)</desc>

But Lutze is in for quite a few horrible surprises when one of his former prisoners, the emaciated Becker (Joseph Schildkraut), shows up to see that justice is finally done.

And in keeping with the episode's title, Ross (David Schwimmer) and Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) go out on their first date -- and end up as an R-rated planetarium exhibit(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">An American ex-Mafia boss and his family are transplanted to France through the Witness Protection Program, but draw the attention of underworld figures who are determined to see them dead in this darkly humorous action comedy starring Robert De Niro, and directed by Luc Besson. Brooklyn kingpin Giovanni Manzoni (De Niro) had it all until the day he became a snitch. Now no matter how many times Agent Stansfield (Tommy Lee Jones) relocates Giovanni and his family, danger is never far behind. When they blow their cover once again, Giovanni, his wife Maggie (Michelle Pfeiffer), and their two kids Warren (John D'Leo) and Belle (Dianna Agron) are shipped off to a sleepy village in France. It seems like the perfect place to escape the long arm of the lawless until the criminally inclined family resorts to their treacherous old ways, once again becoming a blip on the syndicate radar. Now the thugs are moving in, and they mean business. As the Manzonis use their unique set of skills to survive the relentless storm of bullets, bombs, and rockets, the citizens of this peaceful French village suddenly find themselves in the middle of an all-out Mafia war zone(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Law Abiding Citizen</title>
    <desc lang="en">A brutal, gory revenge thriller starring Gerard Butler and directed by F Gary Gray. Could anything be worse than seeing your wife and child brutally killed in front of you? Well, probably not, but seeing one of their killers walk free after striking a bargain with the prosecuting lawer wouldn't make things any easier. And so it is for Clyde Shelton. But the experience doesn't destroy him; instead it eats away at him for a decade, until he snaps and takes sadistic revenge on the freed murderer. And then, even after he himself has been jailed, he embarks on a deadly campaign against everyone else connected with the case - including the police and legal representatives. Also starring Jamie Foxx, Leslie Bibb and Colm Meaney(n)</desc>
