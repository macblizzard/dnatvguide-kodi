    <desc lang="en">Guy Ritchie, best known for the tough-guy crime comedies Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, goes for a change of pace with this remake of Lina Wertmuller's 1974 comedy-drama, with his wife Madonna in tow. Amber Leighton (Madonna) is the wife of Dr. Anthony Leighton (Bruce Greenwood), the wealthy and successful head of a pharmaceutical company. While Amber seemingly leads a charmed life, it doesn't appear to make her very happy, and she often inflicts her typically foul mood on those around her, especially the hired help. Anthony decides to surprise Amber with a cruise from Italy to Greece, with four of their friends in tow, but Amber doesn't much care for the notion. Amber feels the yacht they've hired is far beneath her standards, and she makes Giuseppe (Adriano Giannini), the first mate of the crew, the primary target of her dissatisfaction. Giuseppe, an ardent leftist, feels nothing but contempt for Amber, but for the sake of his job he can't say a word in response to her attacks. One day, Amber declines an invitation to go diving with her friends, but later changes her mind, demanding that Giuseppe take her to the underwater caves. Giuseppe warns Amber that a storm is brewing, and his prediction proves to be right on the money; soon, Amber and Giuseppe are stranded on a desert island, and suddenly they discover the tables are turned. Giuseppe, a trained fisherman and outdoorsman, knows how to survive on the island, while Amber is utterly helpless, and he forces her to cower under his commands in order to survive; before long, their mutual antagonism has begun to turn into something approaching unfettered lust. Adriano Giannini, who plays Giuseppe, is the son of Giancarlo Giannini, who played the equivalent role in Wertmuller's original film(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">It was called "Disney's Folly." Who on earth would want to sit still for 90 minutes to watch an animated cartoon? And why pick a well-worn Grimm's Fairy Tale that every schoolkid knows? But Walt Disney seemed to thrive on projects which a lesser man might have written off as "stupid" or "impossible". Investing three years, $1,500,000, and the combined talents of 570 artists into Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Disney produced a film that was not only acknowledged a classic from the outset, but also earned 8,500,000 depression-era dollars in gross rentals. Bypassing early temptations to transform the heroine Snow White into a plump Betty Boop type or a woebegone ZaSu Pitts lookalike, the Disney staffers wisely made radical differentiations between the "straight" and "funny" characters in the story. Thus, Snow White and Prince Charming moved and were drawn realistically, while the Seven Dwarfs were rendered in the rounded, caricatured manner of Disney's short-subject characters. In this way, the serious elements of the story could be propelled forward in a believable enough manner to grab the adult viewers, while the dwarfs provided enough comic and musical hijinks to keep the kids happy. It is a tribute to the genius of the Disney formula that the dramatic and comic elements were strong enough to please both demographic groups. Like any showman, Disney knew the value of genuine horror in maintaining audience interest: accordingly, the Wicked Queen, whose jealousy of Snow White's beauty motivates the story, is a thoroughly fearsome creature even before she transforms herself into an ancient crone. Best of all, Snow White clicks in the three areas in which Disney had always proven superiority over his rivals: Solid story values (any sequence that threatened to slow down the plotline was ruthlessly jettisoned, no matter how much time and money had been spent), vivid etched characterizations (it would have been easier to have all the Dwarfs walk, talk and act alike: thank heaven that Disney never opted for "easy"), and instantly memorable songs (Frank Churchill, Leigh Harline, Paul J.

When Davis later became a star running back for the Syracuse Orangemen, his dreams were finally on the way to becoming a reality. Under the wing of coach Ben Schwartzwalder (Dennis Quaid), it seemed as if there is nothing that could stop Davis from entering into the annals of sports history; even during an era in which the civil rights movement was just gaining momentum, this fledgling gridiron giant never once doubted his ability to rise to the top.

    <title lang="en">Genesis: Together &amp; Apart</title>
    <desc lang="en">Many schoolboys get together to form a band, but few of them go on to become multi-million-selling recording artists - but that's what happened to Genesis. Its core members - Peter Gabriel, Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks - met at Charterhouse, a public school in Surrey, and began playing together with two other students in 1967. A few years and personnel changes later (including the addition of drummer Phil Collins) and the classic line-up was in place. But relationships within the band were fraught; Gabriel left for a solo career in 1975, and Rutherford, Collins, Banks and Steve Hackett carried on without him. Here, they're back together again to discuss their careers. Rare archive footage helps tell the story.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Alps Murders</title>
    <desc lang="en">A look behind the headlines of last year's shootings near Annecy in the French Alps, which claimed the lives of three members of a British family and French cyclist Sylvain Mollier. The investigation into the mysterious killings involved agencies from several countries, but with no obvious motives or suspects identified, conspiracy theories and speculation have seen the victims linked with religious extremism and espionage. The programme features interviews with a close friend of the al-Hillis and the hiker who found the crime scene.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In Washington, D.C., in the year 2054, murder has been eliminated. The future is seen and the guilty punished before the crime has ever been committed. From a nexus deep within the Justice Department's elite Precrime Unit, all the evidence to convict - from imagery alluding to the time, place and other details - is seen by Pre-Cogs, three psychic beings whose visions of murder have never been wrong. It is the nation's most advanced crime force, a perfect system. And no-one works harder for Precrime than its top man, Chief John Anderton. Destroyed by a tragic loss, Anderton has thrown all of his passion into a system that could potentially spare thousands of people from the tragedy he lived through. Six years later, the coming vote to take it national has only fuelled his conviction that Precrime works. Anderton has no reason to doubt it... until he becomes its #1 suspect(n)</desc>

Austin's wardrobe is most outrageous, his vocabulary is crowded by the cool slang of the day (Groovy, baby!), and he's irresistible to women, despite the fact that he can be charitably described as "stocky" and has teeth that strike fear into any practicing dentist. When his nemesis, the arch-enemy Dr. Evil (also played by Myers), has himself cryogenically frozen and sent into space, Powers also has himself put on ice so he can be thawed out when Dr. Evil returns. In 1997, Dr. Evil returns to Earth and is back to his old tricks, so Austin is thawed out and returned to active service - though he soon discovers his style doesn't play so well 30 years on!(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Mike Myers' phenomenally successful spy spoof gains a few more characters, a slew of celebrity cameos, and even more free-associative laughs in this third installment of the popular franchise. Austin Powers in Goldmember continues the exploits of the swinging-'60s leftover, who, as the film opens, is busy critiquing a big-budget Hollywood production of his life story, replete with a 20-million-dollar star in the lead role and a slew of John Woo-style action scenes. But not far from the soundstage lurks arch nemesis Dr. Evil (Myers), who has opened up a talent agency representing some of the industry's biggest stars -- all the while channeling their profits into a diabolical world-destruction plan with the unfortunate code name Preparation H. Dr. Evil presents a distraction to Austin by kidnapping his similarly swingin' father, Nigel Powers, and transporting him back in time to 1975. Travelling there to save his father -- and in turn win back his dad's sometimes-errant affection -- Austin comes across the alluring superspy Foxxy Cleopatra (Beyonce Knowles). The three of them travel back to the present day, where they join forces to battle Dr. Evil and his posse of nefarious evil-doers, including the trusty clone Mini-Me (Verne Troyer); his snotty son, Scott (Seth Green); the inimitable Fat Bastard (Myers); and the eponymous new addition to the fold: the epidermis-obsessed, precious-metal-fortified Dutchman called Goldmember (Myers)(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Dead Woman Walking: The Karla Faye Tucker Story. This documentary, part of the American Justice series from A&amp;E, examines the Texas death penalty case of Karla Faye Walker. Narrated by American Justice host and producer Bill Kurtis, this episode goes inside the investigation of the two murders that Walker and her boyfriend Daniel Ryan Garrett committed. The trial of Walker is shown through exclusive footage. After the conviction, American Justice follows her through her daily life, showing her prison surroundings and talking with her about her crimes. Sentenced to death, while Walker was waiting to be executed, she became a born-again Christian. Her lawyers used this transformation as leverage to try to get her death sentence reduced to life in prison. Their attempts were unsuccessful and Walker was killed by lethal injection in February 1998. American Justice also shows interviews with lawyers and law enforcement professionals who knew Walker(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">As Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) owns up to being Iron Man before the world press, Anton Vanko lies dying in Russia. Years ago, Anton worked with Tony's father to create a new source of energy. But greed got the best of Anton, and now as he slips away, his son, Ivan (Mickey Rourke), vows to make Tony pay for the sins of his father. Meanwhile, Tony fends off efforts from smarmy Senator Stern (Garry Shandling) and military weapons expert Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) to get him to divulge the secrets of his powerful Iron Man suit. The powers that be are concerned that Tony's technology may fall into the wrong hands -- fears that are soon confirmed when the cocky billionaire entrepreneur is confronted in front of the entire world by Ivan, who has built his own weapon using stolen Stark blueprints. Later, as Lt. Rhodes (Don Cheadle) wrestles with the decision to personally deliver Tony's suit to the military, Ivan finds an unlikely ally in the quest to destroy Iron Man; Stark Industries legal consultant Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson) reveals her connection to Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson); and Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) takes on some new responsibilities(n)</desc>

Peter Quill was just a young boy when, devastated by his mother's death, he sprinted out of the hospital and was swept into the stars by Yondu (Michael Rooker), the leader of an eclectic band of space scavengers known as The Ravagers. Twenty-six years later, Quill has adopted the nickname Star Lord (Chris Pratt). He's broken away from The Ravagers in an attempt to track down an ancient orb that is also coveted by the evil Ronan (Lee Pace), who is in league with the dreaded Thanos, and who dispatches his top assassin Gamora (Zoe Saldana) to retrieve it from Star Lord. In the process of doing so, Gamora also gets drawn into a fight with furry bounty hunter Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper) and his tree-like, humanoid companion Groot (voice of Vin Diesel). Subsequently thrown into prison, this unlikely quartet quickly makes the acquaintance of fearsome warrior Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista), who seeks bitter revenge for the slaughter of his entire family at the hands of Ronan. In the process of making a daring prison break, Star Lord, Gamora, Rocket, Groot, and Drax recover the orb, and transport it to The Collector (Benecio Del Toro), who reveals that it houses an Infinity Gem - one of six precious stones that harbors incredible powers that could pose a dire threat should they fall into the wrong hands. Later, Ronan acquires the Infinity Gem and plots to use its power to destroy The Nova Corps home-world of Xandar, The Guardians of the Galaxy must race through the stars to recover it before Ronan can carry out his genocidal plan(n)</desc>

The beautiful Queen Ravenna is an evil sorceress who seized the throne by killing the widowed King Magnus on their wedding night. Ravenna's astonishing looks are maintained solely at a terrible cost to the realm's maidens; and when she discovers the beating heart of her long-imprisoned stepdaughter Snow White will grant her eternal pulchritude, the princess's days are numbered. But Snow White is now a strong, capable young woman, and she flees to the near-impenetrable Dark Forest, where Ravenna's black arts are impotent. So the queen dispatches The Huntsman to bring Snow White to her fate. However, he switches allegiance and joins forces with Snow White, Prince William and eight dwarves to set out to end Ravenna's cruel reign.

Moe's best customer, Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta), decides to help out by showing how to make a new cocktail he's invented -- the Flaming Homer, a drink whose secret ingredient is Krusty's Non-Narkotik Kough Syrup for Kids. Moe gives the new drink a try, and it quickly becomes a favorite with customers -- but Moe has changed the name to the Flaming Moe. Soon, the Flaming Moe is the talk of the town, and Moe's Tavern is Springfield's number-one hot spot, but Homer is more than a bit irked that Moe is profiting from his handiwork; things become even more tense when a nationwide restaurant chain, Tipsy McStagger's, makes Moe a million-dollar offer for the rights and recipe to the Flaming Moe. "Flaming Moe's" also features a guest appearance by the legendary hard rock band Aerosmith, who provide their own voices; the episode first aired on November 21, 1991(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The four heat-winners enter the quarter-final, the Critic's Brief, in which they come up with two dishes based on the simple instructions of this week's guest judge - chef-turned-food critic Charles Campion. For the main, he asks for a classic British dish or a genuine Indian one, and for the dessert, insists on a pudding that the customer finds overwhelming. Once the food is ready, Charles faces each amateur in turn to give them his honest opinion, along with John Torode and Gregg Wallace. But which one will fail to make the knockout week?.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">John Torode and Gregg Wallace put five more keen cooks to the test in the fourth and final week of heats, and as usual they begin by serving up their Calling Card, a dish that showcases their talents. The judges' two favourites then sit it out while the others reinvent what they've just made, creating a new plate of food based on the main ingredient from the first round. After this cook-off, one of the amateurs is sent home, before the remaining four prepare dinner for a trio of former MasterChef champions and runners-up, after which Friday's first two quarter-finalists will be decided.(n)</desc>

Teen Tracy Turnblad's (Blonsky) regular cultural highlight is a local television music-and-dance programme called The Corny Collins Show. And, like all her friends, she dreams of having a chance to appear on it. However, this is Baltimore and it is 1962 - and Tracy's both overweight and, worse, has liberal attitudes to race relations, which don't sit comfortably with the segregationist views of the show's producer (Michelle Pfeiffer). But could Tracy's ambitions for not only appearing on the show, but also racially integrating it, receive a fillip when she meets the son of Motormouth Maybelle (Latifah), host of the monthly 'Negro Day' edition of the show? Also starring John Travolta (in drag and a fat-suit) as Tracy's mum, Christopher Walken as her dad, Amanda Bynes, James Marsden, Brittany Snow, Zac Efron and Elijah Kelley; plus cameos from the star of the original movie, Ricki Lake, and its director, John Waters(n)</desc>

Far, far away in a remote corner of the galaxy, the Nelsons are being watched by the paranoid emperor of a tiny planet named Spengo. Tod Spengo has taken a shine to Marge, particularly when she exercises to jazz music in her back yard. Spengo postpones his planned destruction of Earth by one day so that he can lift Marge to safety and then marry her, but what he hasn't counted on is the humans' determination to save their own planet. And, once on Spengo itself, Dick and Marge are in the perfect position to foil the emperor's attempts to annihilate the Earth(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Matthew McConaughey headlines director Jean-Marc Vallée's biographical drama centering on the story of Ron Woodroof, a Texas electrician who was diagnosed as HIV-positive in 1986, and who subsequently devoted his life to providing fellow HIV patients with non-FDA-approved drugs and supplements during an era when doctors were still struggling to understand the devastating disease. Defying his surprise death sentence, Woodroof set out to procure any and all non-toxic alternative HIV treatments available, and established a "buyers club" to provide the treatments to others afflicted with the disease. But that mission quickly made him a target for both the U.S. medical establishment and the pharmaceutical industry, both of which resented his defiance of government sanctions, and joined forces to shut down his operation by any means necessary(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Total Recall</title>
    <desc lang="en">In Paul Verhoeven's wild sci-fi action movie Total Recall, Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a 21st-century construction worker who discovers that his entire memory of the past derives from a memory chip implanted in his brain. Schwarzenegger learns that he's actually a secret agent who had become a threat to the government, so those in power planted the chip and invented a domestic lifestyle for him. Once he has realized his true identity, he travels to Mars to piece together the rest of his identity, as well as to find the man responsible for his implanted memory. Verhoeven has created a fast, furious action film with Total Recall, filled with impressive stunts and (literally) eye-popping visuals.

    <title lang="en">8 Mile</title>
    <desc lang="en">Controversial rap star Eminem makes his acting debut in this hard-edged urban drama, inspired in part by incidents from the musician's own life. Jimmy Smith (Eminem), known to his friends as Rabbit, is a young man trying to make his way out of the burned-out shell of inner-city Detroit. Rabbit's entire life has been a hard climb, and it certainly hasn't gotten any easier lately; Rabbit has just been dumped by his girlfriend, forcing him to move back in with his emotionally unstable mother, Stephanie (Kim Basinger), and he's getting along especially poorly with Stephanie's new boyfriend. Rabbit has a factory job that's tough, demeaning, and doesn't pay especially well, and he's convinced his skills as a rapper are his only real hope at a better life. Rabbit makes music with a crew of DJ's and MC's who call themselves Three One Third, among them his close friend Future (Mekhi Phifer), but his status as a white kid making music in a predominantly African-American community and culture is extremely intimidating, and after Rabbit freezes up in the midst of an MC battle, he's convinced he's missed his chance and that he's doomed to lead a marginal life as a factory rat for the rest of his days. With the help of his friends, and his new girlfriend Alex (Brittany Murphy), Rabbit struggles to work up the courage and the confidence to take one more shot at making his dream a reality. 8 Mile was shot on location in Detroit; the name refers to 8 Mile Road, a thoroughfare along the city's perimeter which effectively separates the middle-class suburban neighborhoods from the lower-class inner-city(n)</desc>

It starts in 2009, with an attack on two young school girls - in which the crocodile decapitates 11-year-old Rowena Ruiz. More attacks on fishermen and livestock follow until September 2011, when Filipino croc legend Ronnie Sumiller succeeds in catching the killer alive. Called Lolong, the beast that they pull from the swamp is more massive than anything they've ever seen. Crocodile biologist Adam Britton arrives to measure it and officially certifies it as the Guinness Book of Records' largest known crocodile in the world. But there is dissent among the villagers - they're certain Lolong is the wrong croc, and that an even bigger monster is still out there(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">New England.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">New series. The north-eastern region of the United States, known as New England, is the stage for one of the most incredible colour changes on the planet when the vivid greens of summer give way to the golds and reds of autumn. This film reveals how this vibrant fiesta is created by the battles between the trees and the forests inhabitants. Moose, chipmunks, rattlesnakes and a bizarre mixture of caterpillars all play a crucial role; but surprisingly the forest itself was made to be so colourful, thanks to a combination of hard work by beavers, ants and humans. Narrated by Domhnall Gleeson.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Nick Knowles comes to the aid of Liz and Jason Liversidge, a Hull couple in desperate need of help in future-proofing their family home. Not long after getting married and starting a family, Jason was diagnosed with both Fabrys disease, which causes a build-up of poisonous toxins in the body, and Motor Neurone Disease, which drastically reduced his life expectancy. The pair also discovered that Jason would have passed Fabrys disease on to his two daughters, which means that once her husband is gone, Liz will need all the help she can get in managing her children's condition. Nick joins forces with designer Oliver Heath and an army of volunteers to put together a home in which Jason can build meaningful memories with his girls, but one which also gives Liz the best chance of providing for their future needs.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">After months of hard work, Ashley Banjo is almost ready to present the UK's biggest street-dance performance. Having assembled five crews and recruited thousands of Stockton-on-Tees' finest, he tackles the tough task of making sure they all dance as one. But with just 10 days to master the final routine, it's a tall order, not helped by crew rivalries, an unexpected spot of rain and Ashley himself suffering a back injury. Last in the series.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Hurt Locker</title>
    <desc lang="en">Kathryn Bigelow's multiple-Oscar-winning film is a compelling fact-based, Iraq-set bomb disposal drama, scripted by journalist Mark Boal, drawing on his experiences while embedded with a United States Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal team in 2004. The focus is on the complex characters making up Bravo Company, who disable and destroy improvised explosive devices. The days are ticking down to the end of the bomb squad's tour, but their role puts the team in harm's way around the clock. And it doesn't help that one of the team is addicted to risk taking and pays scant attention to standard procedure, putting other lives in danger, as well as his own. The Hurt Locker provides a tense glimpse into the lives of these extraordinary men, and also probes the various psychologies of people whose job could kill them at any moment, as well as - briefly - exploring how they cope once away from their adrenaline-soaked vocation. Also starring Anthony Mackie, Ralph Fiennes, Guy Pearce, Brian Geraghty and Evangeline Lilly(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Orange County</title>
    <desc lang="en">Some cast and crew from NBC's highly acclaimed, little-seen series Freaks and Geeks reunite for this teen comedy that also marks the first starring role for Tom Hanks' son, Colin. The younger Hanks plays Shaun Brumder, a high schooler eager to propel himself out of the land of surf bums and ranch homes to which the film's title refers. He's had his sights set on Stanford ever since he read the works of professor Marcus Skinner (Kevin Kline), and his transcript is stellar enough to gain him admission. Shaun is understandably furious, then, when he receives a rejection letter in the mail; after some detective work on his part, he realizes that his flaky counselor (Lily Tomlin) mistakenly sent the university the wrong papers. It's up to him to get to Stanford within 24 hours to set the record straight -- literally -- and he enlists the help of his slacker brother Lance (Jack Black) to do so. Orange County co-stars Catharine O'Hara and John Lithgow as Shaun and Lance's slightly unhinged parents; the film was directed by Jake Kasdan and written by Mike White, both of whom contributed to several episodes of Freaks and Geeks(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Hurt Locker</title>
    <desc lang="en">Kathryn Bigelow's multiple-Oscar-winning film is a compelling fact-based, Iraq-set bomb disposal drama, scripted by journalist Mark Boal, drawing on his experiences while embedded with a United States Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal team in 2004. The focus is on the complex characters making up Bravo Company, who disable and destroy improvised explosive devices. The days are ticking down to the end of the bomb squad's tour, but their role puts the team in harm's way around the clock. And it doesn't help that one of the team is addicted to risk taking and pays scant attention to standard procedure, putting other lives in danger, as well as his own. The Hurt Locker provides a tense glimpse into the lives of these extraordinary men, and also probes the various psychologies of people whose job could kill them at any moment, as well as - briefly - exploring how they cope once away from their adrenaline-soaked vocation. Also starring Anthony Mackie, Ralph Fiennes, Guy Pearce, Brian Geraghty and Evangeline Lilly(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Orange County</title>
    <desc lang="en">Some cast and crew from NBC's highly acclaimed, little-seen series Freaks and Geeks reunite for this teen comedy that also marks the first starring role for Tom Hanks' son, Colin. The younger Hanks plays Shaun Brumder, a high schooler eager to propel himself out of the land of surf bums and ranch homes to which the film's title refers. He's had his sights set on Stanford ever since he read the works of professor Marcus Skinner (Kevin Kline), and his transcript is stellar enough to gain him admission. Shaun is understandably furious, then, when he receives a rejection letter in the mail; after some detective work on his part, he realizes that his flaky counselor (Lily Tomlin) mistakenly sent the university the wrong papers. It's up to him to get to Stanford within 24 hours to set the record straight -- literally -- and he enlists the help of his slacker brother Lance (Jack Black) to do so. Orange County co-stars Catharine O'Hara and John Lithgow as Shaun and Lance's slightly unhinged parents; the film was directed by Jake Kasdan and written by Mike White, both of whom contributed to several episodes of Freaks and Geeks(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Tyler Perry's Meet the Browns</title>
    <desc lang="en">Prolific playwright Tyler Perry adapts his popular stage play of the same name in this family-oriented comedy concerning a desperate mother who connects with the family she never knew. Brenda is a single Chicago mother of three who has been struggling for years to keep her kids off of the streets. Suddenly let go from her job with no warning to speak of, the eternally optimistic mother begins to experience a suffocating sense of hopelessness for the very first time in her life.

What he has is a tractor-mower that he decides to drive the 300 miles to Wisconsin. The film simply documents his painfully slow progress, the people he meets and the adventures he has but does so with loving care, slowly bringing out Alvin's character but showing along the way how he too brings out the best in those he meets.

    <desc lang="en">Diane Keaton directed and starred in this comedy/drama about a family brought together by potential tragedy. In her mid-40s, Eve (Meg Ryan) minds her house, runs a business organizing parties and events for others, and looks after her father (Walter Matthau), an alcoholic former writer who has grown argumentative and increasingly difficult to handle. Eve's sisters -- Georgia (Keaton), who is a few years older and the editor of a successful fashion magazine, and Maddy (Lisa Kudrow), a few years younger and a working actress with a spot on a soap opera -- have also had to deal with Dad, but only by long distance when he makes one of his frequent telephone calls. Dad now doesn't have long to live, and the siblings must pull together and make peace with their father and each other. Sisters Nora Ephron and Delia Ephron adapted the screenplay from Delia's novel; the supporting cast includes Adam Arkin, Cloris Leachman, and Mary Steenburgen(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Deliver Us From Eva</title>
    <desc lang="en">Three men discover that meddling in their sister-in-law's love life only makes their own lives more complicated in this romantic comedy. Eva Dandridge (Gabrielle Union) developed a sense of responsibility early on in life, when after the death of her parents she was left to care for her three younger sisters, Kareenah (Essence Atkins), Bethany (Robinne Lee), and Jacqui (Meagan Good). All four of the Dandridge sisters have grown up to be attractive, intelligent, and successful; Kareenah is happily married to Tim (Mel Jackson), while Bethany is engaged to Michael (Duane Martin), and Jacqui is going steady with Darrell (Dartanyan Edmonds). However, Eva still watches over her siblings like a hawk, and while her sisters love Eva dearly, Tim, Michael, and Darrell wish their sister-in-law would stay out of their business. The guys decide that if Eva had a boyfriend, she might be less interested in running other people's lives, and they turn to Ray (LL Cool J), a notorious ladies' man, for help. Ray is short on cash, so the guys make him a deal -- they'll give him 5,000 dollars to romance Eva, sweep her off her feet, and then dump her a few weeks later. Ray agrees, and while getting past her no-nonsense demeanor takes some doing, before long she's head over heels for him. However, Ray unexpectedly finds himself falling in love with Eva, and Eva, when offered a job in another town, decides to stay on to be with Ray. Even worse, the other Dandridge sisters are so impressed with the romantic Ray that they start demanding a bit more TLC from their own men(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Friday the 13th</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Marcus Nispel seems to have a bit of thing for remakes, having remoulded The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in 2003, as well as Conan the Barbarian this year. However, in this slasher horror, Nispel compresses elements of the first four films in the Friday the 13th franchise, which started way back in 1980, into one blood-sodden whole. This retread gives some background as to why Jason Voorhees became such a relentlessly homicidal maniac, before getting on with the business of steel on flesh and bucketloads of gore, delivering the movie's raison d'être. Some weeks after his sister goes missing, Clay Miller's search for his sibling leads him to Crystal Lake, a remote, wooded campsite. Also arriving at the spot is a group of young revellers, intent on partying. But it's not long before the man with the hockey mask and machete pays them a visit that any survivors are unlikely to forget. Can any of them escape Voorhees' latest murderous rampage? Or will they all vanish like Clay's sister and her friends?(n)</desc>

Wearing thick "age" makeup, Albert Salmi stars as ruthless millionaire Feathersmith, who would give anything to relive his carefree youth. Enter Miss Devlin (Julie Newmar) -- actually the Devil, but a very shapely Devil -- who offers to strike a deal with the decrepit tycoon. Curiously, Devlin doesn't want Feathersmith's soul (which he had already lost several years earlier), but she will settle for cold, hard cash. Another cautionary "Be Careful What You Wish For" yarn, "Of Late I Think of Cliffordville" originally aired April 11, 1963(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Friday the 13th</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Marcus Nispel seems to have a bit of thing for remakes, having remoulded The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in 2003, as well as Conan the Barbarian this year. However, in this slasher horror, Nispel compresses elements of the first four films in the Friday the 13th franchise, which started way back in 1980, into one blood-sodden whole. This retread gives some background as to why Jason Voorhees became such a relentlessly homicidal maniac, before getting on with the business of steel on flesh and bucketloads of gore, delivering the movie's raison d'être. Some weeks after his sister goes missing, Clay Miller's search for his sibling leads him to Crystal Lake, a remote, wooded campsite. Also arriving at the spot is a group of young revellers, intent on partying. But it's not long before the man with the hockey mask and machete pays them a visit that any survivors are unlikely to forget. Can any of them escape Voorhees' latest murderous rampage? Or will they all vanish like Clay's sister and her friends?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Finale. Ray Romano and his television family bring one of the most popular situation comedies of the 1990s and 2000s to a close with this final episode. "The Series Finale" says goodbye to the Barone family -- sportswriter Ray (Romano), his wife Debra (Patricia Heaton), his brother Robert (Brad Garrett), Robert's wife Amy (Monica Horan), and meddling parents Marie (Doris Roberts) and Frank (Peter Boyle) -- on a warm note consistent with the tone of this long-running series. Ray goes into the hospital for minor surgery on his adenoids, and Debra, Robert, Amy, and Frank get a scare when for a moment Ray doesn't come out from under the anesthetic. Moments later, Ray is fine, and the others decide not to share this news with Ray or Marie, but it soon becomes obvious Debra isn't very good at keeping a secret. The home video release of the Everybody Loves Raymond's final episode also includes the show's original pilot as a bonus(n)</desc>

Beyond these minor discrepancies, the episode serves up the standard hilarious recipe, as Debra (Patricia Heaton) complains to her sportwriter husband Ray (Ray Romano) about his family's habit of dropping in at their home unannounced. To mollify his wife, Ray arranges things so that his dad Frank (Peter Boyle), his mom Marie (Doris Roberts), and his policeman brother Robert (Brad Garrett) will NOT be in attendance at Debra's birthday party(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Die Hard 2</title>
    <desc lang="en">"Another basement, another elevator...how can the same thing happen to the same guy twice?" asks John McClane (Bruce Willis), in what is doubtless the key question of this film. A year after foiling the terrorist takeover of a high-rise office building in the first movie, McClane is waiting to pick up his wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), at Dulles International Airport just outside Washington, D.C., on Christmas Eve. Scheduled to arrive the same evening is Ramon Esperanza (Franco Nero), a South American political figure who is being brought to the United States to stand trial for his role in a drug-smuggling ring. However, a group of terrorists, led by renegade American military officer Col. Stuart (William Sadler), take control of the airport, scuttling radio transmissions and placing their own men in the control tower. Stuart and his men ensure that Esperanza's plane lands safely, and then demand that Stuart and his men be given a fully-fueled 747 and free passage wherever they choose to go. Otherwise, they will guide the many circling jets waiting for landing instructions into definite crash landings, killing the many passengers on board. Not willing to stand aside as terrorists once again threaten his wife's life, the wise-cracking McClane once again leaps into action to foil Stuart's plans and bring the passenger jets safely to the ground. William Atherton, John Amos, Dennis Franz, and John Leguizamo highlight the supporting cast(n)</desc>
