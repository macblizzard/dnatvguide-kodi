    <desc lang="en">H.G. Bissinger's best-selling true-life account of a few months in the life of a high-school football team comes to the screen in this adaptation written and directed by Peter Berg. Odessa, TX, is an oil town in the western part of the state that's home to the Permian High School Panthers, the football team with the best winning record in the state. Odessa is a town with more than its share of problems; the decline of the oil business in Texas has set the city's economy into a tailspin, and racial tensions still erupt into violence on occasion. But football is the one thing that brings all the people of Odessa together, and on Friday nights every fall, as many as 20,000 people fill Permian's football stadium to watch Coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton) and his boys try to lead the team to victory. As Gaines works to build a winning team in a town where victory is prized above all else, however, his players struggle through the emotional trials common to any teenager and ponder the fact that there is little future in their hometown...and that a championship season can be as much a burden as a triumph. Friday Night Lights also stars Lucas Black, Derek Luke, Jay Hernandez, and country singer-turned-actor Tim McGraw(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Punchy Cowpunchers</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Punchy Cowpunchers. Everybody is a comic in this Three Stooges picture. The killer Dillon clan are shooting up a Western town and Nell (Christine McIntyre) sends her handsome, but clumsy oaf of a sweetheart, Elmer, off to get help. Help comes in the form of the Stooges, who are playing a trio of cavalrymen so incompetent that their frustrated sergeant sends them on the mission only because he believes they won't return alive. The boys dress up as desperadoes and enter the town's saloon, doing their best to appear tough. While ordering drinks, Shemp asks for a milkshake "made with sour milk!" Their lack of prowess in all things Western is immediately apparent, and on top of that, the gang's leader (Kenneth MacDonald) figures out they are spies. The Stooges attempt a different kind of disguise. This time they're waiters, but their fake mustaches give them away in almost record time. Eventually they do emerge victorious over the bad guys, but it's only with Nell's help (she's upstairs, cold-cocking every bad guy who has the misfortune to enter her room), and Shemp's winning battle with two of the bad men and a stick of dynamite. Elmer shows up eventually and when he tells Nell that cowboys don't settle down, she beans him with a piece of crockery. This knocks some sense into him, ending the picture on something of a romantic note(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Fugitive</title>
    <desc lang="en">This 1993 box-office smash partly adheres to the 1960s TV series on which it is based and partly goes off on several tangents of its own. Harrison Ford stars as Dr. Richard Kimble, convicted of murdering his wife. While being transferred to prison by bus, Kimble is involved in a spectacular bus-train collision (one of the best of its kind ever filmed). Surviving the disaster, Kimble escapes, vowing to track down the elusive professional criminal whom he holds responsible for the murder. Dogging the fugitive every foot of the way is U.S. marshal Sam Gerard (an Oscar-winning turn by Tommy Lee Jones), who announces his intention to search "every whorehouse, doghouse, and outhouse" to bring Kimble to justice. Unlike his dour TV-series counterpart Barry Morse, Jones plays the role with a sardonic sense of humor: when a cornered Kimble screams, "I didn't kill my wife," Gerard shrugs and famously replies, "I don't care." Once the premise has been established, scripters Jeb Stuart and David Twohy and director Andrew Davis pull off several audacious plot twists, ranging from Kimble's rendezvous with a sympathetic lab technician to a jaw-dropping dive into a huge waterfall. The second half of the film offers one surprise after another (including the true identity of the murderer), brilliantly avoiding the letdown that plagues many movie adaptations of old TV series(n)</desc>

In one of their best Columbia shorts, The Three Stooges get involved with a professor (Harry Holmes) who wagers that he can transform the nitwits, Pygmalion-like, into refined gentleman. Written by the genial Felix Adler and directed with vim and vigor by the team's usual pilot, del Lord, Hoi Polloi is typical Stooges mayhem. In the supporting cast, Laurel &amp; Hardy veteran Blanche Payson and Jean Harlow's stand-in Mary Dees joined such Stooges regulars as Geneva Mitchell, Phyllis Crane, Grace Goodall and Robert Graves. Hoi Polloi was remade by the Stooges in 1947 as Half Wits Holiday and again in 1958, as Pies and Guys(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Fugitive</title>
    <desc lang="en">This 1993 box-office smash partly adheres to the 1960s TV series on which it is based and partly goes off on several tangents of its own. Harrison Ford stars as Dr. Richard Kimble, convicted of murdering his wife. While being transferred to prison by bus, Kimble is involved in a spectacular bus-train collision (one of the best of its kind ever filmed). Surviving the disaster, Kimble escapes, vowing to track down the elusive professional criminal whom he holds responsible for the murder. Dogging the fugitive every foot of the way is U.S. marshal Sam Gerard (an Oscar-winning turn by Tommy Lee Jones), who announces his intention to search "every whorehouse, doghouse, and outhouse" to bring Kimble to justice. Unlike his dour TV-series counterpart Barry Morse, Jones plays the role with a sardonic sense of humor: when a cornered Kimble screams, "I didn't kill my wife," Gerard shrugs and famously replies, "I don't care." Once the premise has been established, scripters Jeb Stuart and David Twohy and director Andrew Davis pull off several audacious plot twists, ranging from Kimble's rendezvous with a sympathetic lab technician to a jaw-dropping dive into a huge waterfall. The second half of the film offers one surprise after another (including the true identity of the murderer), brilliantly avoiding the letdown that plagues many movie adaptations of old TV series(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Urals. Travel through the majestic Primeval forests of the Urals. This Russian sanctuary is a land of extremes where giant deer, half-tonne leviathans and tiny adventures flourish. Eurasian elk make seasonal journeys in search of food. Unlike other deer, Eurasian elk are normally solitary and for pregnant females, the stress of meeting leads to fighting. The elk migration leads them across swollen, fast-moving rivers and while they are strong swimmers, many are lost in the treacherous journey. After many months of hibernating, it's a rude awakening for the hungry brown bear who searches for an easy kill. As the snow retreats, opportunists like lone wolves advance to feed on winter's victims. The unique Russian desman, a semi-aquatic and almost-blind relative of the mole, has scent glands at the base of its tail that gives it a musky, unappetizing smell to discourage predators(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The home potters are tested on the art of Japanese-style ceramics. For the main challenge, they throw a sake set, consisting of one bottle and six identical cups. The exciting part, however, comes during the firing, when they use a risky 16th-century method in which they pull their burning pieces out of the kiln and plunge them into a bin full of combustible materials. For the spot test, they must pierce and carve an intricate design into a lantern using a technique known as the `devil's work', and the throw down sees them back at the wheel, making as many rice bowls as they can in 15 minutes.(n)</desc>

The actor has only one photo of his ancestor, which shows him aged roughly 17 and wearing a military uniform. By zooming in on the picture, Martin's brother was able to identify their grandfather's badge, which suggests he was in the Royal Marines. Now, by meeting with a military historian, Martin tries to fill in the rest of the story, and in the process learns more about Edwin's role in defending Birmingham against German air assaults during the Second World War.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Raising Arizona</title>
    <desc lang="en">Combining influences from Tex Avery cartoons to Sam Raimi horror movies to 1940s B-movies, Joel Coen and Ethan Coen followed up the stylish film noir of their debut, Blood Simple (1984), with this frantic screwball comedy. H.I. "Hi" McDonnough (Nicholas Cage) is a philosophical but slightly dim career criminal who has been arrested so often that he gets to know "Ed," short for Edwina (Holly Hunter), the officer who takes his mug shots. Hi takes a shine to Ed and promises to go straight if she marries him. She accepts, and they move to the Arizona desert, where Hi holds down a factory job and blissfully watches the sunsets with Ed. Their serenity is shattered when the couple decides that they want a child and discover that, as Hi puts it, "Ed's womb was a rocky place where my seed could find no purchase." (One of the film's many delights is Hi's unexpectedly flowery dime-novel narration.) Ed goes into a severe depression until she sees an item in the news. Nathan Arizona (Trey Wilson), owner of a chain of unpainted furniture stores, has become the father of quintuplets, and he and his wife joke that they now have more children than they know what to do with. In what seems like a perfect "helps you, helps me" situation, Hi and Ed kidnap one of the Arizona infants, figuring that they'll have a baby and the Arizonas will have less of a burden(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Raising Arizona</title>
    <desc lang="en">Combining influences from Tex Avery cartoons to Sam Raimi horror movies to 1940s B-movies, Joel Coen and Ethan Coen followed up the stylish film noir of their debut, Blood Simple (1984), with this frantic screwball comedy. H.I. "Hi" McDonnough (Nicholas Cage) is a philosophical but slightly dim career criminal who has been arrested so often that he gets to know "Ed," short for Edwina (Holly Hunter), the officer who takes his mug shots. Hi takes a shine to Ed and promises to go straight if she marries him. She accepts, and they move to the Arizona desert, where Hi holds down a factory job and blissfully watches the sunsets with Ed. Their serenity is shattered when the couple decides that they want a child and discover that, as Hi puts it, "Ed's womb was a rocky place where my seed could find no purchase." (One of the film's many delights is Hi's unexpectedly flowery dime-novel narration.) Ed goes into a severe depression until she sees an item in the news. Nathan Arizona (Trey Wilson), owner of a chain of unpainted furniture stores, has become the father of quintuplets, and he and his wife joke that they now have more children than they know what to do with. In what seems like a perfect "helps you, helps me" situation, Hi and Ed kidnap one of the Arizona infants, figuring that they'll have a baby and the Arizonas will have less of a burden(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Hosted--or rather, refereed--by boxing expert Max Kellerman, this lively cable-TV discussion show featured four sports columnists, each from a different part of the USA, discussing recent pro-athletic developments in a sort of electronic summit meeting. Kellerman determined how much time each of the columnists would be permitted to express his or her opinions--and he was harsh indeed, frequently limiting the discourse to ten seconds or less. At the end of the show, Kellerman would award points for the most cogent opinions and arguments, and also subtract points from contributors whom he determined had not effectively expressed themselves. The inagural episode of ESPN's Around the Horn was seen on September 30, 2002(n)</desc>

She begins by heading to North America, which was home to a diverse group of giant mammals, and discovers how the sabre-toothed cat's out-sized teeth were vital for hunting, yet easily broken. Alice looks at evidence of the bear-sized Shasta ground sloth in a cave in the Grand Canyon, and learns about the strange armadillo-like glyptodont - which was the size of a small car.(n)</desc>

She begins by heading to North America, which was home to a diverse group of giant mammals, and discovers how the sabre-toothed cat's out-sized teeth were vital for hunting, yet easily broken. Alice looks at evidence of the bear-sized Shasta ground sloth in a cave in the Grand Canyon, and learns about the strange armadillo-like glyptodont - which was the size of a small car.(n)</desc>

Alice also travels to a Jersey cave, where archaeological findings shed light on how Ice Age human beings and Neanderthals fashioned stone tools to hunt mammoths.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Driver and muscle for hire Frank Martin returns in this sequel to the 2002 box-office hit. Frank Martin (Jason Statham) is a former special-forces officer who will transport anything anywhere for a price, and his latest assignment is acting as chauffeur for Jack Billings (Hunter Clary), the young son of politician Jefferson Billings (Matthew Modine), who has garnered no small amount of controversy for his aggressive efforts to stamp out the trade in illegal drugs. One day, Frank is to take Jack to the doctor for a checkup while his mother, Audrey (Amber Valletta), sets up a birthday party for the tyke. However, Jack's doctor is not who he appears to be -- he's actually Dimitri (Jason Flemyng), a Russian agent well versed in viruses who works with criminal kingpin Gianni (Alessandro Gassman). After a long and hard-fought chase with Frank, the bad guys get ahold of little Jack and hold him for ransom. The parents comply with their monetary demands and soon have their son back at home -- but little do they know that the boy has secretly been injected with a deadly and easily spread virus, which the terrorists hope to spread to the boy's powerful father and other politicians whom Jefferson will soon be addressing at a public event. When Frank learns what has happened to young Jack, he sets out to find the culprits -- and the antidote that will save the boy and all others who have been exposed to the virus from dying a painful death -- though his foes have stacked the deck so that it looks as if Frank has been complicit in the crime(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A loner (Dane DeHaan) escapes his abusive home life and discovers a mysterious crater that gives him and two fellow high school students psychokinetic powers in this found-footage-style superhero film from director Josh Trank and screenwriter Max Landis. DeHaan plays Andrew, a angsty teen whose mother is dying and whose father takes out his violent frustrations out on the boy. As a result, Andrew starts filming everything around him, including the dreadful night that he, his cousin Matt (Alex Russell) and the soon-to-be senior class president, Steve (Michael B. Jordan), wake up with superpowers after exploring a condemned piece of land housing an unexplained power source. The three bond over their newfound abilities, with Andrew clearly leading the pack in terms of control and strength. Despite their noble intentions, a darker streak appears in one of them as the other two try to take control over a situation that soon spirals into homicidal madness -- all of which is captured on camera(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The 11 remaining amateur bakers face three tasks designed to test their bread-making skills, beginning by preparing two varieties of flatbread for judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry. The hopefuls then tackle a demanding technical challenge as they try to replicate Paul's recipe for an eight-strand plaited loaf, before receiving the dubious honour of becoming the first contestants in the show's history to make bagels. At the end of the day, Paul and Mary must decide who is this round's Star Baker - and who will be going home. Presented by Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins. From 2012.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The 10 remaining amateur cooks' tart-making abilities are put to the test in the third round of the competition. Their first task is to bake a tarte Tatin, with judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry looking for intriguing flavour combinations to tickle their tastebuds. The hopefuls then face another daunting technical challenge as they try to replicate Mary's seemingly straightforward recipe for treacle tart, but the delicate task of adding a lattice top leaves some contestants flummoxed. Finally, they try to create an ornate fruit tart fit for gracing the window display of a leading patisserie - before discovering the identities of the latest Star Baker and the person who will be heading home. Presented by Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins. From 2012.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The 10 remaining amateur cooks' tart-making abilities are put to the test in the third round of the competition. Their first task is to bake a tarte Tatin, with judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry looking for intriguing flavour combinations to tickle their tastebuds. The hopefuls then face another daunting technical challenge as they try to replicate Mary's seemingly straightforward recipe for treacle tart, but the delicate task of adding a lattice top leaves some contestants flummoxed. Finally, they try to create an ornate fruit tart fit for gracing the window display of a leading patisserie - before discovering the identities of the latest Star Baker and the person who will be heading home. Presented by Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins. From 2012.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Catch Me if You Can</title>
    <desc lang="en">A gifted forger and confidence man attempts to stay one step ahead of the lawman determined to bring him to justice in this comedy-drama from Steven Spielberg, based on a true story. Frank W. Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a 16-year-old high school student who finds himself emotionally cut adrift when his mother, Paula (Nathalie Baye), leaves his father, Frank Abagnale Sr. (Christopher Walken), after Frank Sr. falls into arrears with the Internal Revenue Service. One day at school, Frank Jr. attempts to pass himself off as a substitute teacher, and easily makes the subterfuge work. His small-scale success gives Frank some ideas, and he soon discovers bigger and more profitable ways of hoaxing others, passing himself off as an airline pilot, a doctor, and an attorney. Along the way, Frank learns how to become a master forger, and uses his talent and charm to pass over 2.5 million dollars in phony checks. Frank's increasingly audacious work soon attracts the attention of Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), an FBI agent who is determined to put Frank behind bars. Frank seems to enjoy being pursued by Carl, and even goes so far as to call Carl on the phone to chat every once in a while. While posing as a doctor, Frank falls in love with Brenda Strong (Amy Adams), a sweet girl working as a candy striper. When Frank asks Brenda to marry him, he decides to assume a new identity to impress her father, Roger (Martin Sheen) -- who happens to be the District Attorney of New Orleans, LA. Catch Me If You Can was based on the autobiography of the real Frank W. Abagnale Jr., who has a cameo in the film and today works on the side of the law as a top consultant on preventing forgery and designing secure checking systems(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Speed Racer</title>
    <desc lang="en">The Matrix masterminds Andy and Larry Wachowski usher anime icon Tatsuo Yoshida's classic 1960s-era hit into the new millennium with this family-friendly story of a young racecar driver who takes on the mysterious Racer X in a custom-made, gadget-loaded speed machine named the Mach 5. Speed Racer (Emile Hirsch) is the kind of driver that every wheelman wishes he could be: a born winner whose unbeatable combination of aggression, instinct, and fearlessness always finds him crossing the checkered flag with a comfortable lead. In Speed Racer's mind, the only driver who could present him with any real challenge is his late brother -- the legendary Rex Racer. Rex died in a heated cross-country rally known as The Crucible many years ago, and now his younger sibling is driven to fulfill the legacy that Rex left behind. To this day, Speed Racer is fiercely loyal to family. It was Speed Racer's father, Pops Racer (John Goodman), who designed the unbeatable Mach 5, and even a lucrative offer from racing giants Royalton Industries isn't enough to get the young ace to break his family ties. Upon turning down Royalton's (Roger Allam) astronomical offer, Speed Racer makes the shocking discovery that the outcomes of the biggest races are being predetermined by a handful of powerful moguls who pad their profits by manipulating the drivers. Realizing that his career would be ruined if word of the fix gets out, Royalton vows that the Mach 5 will never make it to another finish line. Now, the only way for Speed Racer to save the family business and beat Royalton at his own game will be to win the very same race that claimed his brother's life so many years ago. In order to accomplish that formidable feat, however, Speed Racer will not only have to rely on his family and the aid of his longtime girlfriend, Trixie (Christina Ricci), but form a tenuous alliance with his longtime rival -- the mysterious Racer X (Matthew Fox) -- as well(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Catch Me if You Can</title>
    <desc lang="en">A gifted forger and confidence man attempts to stay one step ahead of the lawman determined to bring him to justice in this comedy-drama from Steven Spielberg, based on a true story. Frank W. Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a 16-year-old high school student who finds himself emotionally cut adrift when his mother, Paula (Nathalie Baye), leaves his father, Frank Abagnale Sr. (Christopher Walken), after Frank Sr. falls into arrears with the Internal Revenue Service. One day at school, Frank Jr. attempts to pass himself off as a substitute teacher, and easily makes the subterfuge work. His small-scale success gives Frank some ideas, and he soon discovers bigger and more profitable ways of hoaxing others, passing himself off as an airline pilot, a doctor, and an attorney. Along the way, Frank learns how to become a master forger, and uses his talent and charm to pass over 2.5 million dollars in phony checks. Frank's increasingly audacious work soon attracts the attention of Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), an FBI agent who is determined to put Frank behind bars. Frank seems to enjoy being pursued by Carl, and even goes so far as to call Carl on the phone to chat every once in a while. While posing as a doctor, Frank falls in love with Brenda Strong (Amy Adams), a sweet girl working as a candy striper. When Frank asks Brenda to marry him, he decides to assume a new identity to impress her father, Roger (Martin Sheen) -- who happens to be the District Attorney of New Orleans, LA. Catch Me If You Can was based on the autobiography of the real Frank W. Abagnale Jr., who has a cameo in the film and today works on the side of the law as a top consultant on preventing forgery and designing secure checking systems(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Speed Racer</title>
    <desc lang="en">The Matrix masterminds Andy and Larry Wachowski usher anime icon Tatsuo Yoshida's classic 1960s-era hit into the new millennium with this family-friendly story of a young racecar driver who takes on the mysterious Racer X in a custom-made, gadget-loaded speed machine named the Mach 5. Speed Racer (Emile Hirsch) is the kind of driver that every wheelman wishes he could be: a born winner whose unbeatable combination of aggression, instinct, and fearlessness always finds him crossing the checkered flag with a comfortable lead. In Speed Racer's mind, the only driver who could present him with any real challenge is his late brother -- the legendary Rex Racer. Rex died in a heated cross-country rally known as The Crucible many years ago, and now his younger sibling is driven to fulfill the legacy that Rex left behind. To this day, Speed Racer is fiercely loyal to family. It was Speed Racer's father, Pops Racer (John Goodman), who designed the unbeatable Mach 5, and even a lucrative offer from racing giants Royalton Industries isn't enough to get the young ace to break his family ties. Upon turning down Royalton's (Roger Allam) astronomical offer, Speed Racer makes the shocking discovery that the outcomes of the biggest races are being predetermined by a handful of powerful moguls who pad their profits by manipulating the drivers. Realizing that his career would be ruined if word of the fix gets out, Royalton vows that the Mach 5 will never make it to another finish line. Now, the only way for Speed Racer to save the family business and beat Royalton at his own game will be to win the very same race that claimed his brother's life so many years ago. In order to accomplish that formidable feat, however, Speed Racer will not only have to rely on his family and the aid of his longtime girlfriend, Trixie (Christina Ricci), but form a tenuous alliance with his longtime rival -- the mysterious Racer X (Matthew Fox) -- as well(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Catch Me if You Can</title>
    <desc lang="en">A gifted forger and confidence man attempts to stay one step ahead of the lawman determined to bring him to justice in this comedy-drama from Steven Spielberg, based on a true story. Frank W. Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a 16-year-old high school student who finds himself emotionally cut adrift when his mother, Paula (Nathalie Baye), leaves his father, Frank Abagnale Sr. (Christopher Walken), after Frank Sr. falls into arrears with the Internal Revenue Service. One day at school, Frank Jr. attempts to pass himself off as a substitute teacher, and easily makes the subterfuge work. His small-scale success gives Frank some ideas, and he soon discovers bigger and more profitable ways of hoaxing others, passing himself off as an airline pilot, a doctor, and an attorney. Along the way, Frank learns how to become a master forger, and uses his talent and charm to pass over 2.5 million dollars in phony checks. Frank's increasingly audacious work soon attracts the attention of Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), an FBI agent who is determined to put Frank behind bars.

A veteran professional wrestler (Oliver Platt) is no longer winning matches, thus disappointing his fans, especially a pair of grappling enthusiasts (David Arquette and Scott Caan) who regard the aging fighter as their hero. They come up with what they believe is a foolproof plan to put their favorite fighter back on top: they'll pose as a wrestling tag team, stage a match with their favorite, lose in a truly embarrassing manner, and thus clear the way for his comeback. But is returning to the top of the card really this simple? Ready to Rumble also features Martin Landau and Rose McGowan, with several stars from the WCW professional wrestling league playing themselves, including Bill Goldberg(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A gifted forger and confidence man attempts to stay one step ahead of the lawman determined to bring him to justice in this comedy-drama from Steven Spielberg, based on a true story. Frank W. Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a 16-year-old high school student who finds himself emotionally cut adrift when his mother, Paula (Nathalie Baye), leaves his father, Frank Abagnale Sr. (Christopher Walken), after Frank Sr. falls into arrears with the Internal Revenue Service. One day at school, Frank Jr. attempts to pass himself off as a substitute teacher, and easily makes the subterfuge work. His small-scale success gives Frank some ideas, and he soon discovers bigger and more profitable ways of hoaxing others, passing himself off as an airline pilot, a doctor, and an attorney. Along the way, Frank learns how to become a master forger, and uses his talent and charm to pass over 2.5 million dollars in phony checks. Frank's increasingly audacious work soon attracts the attention of Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), an FBI agent who is determined to put Frank behind bars. Frank seems to enjoy being pursued by Carl, and even goes so far as to call Carl on the phone to chat every once in a while. While posing as a doctor, Frank falls in love with Brenda Strong (Amy Adams), a sweet girl working as a candy striper. When Frank asks Brenda to marry him, he decides to assume a new identity to impress her father, Roger (Martin Sheen) -- who happens to be the District Attorney of New Orleans, LA.

    <desc lang="en">After executive producing the acclaimed documentary Manda Bala and the J.M. Coetzee adaptation Disgrace, Julio DePietro makes his feature debut as a writer-director with The Good Guy, a drama about ambitious young Wall Streeters fighting each other -- and sometimes their own decent nature -- to get ahead in the world. Our narrator, Tommy (Scott Porter of TV's Friday Night Lights), is young, clever, charming, and attractive. He's got a smart, pretty girlfriend, Beth (Alexis Bledel of Gilmore Girls), an urban conservationist. He's also very good at his investment broker job, impressing his ruthless, cynical boss, Cash (erstwhile "Brat Pack" member Andrew McCarthy). When a key member of Tommy's sales team suddenly leaves for a competitor, Tommy needs to fill his spot quickly, and takes a chance on the bumbling Daniel (Bryan Greenberg, Bride Wars), a former Marine and computer geek who seems a bit naïve about high finance and a bit nervous around women. Tommy takes Daniel under his wing, showing him how to dress, where to socialize, and how to charm attractive women. Their relationship is threatened when Daniel begins spending more time with Beth, joining her book club, and becoming her confidant. Tommy begins to question his decision to share his wisdom with Daniel, while Daniel is forced to decide what success really means to him, and where his loyalties lie. The Good Guy also stars Anna Chlumsky (In the Loop) and Aaron Yoo (Disturbia). The film had its world premiere at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival(n)</desc>

He's an alcoholic homeless man huddling inside a box on a dingy London alley with a fellow homeless woman when a couple of criminals start harassing the junkies and the destitute. He reverts to his training, subdues the baddies, and makes a run for it, ending up in the home of a wealthy creative type who happens to be in New York for the next eight months. Smith movies in, cleans himself up, and gets a job as a toughman for a local Asian gangster. Haunted by horrific acts he committed while serving in Afghanistan, he spends much of the money he makes now to help fund a local soup kitchen run by Sister Cristina (Agata Buzek). When the woman he was with at the beginning of the movie turns up dead, Smith decides to hunt down the man responsible. Meanwhile, Cristina questions her own faith, confronts her haunted past, and makes Smith contemplate his own violent nature.

    <title lang="en">Redemption</title>
    <desc lang="en">Writer/director Steven Knight's Redemption stars Jason Statham as a British Special Forces veteran named Smith who has fallen on very hard times. He's an alcoholic homeless man huddling inside a box on a dingy London alley with a fellow homeless woman when a couple of criminals start harassing the junkies and the destitute. He reverts to his training, subdues the baddies, and makes a run for it, ending up in the home of a wealthy creative type who happens to be in New York for the next eight months. Smith movies in, cleans himself up, and gets a job as a toughman for a local Asian gangster. Haunted by horrific acts he committed while serving in Afghanistan, he spends much of the money he makes now to help fund a local soup kitchen run by Sister Cristina (Agata Buzek). When the woman he was with at the beginning of the movie turns up dead, Smith decides to hunt down the man responsible. Meanwhile, Cristina questions her own faith, confronts her haunted past, and makes Smith contemplate his own violent nature. Redemption is the feature directorial debut for Knight, who had previously scripted Eastern Promises and Dirty Pretty Things(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Kick-Ass</title>
    <desc lang="en">Matthew Vaughn's violent-but-hilarious action movie is a knowing take on the superhero genre, based on Mark Millar and John Romita Jr's comic-book series. Avid comic fan and New York high schooler Dave Lizewski has begun to wonder why his contemporaries are keener on vapid celebrity than wanting to emulate his (super) heroes and try to make the world a better place. Thus Lizewski orders a simply hideous skiing outfit and dons it to become Kick-Ass, scourge of New York's criminals. Well that's the idea, but of course it's his ass that gets kicked when he first tries to put his plan into action. Despite that setback, and spurred on by his desire for a female classmate, he has another go at launching his crime-fighting career. It almost ends as badly as the first one, but this time he's rescued by fellow 'superheroes' Hit Girl and Big Daddy. She's just 11 years old, but has a taste and aptitude for violence that would impress a ninja and swears frequently and badly enough to shock a football fan; he's ever the doting father, gifting her presents of lethal weapons. Together the trio embark on their quest to clean up the city. But waiting in the wings is crime boss Frank D'Amico - and he's no pushover. The film's controversial mix of humour, bad language, sophisticated satire and frequent violence garnered a raft of awards as well as widespread critical acclaim(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Wishin' and Hopin'. Miraculousy, Meredith's mom Ellis (Kate Burton) becomes lucid for the first time since being stricken with Alzheimers'. Unfortunately, Ellis' first words are not entirely flattering to Meredith (Ellen Pompeo)--in fact, they're downright abusive. Meanwhile, a patient's toxic blood may prove dangerous to three of the surgeons; Izzy (Katherine Heigl) has quite a conversation with the first client at the Denny Duquette memorial clinic; Cristina (Sandra Oh) gives serious consideration to Burke's proposal; and the eminent retirement of Dr. Webber (James Pickens Jr.) results in "competition fever". The episode ends as George (T.R. Knight) and Callie (Sara Ramirez) return from Vegas with a big surprise--as if we couldn't have guessed the nature of that surprise from what took place in the previous episode!(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Croczilla. The saltwater crocodile is one of the world's stealthiest- and most fearful- predators. They stalk silently and attack rapidly. And they're massive - growing to lengths of more than 20 feet and weighing as much as 3,000 pounds. Their bite force is strong enough to break the neck of large cattle. We film zoologist Adam Britton as he tags aggressive rogue crocodiles that live in the river systems outside of Darwin, Australia, trying to figure out why the crocs are moving closer to human populations, and how to keep the locals safe. We also follow Dr. Greg Erickson as he undertakes the dangerous task of trying to measure the massive power of the saltie crocodile's bite force. A recent discovery of an ancient ancestor called Sarcosuchus imperator suggests the crocodile could get a whole lot bigger. Is it possible that under the right conditions, the saltwater crocodile could reach these nightmarish proportions? In How Big Can it Get? Snakezilla we find out(n)</desc>

Pythons capture prey by slow stalking - or ambush. We film as biologist Joe Wasilewski goes out into the Everglades National Park area and hunts for large invasive Burmese pythons.

    <desc lang="en">Predator Swarm. In Africa, strength in numbers can tip the scales of survival. Teamwork ups the hunters' odds, but sometimes sheer numbers can decide who lives or dies. Common dolphins are a well-co-ordinated army, capable of rounding up and decimating thousands of sardines at a time, but even solitary predators attack in droves when the stakes are high enough: lone sharks descend on the Sardine Run in scores for the feeding frenzy of the year, and crocodiles set the Luangwa river boiling with scales as they join forces to tear apart their prey. With an army on your side, size doesn't count: working together, wild dogs take down prey ten times their size; buffalo herds hundreds strong turn attacking lions into targets; and tightknit mongoose families literally eat their predators for dinner. This episode proves beyond a doubt that for many of Africa's Deadliest, numbers are everything(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">New series. Cillian Murphy returns as Birmingham-based mobster Thomas Shelby in the second run of author Steven Knight's period drama, which is set to reunite the Irish star with his Dark Knight Rises colleague Tom Hardy. The first series was a huge success for the BBC, winning plaudits not only for its plot and acting, but also for its amazing production design, which helped create an atmosphere of threat and foreboding in the Midlands immediately after the First World War. Now the action moves on to the Roaring Twenties, and Thomas is determined to expand the legal and illegal sides of the Shelby family business by taking on various interests in the south of England. But an enemy from his past looks set to stand in his way.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The film follows a Jewish family living in Hungary through three generations, and rising from humble beginnings to positions of wealth and power in the crumbling Austro-Hungarian Empire. Ignatz, the patriarch rises from poverty to become a prominent judge and model conservative. But his prosperity proves short-lived, since he must eventually confront the changing attitudes of the Hungarian majority. Ignatz is torn when his government sanctions Jewish persecutions, something that creates a rift between him and his beloved wife Valerie (played alternately by veteran actress Rosemary Harris and her daughter Jennifer Ehle), while his brother Gustave, fearful of the growing anti-semitic feeling, throws himself into Communism instead. His son Adam (also played by Fiennes) converts to Christianity to advance his career as a champion fencer and Olympic hero, but finds his patriotism rejected as he is inexorably caught up in the Holocaust. Finally, Istvan (Fiennes again), his grandson, who must constantly change his allegiances in order to survive the war, revolution, loss and betrayal, realizes that his ultimate loyalty must be to his family, his heritage, and himself(n)</desc>

This historical and personal film tells the story of several Cuban exiles who left their island country from the port of Mariel during the boatlift of 1980. Following a rush on the embassy in Havana, more than 100,000 Cubans fled their homeland in hopes of creating a new life in the U.S. A mass of Cuban residents -- from average middle-class families to hardened criminals -- huddled onto boats. Upon their arrival in Florida, many of them were met with violence. Perez-Ray visits with many of the surviving exiles for in-depth interviews(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Tyler Perry's The Family That Preys</title>
    <desc lang="en">Alfre Woodard and Kathy Bates star in writer/director Tyler Perry's family drama about an upper-crust family and their working-class counterparts, who discover that scandal knows no social boundaries. Charlotte Cartwright (Bates) and Alice Pratt (Woodard) may be from different sides of the tracks, yet over the years they've managed to nurture a strong and healthy friendship. That friendship is put to the ultimate test, however, when their adult children begin to act out in ways that neither parent ever saw coming. Alice's daughter Andrea (Sanaa Lathan) is married to a trusting husband named Chris (Rockmond Dunbar), but lately she's been betraying that trust by sleeping with her boss, William (Cole Hauser), who just so happens to be Charlotte's son. William is married to Jillian (KaDee Strickland), and in addition to being unfaithful, he's also scheming to take over the role of COO at his mother's lucrative construction firm. Meanwhile, Alice's other daughter, Pam (Taraji P. Henson), and her husband, Ben (Perry), a faithful family man and construction worker, have both recognized that their family has strayed from the course of righteousness, and become determined to help their loved ones back on the right path. When paternity secrets, shady double dealings, and a series of other scandals become too much for Charlotte and Alice to take, the two women set out on a cross-country trip in order to clear their heads and devise a plan for saving their families(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Tyler Perry's The Family That Preys</title>
    <desc lang="en">Alfre Woodard and Kathy Bates star in writer/director Tyler Perry's family drama about an upper-crust family and their working-class counterparts, who discover that scandal knows no social boundaries. Charlotte Cartwright (Bates) and Alice Pratt (Woodard) may be from different sides of the tracks, yet over the years they've managed to nurture a strong and healthy friendship. That friendship is put to the ultimate test, however, when their adult children begin to act out in ways that neither parent ever saw coming. Alice's daughter Andrea (Sanaa Lathan) is married to a trusting husband named Chris (Rockmond Dunbar), but lately she's been betraying that trust by sleeping with her boss, William (Cole Hauser), who just so happens to be Charlotte's son. William is married to Jillian (KaDee Strickland), and in addition to being unfaithful, he's also scheming to take over the role of COO at his mother's lucrative construction firm. Meanwhile, Alice's other daughter, Pam (Taraji P. Henson), and her husband, Ben (Perry), a faithful family man and construction worker, have both recognized that their family has strayed from the course of righteousness, and become determined to help their loved ones back on the right path. When paternity secrets, shady double dealings, and a series of other scandals become too much for Charlotte and Alice to take, the two women set out on a cross-country trip in order to clear their heads and devise a plan for saving their families(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The film follows a Jewish family living in Hungary through three generations, and rising from humble beginnings to positions of wealth and power in the crumbling Austro-Hungarian Empire. Ignatz, the patriarch rises from poverty to become a prominent judge and model conservative. But his prosperity proves short-lived, since he must eventually confront the changing attitudes of the Hungarian majority. Ignatz is torn when his government sanctions Jewish persecutions, something that creates a rift between him and his beloved wife Valerie (played alternately by veteran actress Rosemary Harris and her daughter Jennifer Ehle), while his brother Gustave, fearful of the growing anti-semitic feeling, throws himself into Communism instead. His son Adam (also played by Fiennes) converts to Christianity to advance his career as a champion fencer and Olympic hero, but finds his patriotism rejected as he is inexorably caught up in the Holocaust. Finally, Istvan (Fiennes again), his grandson, who must constantly change his allegiances in order to survive the war, revolution, loss and betrayal, realizes that his ultimate loyalty must be to his family, his heritage, and himself(n)</desc>

Following a rush on the embassy in Havana, more than 100,000 Cubans fled their homeland in hopes of creating a new life in the U.S. A mass of Cuban residents -- from average middle-class families to hardened criminals -- huddled onto boats. Upon their arrival in Florida, many of them were met with violence. Perez-Ray visits with many of the surviving exiles for in-depth interviews(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A drug dealer moves on to bigger crimes in an effort to settle a score with disastrous results in this drama inspired by actual events. Though barely out of his teens, Johnny Truelove (Emile Hirsch) has already built a lucrative career for himself selling drugs -- he has his own home, a luxury car, and posse of friends who do double duty as his crew, including Elvis (Shawn Hatosy), Frankie (Justin Timberlake), and Tiko (Fernando Vargas). While life at Johnny's house is usually a constant party interrupted by occasional dope deals, Johnny has lost all of his patience with Jake Mazursky (Ben Foster), a regular customer who has run up a large tab that he can't pay. Determined to clear Jake's account, Johnny and his boys plan to kidnap Jake and hold him for ransom, but when they happen upon his 15-year-old stepbrother, Zack (Anton Yelchin), they impulsively decide to take the youngster instead. Jake's father, Butch (David Thornton), and his stepmother, Olivia (Sharon Stone), are already furious with their junkie son when they learn about Zack's disappearance, and aren't sure what they should do. Meanwhile at Johnny's place, Frankie takes a liking to young Zack, who already admires his brother's high-flying lifestyle, and introduces the kid to the joys of grown-up partying, which he takes to with dangerous zeal. Also featuring Bruce Willis as Johnny's father, Alpha Dog was based on the real-life story of Jesse James Hollywood, who at the age of 21 became one of the youngest people to ever appear on the FBI's "Most Wanted" list(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle director Stephen Chow returns to the helm for this sci-fi comedy about a struggling single father whose quest to find the perfect toy yields out-of-this-world results. Ti (Chow) is a poor construction worker who breaks his back to ensure that his young son Dicky (Xu Jiao) can stay enrolled in an exclusive private school. But while Ti does everything possible to give his son the opportunities that he never had, Dicky still feels like a classroom reject due to his tattered clothes and lack of the latest toys. Dicky's classmates all play with the coolest and most expensive gadgets that money can buy, so how is a kid who gets his toys from the local junkyard ever supposed to fit in? One day, while scrounging through the trash heap in search of a new toy, Ti discovers a mysterious orb and brings it straight back to Dicky. Though at first the "CJ7" appears to be little more than an unidentifiable oddity, it proves to be much, much more once the young boy starts to play with it. This isn't your average action figure, but a living "pet" with extraordinary powers. Realizing that his new toy may be just the thing to help him fit in with his demanding classmates, Dicky brings the CJ7 to school with him in order to show it off and have some fun. But the CJ7 has its own ideas about how to have fun, and it isn't long before the situation at school gets hopelessly out of hand(n)</desc>

Xavier (Romain Duris) is a French economics student who is nearing the completion of his degree and is looking for work. Xavier's father arranges for him to meet a ranking member of the Ministry of Finance, who makes him an offer -- he can give him a good job, but only under the condition that he learn to speak Spanish. Determined not to pass up the opportunity, Xavier enrolls in a language program in Barcelona, despite the misgivings of his girlfriend, Martine (Audrey Tautou). Upon his arrival, Xavier moves into a large house shared by a large group of students from all over Europe. Xavier finds that his ideas and attitudes are challenged in a positive way by the diverse personalities of his housemates, and that his loyalty to Martine is tested by his attraction to Anne-Sophie (Judith Godrèche), a sweet but lonesome woman from France who has been away from her husband for too long. After a visit, most of Xavier's roommates decide they don't much care for Martine and Xavier gets advice on seducing Anne-Sophie from an unexpected source -- Isabelle (Cécile de France), a footloose lesbian living in the house. L'Auberge Espagnole received its world premier at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival, and went on to earn prizes at the 2002 Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, the 2003 Lumière Awards, and the 2003 César Awards(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Gabrielle Union, Morris Chestnut, Queen Latifah, and Terrence Howard star in a film concerning a young girl who implores a department-store Santa to find a new husband for her divorced mother for Christmas. Single mother of three Nancy (Union) has been putting the needs of her three children ahead of her own for as far back as she can remember, and lately her youngest daughter, Emily (Khail Bryant), has become acutely aware of her mother's palpable sadness. As Christmas draws near, Nancy takes her kids to the mall for a cheerful visit with jolly old Saint Nick. When it comes time for Emily's turn to sit on Santa's lap and make her Christmas wish, she selflessly remembers her mother's recent comment that a compliment from a man would be the best gift of all. Determined to make her mother happy again even if it means sacrificing her own wish, Emily relays the message to Santa (Chestnut), not realizing that the man beneath the beard is actually an office-supply salesman and ambitious singer/songwriter named Benjamin. Recognizing the daughter's love for her mother and sensing something truly special in Nancy, Benjamin cheerfully obliges the young girl, setting into motion a series of events that promise to make this the most memorable holiday in quite some time.

    <desc lang="en">Two strong-willed women wield their influence on a shy teenaged boy in this coming-of-age comedy from the United Kingdom. Seventeen-year-old Ben (Rupert Grint) is the son of a soft-spoken vicar (Nicholas Farrell), but it's his mother, Laura (Laura Linney), who rules the household, and she has put Ben cheerfully under her thumb, keeping him busy with a variety of good-will errands for the church and numerous local charity causes. With summer vacation looming before him, Ben is looking forward to learning to drive, but Laura is more interested in spending time with one of the more charming members of the church staff than helping Ben learn how to operate the family automobile. Wanting to earn some pocket money, Ben starts looking for a part-time job and ends up working for Evie Walton (Julie Walters), an elderly and slightly eccentric actress who needs help keeping her garden in shape. Laura believes Evie isn't an especially good influence on her son, though Ben is happy to find someone who encourages his interest in poetry and the larger world (especially girls). One day, Evie announces that she needs to ride to Edinburgh, where she is supposed to give a reading as part of the city's massive music and arts festival. While Ben doesn't have his license, he volunteers to take the wheel, and soon he's confronted with various forms of decadence that his mother has frequently warned him to avoid.

    <title lang="en">The Minus Man</title>
    <desc lang="en">Notable as the directorial debut of Blade Runner co-scripter Hampton Fancher, this darkly comic thriller stars affable Owen Wilson as Vann Siegert, a different brand of serial killer: one who actually believes he's doing his deeply depressed victims a service of mercy. Wandering up the West Coast, Vann chooses victims from a parade of colorful social misfits -- including a haggard junkie (singer Sheryl Crow) whose pain he ends with a nip from his flask of poison amaretto -- and expounds on his motives with a pocket tape recorder (a drawling monologue that serves as the film's narrative voice-over). A brief layover in Owensville eventually finds Vann in the company of quarreling middle-aged couple Doug and Jane (Brian Cox and Mercedes Ruehl), who grow fond of the young drifter's amiable demeanor and take him on as a boarder. After landing a job at the local post office, Vann catches the eye of co-worker Ferrin (Janeane Garofalo), and a tentative romance blossoms -- but even love can't distract Vann from his crusade to terminate people's unhappiness: "They come to me like moths, because I shine," he explains. Though not the complex psychological game it purports to be, The Minus Man is an intriguing character study -- imagine a kindler, gentler version of Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer -- with some clever twists and fine performances, including a touching portrayal from the usually acerbic Garofalo. Geared more to the art-movie crowd than to fans of Hitchcockian thrills, this film opened to raves at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival(n)</desc>

A chance meeting with Prince Henry, heir apparent to the throne, leads to the potential for a romance that she fears could be ruined if he discovers a masquerade. A 'fairy-godmother' in the shape of Leonardo da Vinci eventually smoothes the path of true love but thanks to Barrymore, this is not another soft retelling of Cinderella but a punchy, energetic film with Barrymore in excellent form as the forthright Danielle(n)</desc>

Rosenthal. Richard Erdman stars as McNulty, a nonstop talker and crashing bore. Unable to engage anyone in conversation, McNulty decides to manufacture a few "pregnant pauses" of his own with the aid of a magic stopwatch, given to him by a batty barfly named Potts (Leon Belasco). Though essentially a comedy, "A Kind of a Stopwatch" boasts an unusually unsettling denouement(n)</desc>

In the tradition of his earlier Alcoa/Goodyear Theater episode "Eddie," Mickey Rooney delivers a tour de force solo performance in the Twilight Zone playlet "The Last Night of a Jockey." Barred from the track for life, crooked jockey Grady (Rooney) boozily expresses the wish to escape his sordid surroundings and become a truly "big man." His wish is granted by his lookalike alter ego (also Rooney), but there's a heavy price to be paid at fadeout time. The first Twilight Zone to be produced by William Froug, "The Last Night of a Jockey" was originally broadcast October 25, 1963(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">After the runaway success of Jeepers Creepers in 2001, it was inevitable there would be a sequel, but this is just as smart and scary as the original. The Creeper has just two days of his allotted 23 on earth left to both eat his fill and replenish body parts that have decayed during his enforced years of hibernation.

Victor Salva's film is satisfyingly full of edge-of-the-seat moments, not to mention the required quota of gruesome deaths and gore(n)</desc>
