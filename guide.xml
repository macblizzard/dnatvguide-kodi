    <title lang="en">Parenthood</title>
    <desc lang="en">This feel-good ensemble comedy tracks a quartet of suburban siblings and their families over the course of a single summer. Hardworking Gil Buckman (Steve Martin) and his stay-at-home wife, Karen (Mary Steeenburgen), have just a few months to help their oldest son, Kevin (Jasen Fisher), overcome his high-strung behavior problems before he'll be relegated to special-education classes. Gil's difficult relationship with his own father, Frank (Jason Robards), has led him to become a would-be super-dad for his three kids, so he takes his son's difficulties more than a little personally. Gil's sister, Helen (Dianne Wiest), is trying to raise a moody, adolescent son (Leaf Phoenix) and an independent-minded daughter (Martha Plimpton) with no help from her well-off ex-husband, who's more interested in his new wife and family. Gil and Helen's sister, Susan (Harley Jane Kozak), meanwhile, must participate in the too-scripted Big Life Plans of her anal-retentive husband, Nathan (Rick Moranis), whose overachiever zeal infects even their toddler daughter. When long-lost brother Larry (Tom Hulce) show up with yet another get-rich-quick scheme, he brings with him a surprise addition to the family. Screenwriters Babaloo Mandel, Lowell Ganz, and Ron Howard negotiate their varied subplots with a deftness and comedic touch that transforms this conflicted clan into a suburban everyfamily(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Snow Angels</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director/screenwriter David Gordon Green adapts Stewart O'Nan's popular novel to the screen in this feature, which tells the parallel tales of a teenager named Arthur (Michael Angarano) and his onetime babysitter Annie (Kate Beckinsale) -- whose turbulent relationship with her estranged husband, Glenn (Sam Rockwell), leads the small-town waitress down a troubled path. Arthur is a high-school student from a dysfunctional family, and does everything in his power to avoid hanging around the house while mom and dad quarrel. When he's not practicing his trombone and performing with the high-school marching band, Arthur can usually be found bussing tables at the local Chinese restaurant and flirting with older waitress Annie. Annie used to be Arthur's babysitter, and is currently struggling to separate from her former high-school sweetheart, Glenn. But being a single mother isn't easy, especially since the troubled Glenn wants nothing more than to clean up his act and reunite his family. Back at school, Arthur and pretty classmate Lila (Olivia Thirlby) have been bonding over their mutual love for all things geeky. Though the casual friendship shows promise of evolving into something more when Lila expresses her true feelings for Arthur, he can't help but becoming distracted by his chaotic family life: his father is moving out of the family home, and his mother is doing everything in her power to maintain some semblance of normalcy. Realizing that happiness is fleeting as his family becomes shattered and Annie experiences a series of distressing encounters with Glenn, Arthur gradually begins to fall for Lisa despite his growing cynicism concerning long-term relationships. Later, on a cold winter morning, Glenn and Annie's past catches up with them in a blinding flash, and the lives of everyone they know are suddenly and irrevocably changed(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Inspector Ichabod Crane of the New York police arrives in the small village of Sleepy Hollow in 1799 to solve a murder mystery. All the victims found with their head missing, and everybody is talking about the ghost of the headless horseman at large in the woods, seeking revenge for his murder many years ago. A visual feast from Batman director Tim Burton, with a top-notch cast including the luminous Christina Ricci. Depp is a revelation, camp and twitchy - perhaps his best performance yet(n)</desc>

Regular weekly features included "K9 Cops and Animal Heroes," "Celebrity Owners," and "Animal Bloopers." First telecast in the fall of 1995, Wild About Animals was still flourishing at the end of the 20th century, by which time it was being shown in tandem with two other Rotfield efforts, The Lighter Side of Sports and Awesome Adventures, in most local markets(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The body count continues to rise in Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan -- although Jason doesn't take Manhattan until a good hour into the movie. The film begins, once again at Camp Crystal Lake, where two young goofs throw an anchor into a submerged power cable. The electrical jolt revives the ever popular and resolute maniacal killer Jason Vorhees. After dispatching the two idiots, Jason latches onto a rundown freighter, passing as a cruise ship called the Lazarus, where the Crystal Lake High School seniors are celebrating their senior trip by sailing to New York City. Like a kid in a candy store, Jason takes advantage of the close quarters of the freighter by attacking and killing an assortment of high-school slasher movie stereotypes. By the time the boat reaches Manhattan, the radio is dead along with most of the people. The survivors swim ashore to escape the mad killer. But Jason tags along behind them, eager to sink his teeth into The Big Apple(n)</desc>

The cable documentary series Weaponology investigates the science of warfare as it has progressed and developed - over the centuries - from crude battlefield contraptions to diabolically inventive weaponry. Each episode hones in on one particular category of weapon and discusses its background, evolution and strategic employment on the front lines. Episode Five, "Vertical Take-Off," sets forth and defends the thesis that VTO aircraft (an abbreviation for 'Vertical Take Off') harbor greater versatility and ingenuity than almost any other contemporary war vehicles - from their aviation methods, to their detection systems and sleek, innovative engine design. The episode then proceeds to discuss the myriad of ways in which the advantages of the said aircraft enable soldiers to gain inestimable advantages in mid-air combat(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Others</title>
    <desc lang="en">(2001) Alejandro Amenábar's haunting thriller stars Nicole Kidman as Grace Stewart, who lives in a mansion on Jersey in the days just after WWII with her two children. Also part of the household are three elderly servants who appeared as if from nowhere to replace those who left suddenly. The two children, Nicholas and Anne (James Bentley and Alakina Mann) are photosensitive and must never be exposed to light, so all curtains and doors are kept firmly shut. Anne starts claiming that there are other people in the house, something Grace denies until inexplicable events begin to convince her that they are not alone. But who are these Others? Nicole Kidman also stars in the Network Premiere of Australia on Channel 4 tomorrow. M,W,S,HD(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Richard Hammond presents this chilly version of Total Wipeout, which sees the contestants wrapping up warm to tackle a snow-covered course with winter-themed obstacles and seasonal challenges. They must manoeuvre themselves past Granny's House, watching out for the angry dog nipping at their ankles and a front door guaranteed to smack them in the face. They then cling onto the ski lift to avoid plunging into the icy waters, before riding the conveyor belt that throws them onto those old Wipeout favourites, the big red balls. Amanda Byram laughs it up at the side of the course.(n)</desc>

Don Johnson plays Ben Quick, a Southern drifter who is under suspicion as a "barn burner." Ben secures a job at the Mississippi mansion of town-boss Will Varner (Jason Robards). Varner's daughter Noel (Judith Ivey) and daughter-in-law Eula (Cybill Shepherd) vie for the handsome Ben's attention, while the patriarch's weakling son Jody (William Russ) seethes. When a few local barns are burned, Ben is the primary suspect-and no one is more suspicious than Noel. A murder trial and lynch mob both figure into the second half of the two-part The Long Hot Summer; the film originally aired October 6 and 7, 1985(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Sweet Dreams</title>
    <desc lang="en">Sweet Dreams stars Jessica Lange as country-western singer Patsy Cline, whose tragic death in 1963 cut short one of the most fabulous success stories in the annals of popular music. Robert Getchell's screenplay goes the usual route of contrasting Cline's rise to fame in the years between 1956 and 1963 with her turbulent private life. As the wife of hard-drinking Charlie Dick (Ed Harris),Cline is subjected to all manner of abuse and humiliation, yet she stays with Charlie long beyond normal human endurance. A happy second marriage is all too short-lived--as is Cline herself. While the Cline-Dick relationship is presented relatively realistically, the film makes a number of chronological errors concerning Cline's "public" life. Also: how can anyone know what was being said in the last horrifying seconds before Cline's fatal plane crash? Unlike its role model Coal Miner's Daughter (in which Beverly D'Angelo played Cline), Sweet Dreams does not feature the voice of its star during the musical scenes; instead, actual recordings of Patsy Cline, electronically enhanced to match modern technology, are heard on the soundtrack. Song highlights include "Crazy," "I Fall to Pieces," and the title tune(n)</desc>

Don Johnson plays Ben Quick, a Southern drifter who is under suspicion as a "barn burner." Ben secures a job at the Mississippi mansion of town-boss Will Varner (Jason Robards). Varner's daughter Noel (Judith Ivey) and daughter-in-law Eula (Cybill Shepherd) vie for the handsome Ben's attention, while the patriarch's weakling son Jody (William Russ) seethes. When a few local barns are burned, Ben is the primary suspect-and no one is more suspicious than Noel. A murder trial and lynch mob both figure into the second half of the two-part The Long Hot Summer; the film originally aired October 6 and 7, 1985(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Sweet Dreams</title>
    <desc lang="en">Sweet Dreams stars Jessica Lange as country-western singer Patsy Cline, whose tragic death in 1963 cut short one of the most fabulous success stories in the annals of popular music. Robert Getchell's screenplay goes the usual route of contrasting Cline's rise to fame in the years between 1956 and 1963 with her turbulent private life. As the wife of hard-drinking Charlie Dick (Ed Harris),Cline is subjected to all manner of abuse and humiliation, yet she stays with Charlie long beyond normal human endurance. A happy second marriage is all too short-lived--as is Cline herself. While the Cline-Dick relationship is presented relatively realistically, the film makes a number of chronological errors concerning Cline's "public" life. Also: how can anyone know what was being said in the last horrifying seconds before Cline's fatal plane crash? Unlike its role model Coal Miner's Daughter (in which Beverly D'Angelo played Cline), Sweet Dreams does not feature the voice of its star during the musical scenes; instead, actual recordings of Patsy Cline, electronically enhanced to match modern technology, are heard on the soundtrack. Song highlights include "Crazy," "I Fall to Pieces," and the title tune(n)</desc>

Wealthy and well-connected, Tom Capano was still subjected to the torments of the heart. When an affair with Anne Marie Fahey ended badly, he snapped. After murdering his ex-lover, Capano dumped her body in the water, a seemingly clever move. However, Capano never counted on the guilty conscience of his own brother to secure his undoing. The police kept the jealous boyfriend under surveillance until they had the sibling's confession as accomplice. Surprisingly, at trial, Capano himself admitted to removing the body. But, he held onto the claim that Fahey was killed by someone else. Capano was convicted and sentenced to death(n)</desc>

Youth, seduction, and violence populate the landscape of the A&amp;E program American Justice: Crimes of Passion -- The Pamela Smart Story. As an attractive motivated schoolteacher, Pam Smart was carving out a successful middle-class life. But, inwardly, she was passionately dissatisfied. Her husband held her back, yet she couldn't afford to live alone. Then, Smart met teenager Bill Flynn. He fell for her and she seemed flattered by the attention. Eventually, their relationship became intimate and Smart found the answer to all her problems. Through manipulation and claims of abuse, she convinced her young lover to kill her husband and that's just what he did with the help of two friends. But, Smart's calculating manner gave her away when police suspected her of being less than grief-stricken. What followed was the first live broadcast trial in history. The media explosion surrounding the case was unparalleled. Smart turned out to be a lot less organized than she thought.

    <title lang="en">The Fly</title>
    <desc lang="en">Wealthy Helene Delambre (Patricia Owens) is discovered late at night in the factory owned by her husband Andre (David Hedison). Helene stands beside a huge metal press, which has crushed the head and arm of her husband. Held for murder, the near-catatonic Helene refuses to tell anyone--not even Andre's brother Francois (Vincent Price)--why she did it. Francois cannot help but notice that Helene reacts in mortal terror when a tiny flies zips through the room. Nor can he disregard the statement made by Helene's son Philippe (Charles Herbert) that the fly has a curious white head and leg. When Francois pretends that he's captured the fly, Helene relaxes enough to tell her story. It seems that Andre, a scientist, had been working on a matter transmitter, which he claimed could disintegrate matter, then reintegrate it elsewhere. After a few experiments, Andre tried the transmitter himself. Just as he stepped into the disintegration chamber, a fly also flew into the chamber. We aren't immediately shown the results of this, save for the fact that Andre afterward insists upon keeping his head and arm covered. Alone with her husband, Helene abruptly removes the covering, revealing that Andre now bears the head of a fly! His atoms have become mixed up with the fly, and now he is unable to reverse the procedure. Deciding that his transmitter will be a bogy rather than a blessing to mankind, Andre smashes the apparatus and burns his notes. He then instructs Helene, via body language, to crush his fly-like head and arm in the press. Neither Francois nor inspector Charas (Herbert Marshall) believe the story...until, while staring intently at a spider's web in the garden, they see a tiny entrapped fly with Andre's head and arm, tinnily screaming "Help me! Help me!" as the slavering spider approaches (If you're wondering why Vincent Price and Herbert Marshall do not look one another in the eye during this scene, it is because they couldn't deliver their dialogue without dissolving into laughter). Infinitely subtler than the admittedly excellent 1986 remake, the 1958 The Fly is one of the definitive big-budget horror films of its decade. Best bit: the prismatic "fly's eye view" of the screaming Patricia Owens. The Fly was adapted from George Langelaan's short story by James (Shogun) Clavell(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Borrowing liberally from the French film La Totale, this is an action picture, domestic comedy, and political thriller rolled into a crowd-pleasing ball of entertainment. Producer James Cameron wrote and directed the film. Henry Tasker (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a workaholic computer salesman neglecting his mousy wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis), a legal secretary. Simon (Bill Paxton) seduces Helen with the lie that he is a secret agent; he's really a used car salesman. Harry suspects that Helen is cheating on him, and he sends a few colleagues to kidnap them.

    <title lang="en">Extreme Measures</title>
    <desc lang="en">Intelligent thriller about an idealistic young doctor (Hugh Grant) who uncovers a sinister world of illegal medical experiments. Dr Guy Luthan (Grant) is working through another hard shift in the emergency room when he treats a delusional, homeless patient who exhibits wildly erratic and unfamiliar symptoms. To add to the mystery, the man is naked, except for a medical bracelet on his wrist that can only have come from another hospital. Luthan is unable to save the patient, but neither can he forget the unusual circumstances surrounding the man's arrival. He resolves to look into the case further, but when he looks for the autopsy report he finds that it is missing - and so is the body. Unwilling to let the matter drop, despite strong urging from his superiors at the hospital, Luthan continues to search for answers. As this search progresses, he experiences more bad 'luck': his apartment is broken into and he is loses his job. Clearly somebody wants him to stop his investigation. Undeterred, Luthan pursues the truth, and the trail leads to internationally renowned neurologist Dr. Lawrence Myrick (Gene Hackman), acclaimed for his research into regenerating spinal tissue. Myrick's research has the potential to change the world for countless victims of spinal injury - but does this excuse the terrible price being paid by innocent victims?(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Flight of the Phoenix</title>
    <desc lang="en">Based on a novel by Elleston Trevor, director John Moore's The Flight of the Phoenix is a remake of a 1965 film of the same name starring film icon James Stewart. The story revolves around the plight of Captain Frank Towns (Dennis Quaid), a pilot whose C-119 cargo plane full of oil workers could not withstand the violent winds of a desert sandstorm. Stranded in the harsh terrain of Mongolia's Gobi Desert (a departure from the original, in which the plane crashed in the Sahara), Frank and his navigator face an equal challenge in maintaining order among the survivors. The group of oilmen had planned on an uneventful trip to shut off a group of rigs falling below their productivity expectations -- not fending for their very lives. Before long, some men are revealed as cowards, while others exhibit a surprising show of strength, all the while hoping that the wreckage of the original plane can be salvaged before a Lord of the Flies situation occurs. Miranda Otto is featured in a supporting role, as well as Giovanni Ribisi and Tyrese Gibson(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Coraline</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Henry Selick (The Nightmare Before Christmas; James and the Giant Peach) delivers a deliciously dark stop-motion animated adventure for children who don't mind a scare or two, based on Neil Gaiman's much-praised book. Coraline Jones and her parents have just moved into the Pink Palaces Apartments in Oregon, where they find themselves surrounded by eccentric neighbours, including a pair of ageing burlesque performers. It should be an exciting time, but Coraline's parents are too busy working as horticultural journalists to spend any time with her, so she is deeply bored. That is until she discovers a mysterious door that only appears after dark. Bold and inquisitive, the youngster investigates. She discovers a brightly coloured alternative universe, where her 'Other Mother' has plenty of time to play with her and her neighbours' quirks are charmingly exaggerated; in fact, she's tempted to stay. But all is not as it seems: everyone in the new world has buttons for eyes - and the operation to install them involves knitting needles. And that revelation is just the first of her shocking discoveries about the true nature of her apparent idyll... So, there's definitely good reason for that PG certificate, though children who can cope with the story of Hansel and Gretel shouldn't find anything too disturbing here. Selick's film won great critical acclaim, and scooped festival prizes around the world, as well as picking up an Oscar nomination and winning the 2009 BAFTA Children's Award. Also featuring the voices of Keith David, Robert Bailey Jr and Ian McShane(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa</title>
    <desc lang="en">Hopelessly stranded on the remote shores of Madagascar, the New Yorkers hatch a plan to get back to Central Park that instead finds them soaking up sun in the picturesque plains of Africa. Madagascar may be a nice place to visit, but for the gang of animals who spent most of their lives in New York, there is truly no place like home. After discovering the remnants of a crashed airplane, the penguins quickly set about making the repairs needed to get the craft airborne again. When the plane finally takes to the sky, it begins to look like it's only a matter of time before Alex the Lion (voice of Ben Stiller) and friends are soaring over New York Harbor. Unfortunately the penguins weren't the aviation experts they claimed to be, and before long the crew is coming in for a crash-landing in the untamed plains of Africa. Now, as the animals reared in the safety of the zoo come into contact with their decidedly wild counterparts for the very first time, they get a better feel for their roots while marveling over the differences between life in the concrete jungle and life on the world's second largest continent. Of course, while there's plenty to love about wandering the open plains, romantic rivalries and the risk of running into dangerous poachers soon begin to outweigh the joys of some long-overdue family reunions. With some particularly heavy cases of homesickness causing hearts to weigh heavy, the group gradually starts to wonder whether they'll ever find their way back home. Chris Rock, David Schwimmer, Jada Pinkett Smith, Sacha Baron Cohen, Cedric the Entertainer, and Andy Richter lend their voices to this animated sequel that re-teams original Madagascar co-directors Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Coraline</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Henry Selick (The Nightmare Before Christmas; James and the Giant Peach) delivers a deliciously dark stop-motion animated adventure for children who don't mind a scare or two, based on Neil Gaiman's much-praised book. Coraline Jones and her parents have just moved into the Pink Palaces Apartments in Oregon, where they find themselves surrounded by eccentric neighbours, including a pair of ageing burlesque performers. It should be an exciting time, but Coraline's parents are too busy working as horticultural journalists to spend any time with her, so she is deeply bored. That is until she discovers a mysterious door that only appears after dark. Bold and inquisitive, the youngster investigates. She discovers a brightly coloured alternative universe, where her 'Other Mother' has plenty of time to play with her and her neighbours' quirks are charmingly exaggerated; in fact, she's tempted to stay. But all is not as it seems: everyone in the new world has buttons for eyes - and the operation to install them involves knitting needles. And that revelation is just the first of her shocking discoveries about the true nature of her apparent idyll... So, there's definitely good reason for that PG certificate, though children who can cope with the story of Hansel and Gretel shouldn't find anything too disturbing here. Selick's film won great critical acclaim, and scooped festival prizes around the world, as well as picking up an Oscar nomination and winning the 2009 BAFTA Children's Award. Also featuring the voices of Keith David, Robert Bailey Jr and Ian McShane(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa</title>
    <desc lang="en">Hopelessly stranded on the remote shores of Madagascar, the New Yorkers hatch a plan to get back to Central Park that instead finds them soaking up sun in the picturesque plains of Africa. Madagascar may be a nice place to visit, but for the gang of animals who spent most of their lives in New York, there is truly no place like home. After discovering the remnants of a crashed airplane, the penguins quickly set about making the repairs needed to get the craft airborne again. When the plane finally takes to the sky, it begins to look like it's only a matter of time before Alex the Lion (voice of Ben Stiller) and friends are soaring over New York Harbor. Unfortunately the penguins weren't the aviation experts they claimed to be, and before long the crew is coming in for a crash-landing in the untamed plains of Africa. Now, as the animals reared in the safety of the zoo come into contact with their decidedly wild counterparts for the very first time, they get a better feel for their roots while marveling over the differences between life in the concrete jungle and life on the world's second largest continent. Of course, while there's plenty to love about wandering the open plains, romantic rivalries and the risk of running into dangerous poachers soon begin to outweigh the joys of some long-overdue family reunions. With some particularly heavy cases of homesickness causing hearts to weigh heavy, the group gradually starts to wonder whether they'll ever find their way back home. Chris Rock, David Schwimmer, Jada Pinkett Smith, Sacha Baron Cohen, Cedric the Entertainer, and Andy Richter lend their voices to this animated sequel that re-teams original Madagascar co-directors Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath(n)</desc>

Dr. Aaron Lee (Orlando Jones), the school's band director, gives Devon a spot in the marching band's drumline, the heart and soul of a show-style band, but discovers Devon's previous musical education hardly meets his usual standard when he learns that his new drummer can't read music. Devon soon earns a reputation as a stubborn individualist within the band, not necessarily a good thing in an ensemble where a strictly unified performance is considers the ideal. Devon's cocksure attitude and streetwise style doesn't mesh very comfortably with Sean Taylor (Leonard Roberts), a disciplined senior who resents the presence of the upstart freshman in the drumline, and things become even less harmonious when Devon begins making a play for Laila (Zoe Saldana), a beautiful girl who is also being courted by Sean. Songwriter and record producer Dallas Austin, who has worked with Boyz II Men, TLC, and Pink, served as executive producer for Drumline, helped produce the film's musical score, and contributed his own experiences as a marching band member to the screenplay(n)</desc>

This time around, the shoes have passed into the hands of Tucker Bennett (Shaun Johnston), the son of a seriously ill youngster named Charlie (Angus T. Jones. As fate would have it, Charlie is a student of schoolteacher Meghan (Rebecca Gayheart), who is endeavoring to set up a day-care center for single moms in the small town where she lives. At the same time in the same town, young medical resident Nathan Andrews (Neil Patrick Harris), his self-confidence shattered by the death of a teenage patient on the operating table, has returned home to work in the garage owned by his dad Jack (Shaun Johnston). In due course, Nathan meets Meghan and Charlie, and becomes intimately involved in the trials and tribulations of both, leading to an emotional climax in which Nathan must decide whether or not to summon his dormant medical skills to save Charlie's life. Singers NewSong and Blake Shelton appear as themselves, respectively performing the title song and the new composition "Nobody But Me".

    <desc lang="en">When deadly meteorites start striking the calm, peaceful community of Berkeley, Australia, a ragtag group of strangers fight for their lives against a hoard of red-blooded zombies that have mysteriously infected the residents. Headed by the town's ex-beauty queen Rene (Felicity Mason) and the village kook, Marion (Mungo McKay), the clan of survivors battle their way through farmhouses, bomb shelters, and back roads until they are faced with a much bigger problem than just the gut-munchers on their trail. The debut feature of writer/directors Michael and Peter Spierig, the film was two and a half years in the making, echoing other no-budget splatter epics like Peter Jackson's Bad Taste and other similarly themed sci-fi horror romps. It went on to garner accolades from the Melbourne International Film Festival and the Catalonian International Film Festival, Sitges, Spain, among others(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Home.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The importance of homes to animals, not only as a place to live but as a shelter from the elements and a refuge from enemies. A pack of African hunting dogs have made their home on a vast plain in Zambia, but it's far from safe as they must battle hyenas and protect their young. Hermit crabs on a tropical island settle down in empty snail shells - and when a new property washes ashore, they all form a queue, then move up the housing chain until all the shells are taken. On the edge of the Sahara are chimpanzees, whose survival relies on knowing where to find water in the most extreme droughts. Here the elders lead a troop on a brutal trek to a dried-out riverbed to dig wells.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Documentary examining the plants and animals that thrive in monsoon areas, narrated by Colin Salmon. Crested black macaques take advantage of an abundance of fruit, and maleo birds use the sun to incubate their eggs on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. On Java, locals climb volcanoes to offer live sacrifices in thanks for the peaks' help in precipitating rain and fertilising plants with ash. The frequent and heavy rains in Borneo have destroyed the soils, created fierce competition for scarce nutrients, and driven evolution to produce some curious creatures. The Rajah Brooke's pitcher encourages tree shrews to relieve themselves to obtain the substances it needs, while the Bornean red leech is capable of swallowing the giant blue earthworm in one gulp.(n)</desc>

Among its current residents is Jane, a veteran record producer trying to come up with a hit single for a British band whose lead singer Ian happens to be her much younger lover. Jane's son Sam and his fiancée Alex, are both recent graduates of Harvard medical school. Conservative and serious, the couple move to Los Angeles to complete their studies, planning to stay in Jane's home, which she had promised would be vacant. But when they arrive, Sam is distressed to discover Jane and the band still working in Jane's home recording studio. Jane's carefree lifestyle is anathema to Sam, who has devoted his life to being anyone but his mother's son. Sam and Alex grudgingly agree to stay at Jane's house until they can find an alternative place to live. Once in the house, however, Sam and Alex's tight control over their lives begins to unravel. Increasingly, Alex finds herself seduced by Jane and Ian, leaving Sam adrift, vulnerable to the approach of fellow medical resident Sara(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Hotel Rwanda tackles one of the most horrifically ugly events in recent history, when the Hutu extremists of Rwanda initiated a terrifying campaign of genocide, massacring hundreds of thousands of minority Tutsis (who had been given power by the departed Belgian colonists), while the rest of the world looked on and did nothing. Don Cheadle stars as Paul Rusesabagina, the hotel manager at the fancy Les Milles Collines hotel in Kigali. Paul is a Hutu, and a very successful businessman who smoothly greases the wheels, making powerful connections in all strata of Rwandan life. His wife, Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo of Aeon Flux), is a Tutsi. She urges Paul to use his influence to help local Tutsis, who are being harassed and beaten with increasing frequency, but Paul will only use the political capital he's built up to help his own family, if and when they need it. Soon enough, the violence escalates, and the Hutus begin their genocide of the Tutsis. European guests and staff at the hotel are flown out of the country, and Paul is left in charge. He finds that his conscience won't allow him to watch as the innocent are slaughtered, and before long, the hotel has become a well-appointed refugee camp. Paul is seen as a traitor by some, putting his life in danger, and the predicament of his "guests" grows more precarious every day, but despite good intentions on the part of a journalist (Joaquin Phoenix) and a UN peacekeeping colonel (Nick Nolte), the rest of the world is not eager to intervene and stop the massacre. Hotel Rwanda was directed by Irish filmmaker Terry George (Some Mother's Son), who co-wrote the script with Keir Pearson(n)</desc>

Coming home early one afternoon, Victoria West (Phyllis Kirk) is shocked to find her playwright husband Gregory West (Keenan Wynn) in the arms of another woman named Mary (Mary LaRoche). When Victoria demands an explanation, Gregory is forced to reveal that Mary was purely a figment of his imagination, "invented" on the writer's tape recorder. To prove this point, Gregory not only makes Mary re-appear, but also a "huge, red-eyed element." But this is not the only surprise in store for the nonplussed Victoria West. The hilarious finale finds series creator Rod Serling joining in on the festivities(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A World of His Own. The first season Twilight Zone came to a delightful conclusion on July 1, 1960, with this episode, written by Richard Matheson. Coming home early one afternoon, Victoria West (Phyllis Kirk) is shocked to find her playwright husband Gregory West (Keenan Wynn) in the arms of another woman named Mary (Mary LaRoche). When Victoria demands an explanation, Gregory is forced to reveal that Mary was purely a figment of his imagination, "invented" on the writer's tape recorder. To prove this point, Gregory not only makes Mary re-appear, but also a "huge, red-eyed element." But this is not the only surprise in store for the nonplussed Victoria West. The hilarious finale finds series creator Rod Serling joining in on the festivities(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Nervous Man in a $4 Room</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Nervous Man in a $4 Room. Though obviously an episode designed to absorb the costs of the more expensive Twilight Zone installments, this was one of the better efforts of the series' second season, with a tour de force performance by Joe Mantell as penny-ante gangster Jackie Rhoades. Ordered to bump off a rival gangster, the timorous Rhoades tries to summon up the courage for the foul deed, only to be thwarted at every turn by his own conscience -- who as it turns out has more "guts" than Jackie ever dreamed of. Though essentially a solo endeavor, the episode also features a good performance from future producer-director William D. Gordon as Jackie's nasty boss, while another future director, Brian G. Hutton, serves as Joe Mantell's back-to-camera stand-in when the actor "confronts" himself. Written by Rod Serling and scored by Jerry Goldsmith, "Nervous Man in a Four Dollar Room" was the first episode produced for Twilight Zone's second season, even though it was telecast as the third episode, on October 14, 1960(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Donald P Borchers' remake of the supernatural horror, based on a short story by Stephen King, and starring David Anders, Kandyse McClure and Daniel Newman. Back in 1963 a dreadful drought hit Nebraska, and it had a devastating effect on one small, isolated town. Out in the parched fields, one of the community's children had a fire-and-brimstone dream in which it was revealed by an entity called He Who Walks Behind the Rows that the blight was due to the erroneous ways of the adults. The solution was simple: everyone over the age of 18 must die; and so the children slaughtered the town's adult population. From that point on, everyone would be ritually sacrificed upon reaching their 19th birthday to appease He Who Walks... Now, 12 years on, Burton and VIcky Stanton have the misfortune of stumbling upon the ill-fated outpost. Will they make it out alive - or are they destined to come to the same gory end as the others?(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace</title>
    <desc lang="en">In 1977, George Lucas released Star Wars, the ultimate sci-fi popcorn flick-turned-pop-culture myth machine. It quickly became the biggest money-making film of all time and changed the shape of the film industry. After two successful sequels (1980's The Empire Strikes Back and 1983's Return of the Jedi) that extended the story of the first film, Lucas took some time off to produce movies for others, with mixed success. In 1999, Lucas returned to the Star Wars saga with a new approach -- instead of picking up where Return of the Jedi left off, Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace would be the first of a trilogy of stories to trace what happened in the intergalactic saga before the first film began. Here, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) is a young apprentice Jedi knight under the tutelage of Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson); Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), who will later father Luke Skywalker and become known as Darth Vader, is just a nine-year-old boy. When the Trade Federation cuts off all routes to the planet Naboo, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan are assigned to settle the matter, but when they arrive on Naboo they are brought to Amidala (Natalie Portman), the Naboo queen, by a friendly but opportunistic Gungan named Jar Jar. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan plan to escort Amidala to a meeting of Republic leaders in Coruscant, but trouble with their spacecraft strands them on the planet Tatooine, where Qui-Gon meets Anakin, the slave of a scrap dealer. Qui-Gon is soon convinced that the boy could be the leader the Jedis have been searching for, and he begins bargaining for his freedom and teaching the boy the lessons of the Force. The supporting cast includes Pernilla August as Anakin's mother, Terence Stamp as Chancellor Valorum, and Samuel L. Jackson as Jedi master Mace Windu. Jackson told a reporter before The Phantom Menace's release that the best part about doing the film was that he got to say "May the Force be with you" onscreen(n)</desc>

Keanu Reeves stars as Klaatu, an alien sent by a confederation of extraterrestrial beings to warn the inhabitants of Earth that the biosphere is on the verge of collapse. Predictably, as soon as he emerges from his spaceship a trigger-happy soldier ignores his instructions and takes a shot at the visitor. The wounded Klaatu asks for access to the United Nations to deliver his message, but the Secretary of Defence, Regina Jackson, instead orders that he should be taken away for further investigations. Klaatu becomes increasingly convinced that Earth can only survive if mankind is eradicated..(n)</desc>
