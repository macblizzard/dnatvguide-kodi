Steve Lopez (Robert Downey Jr.) is a disenchanted journalist stuck in a dead-end job. His marriage to a fellow journalist having recently come to an end, Steve is wandering through Los Angeles' Skid Row when he notices a bedraggled figure playing a two-stringed violin. The figure in question is Ayers (Jamie Foxx), a man whose promising career in music was cut short due to a debilitating bout with mental illness. The more Lopez learns about Ayers, the greater his respect grows for the troubled soul. How could a man with such remarkable talent wind up living on the streets, and not be performing on-stage with a symphony orchestra? Later, as Lopez embarks on a quixotic quest to help Ayers pull his life together and launch a career in music, he gradually comes to realize that it is not Ayers whose life is being transformed, but his own(n)</desc>

Unable to persuade Hank's former police department superiors that they're onto a huge case, the two partners must devise a way to expose the sophisticated scam and bring down Nash on their own.

He lives a comfortable life in a small town, where his main source of entertainment is stopping by the local diner to flirt with pretty waitress Muriel (Karen Young).

Tom isn't long for this earth, and before he goes he seeks forgiveness from David Kagan, a fellow crewman that he and Harry knew from their Navy days. Unable to say no to an old friend, Harry sets out on a reluctant search for David, visiting old friends and drudging up painful memories in the process.

    <title lang="en">Daredevil</title>
    <desc lang="en">Mark Steven Johnson's violent superhero fantasy-morality play stars Ben Affleck as Matt Murdock, a guilt-wracked blind vigilante with a penchant for red leather. During his childhood, an accident involving toxic waste blinded Murdock, but it also enhanced his other senses and gave him a kind of 'radar vision'. The incident was partially caused by his discovery that his father was involved with the Mob. Now, the adult Murdock, spurred partly by Catholic guilt over his role in his father's death, has dedicated this life to fighting crime and protecting the innocent. By day Murdock's a defence lawyer, but by night he dispenses summary justice to criminals who've escaped the courts. Things get complicated when he falls in love with Elektra Natchios. Not only is she the daughter of a man with connections to New York crime bosses but, unknown to Murdock, she's also a vigilante who's equally keen on figure-hugging leather (black in her case). And when Daredevil is framed for the murder of her father, Elektra swears vengeance on the masked crime-fighter (not realising that he's her lover). Meanwhile, both of them are in mortal danger from the actual killer, a merciless Irish assassin called Bullseye(n)</desc>

Having met once before on a traffic stop, the two men are less than thrilled to be paired together as security guards. When the two men discover a complex smuggling scheme, however, they put aside their animosity to investigate the criminal scheme. They soon learn that the illegal enterprise involves a mastermind named Nash (Eric Roberts) and a new, virtually indestructible metal that's worth a fortune. Unable to persuade Hank's former police department superiors that they're onto a huge case, the two partners must devise a way to expose the sophisticated scam and bring down Nash on their own. National Security co-stars Colm Feore, Bill Duke, Timothy Busfield, and Wayne Knight(n)</desc>

The painting is currently owned by a Gloucestershire businessman and seems to have all the hallmarks of Constable's early sketches, as well as clear signs that it depicts the same location as The Hay Wain - but was dismissed as another artist's work 30 years previously. The case proves particularly personal for Philip, who is one of the artwork's previous owners.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Hidden Histories: WWI's Forgotten Photographs</title>
    <desc lang="en">The story of soldiers' photography during the First World War. Some British and German troops marched into battle with secret vest pocket cameras in the hope of recording what they believed would be a great adventure, however few were prepared for the horrors they would witness. The photos, many of which have never been seen in public before, provide an account of their lives in the trenches and their rapid loss of innocence, and the programme follows their relatives as they search for the secrets hidden in their ancestors' images.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Hosted--or rather, refereed--by boxing expert Max Kellerman, this lively cable-TV discussion show featured four sports columnists, each from a different part of the USA, discussing recent pro-athletic developments in a sort of electronic summit meeting. Kellerman determined how much time each of the columnists would be permitted to express his or her opinions--and he was harsh indeed, frequently limiting the discourse to ten seconds or less. At the end of the show, Kellerman would award points for the most cogent opinions and arguments, and also subtract points from contributors whom he determined had not effectively expressed themselves. The inagural episode of ESPN's Around the Horn was seen on September 30, 2002(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Around the Horn</title>
    <desc lang="en">Hosted--or rather, refereed--by boxing expert Max Kellerman, this lively cable-TV discussion show featured four sports columnists, each from a different part of the USA, discussing recent pro-athletic developments in a sort of electronic summit meeting. Kellerman determined how much time each of the columnists would be permitted to express his or her opinions--and he was harsh indeed, frequently limiting the discourse to ten seconds or less. At the end of the show, Kellerman would award points for the most cogent opinions and arguments, and also subtract points from contributors whom he determined had not effectively expressed themselves. The inagural episode of ESPN's Around the Horn was seen on September 30, 2002(n)</desc>

On the 71/2th floor of an office block, John Cusack discovers a door that's a portal into John Malkovich's head for 15 minutes (before you're spat out on the New Jersey Turnpike). He and fellow worker Catherine Keener start selling tickets, much to the bemusement of Malkovich, who finds himself regularly invaded. Matters become complicated when Cusack's wife (Cameron Diaz) gets involved and what was a partnership becomes a ménage-a-trois (or quatre, including Malkovich).

    <desc lang="en">As World War I rages in Europe and Allied forces in France, Italy, and England find their resolve quickly diminishing due to the overwhelming force of the German juggernaut, a handful of brave American soldiers volunteer to join their French counterparts in learning to fly and fighting for freedom from above as the true story of the legendary Lafayette Escadrille comes to the screen in a breathtaking war adventure from Academy Award-winning director Tony Bill and famed producer Dean Devlin. They have come from all over the United States, ready and willing to put their lives on the line despite their country's initial pledge to not get involved with the all-consuming war that rages throughout Europe. Few could have foreseen the challenges faced by the world's first fighter pilots, however, and upon arriving at their aerodrome in France, the aspiring aviators are assigned to a new squadron under the command of war-ravaged Captain Thenault (Jean Reno) and battle-weary American pilot Reed Cassidy -- the sole survivor of his devastated former air brigade. With little encouragement from their fellow aviators and nothing to drive but their unifying goal of taking to the skies and offering up their lives in the name of freedom, the determined airmen of the Lafayette Escadrille set out to make history by embarking on the adventure of a lifetime. James Franco, Martin Henderson, and David Ellison star in a script penned by Phil Sears, Blake T. Evans, and David S. Ward(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The mysterious fifth element when combined with four others creates the ultimate weapon against universal evil. The story begins in 1914 when benign aliens visit an ancient Egyptian temple to steal four stones containing information about this mysterious element. The visitors promise to return to Earth in the future to save it from evil. Three centuries pass and Earth is threatened by a thunderous Cosmic Evil. Unfortunately, the Evil killed the Good aliens who promised to save the planet. Fortunately, Earthlings have a piece of one of the alien saviors. Utilizing DNA restructuring, scientists grow the piece into a perfect new alien which takes the form of a curvaceous, seductive no-holds barred redheaded acrobat who escapes from the lab with the police in hot pursuit. Desperately she dives into a cab reluctantly driven by luckless former special force officer (Bruce Willis) who suddenly finds himself faced with the task of saving the universe by finding the missing stones and vanquishing the evil forces. Featuring dazzling special effects and classy production values coupled with a healthy splash of outlandish high fashion the emphasis of Besson's film is not so much plot as it is over-the top spectacle(n)</desc>

A trip to the Springfield Family Fun Center proves to be a lucky one for successful bully Nelson Muntz (voice of Nancy Cartwright) when he wins a brand new BB gun, and Bart Simpson (also voiced by Cartwright), suitably impressed, asks if he can come over some time and try it out. Bart's mother Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) is aware of Nelson's thuggish tendencies and doesn't care for guns, so she forbids Bart to spend time with Nelson. Bart stops by his house after school anyway, and while trying out the gun accidentally kills a bird. Marge arrives just in time to see Bart in action, and rather than yell at her boy, she tells him she's given up on him. Bart senses he's finally crossed a dangerous line, and when he sees several unhatched eggs in the late bird's nest, he takes the back to his tree house in order to hatch them. While Bart tries to keep the egg-hatching project a secret, when Marge finds out it gives her a new faith in her son. However, when the eggs finally hatch, to the surprise of everyone what emerges aren't birds but Bolivian Tree Lizards, which have been declared a menace to wildlife by the U.S. Wildlife Department. "Bart The Mother" featured a voice cameo from Phil Hartman as Troy McClure in what proved to be his final appearance on the show; the episode first aired on September 27, 1998(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Another chance to see the 2012 contest, as presenters Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins invite 12 enthusiastic bakers to take part in a contest to determine which of them is Britain's best amateur, facing challenges devised by judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood. To begin with, they tackle an upside down cake, before following Paul's recipe for rum babas, a hybrid of cake and enriched dough that baffles some of the competitors. Finally, they are challenged to produce a show-stopping cake that reveals a hidden design when sliced into. Who will be first to leave?.(n)</desc>

The hopefuls then tackle a demanding technical challenge as they try to replicate Paul's recipe for an eight-strand plaited loaf, before receiving the dubious honour of becoming the first contestants in the show's history to make bagels. At the end of the day, Paul and Mary must decide who is this round's Star Baker - and who will be going home. Presented by Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins. From 2012.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The 10 remaining amateur cooks' tart-making abilities are put to the test in the third round of the competition. Their first task is to bake a tarte Tatin, with judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry looking for intriguing flavour combinations to tickle their tastebuds. The hopefuls then face another daunting technical challenge as they try to replicate Mary's seemingly straightforward recipe for treacle tart, but the delicate task of adding a lattice top leaves some contestants flummoxed. Finally, they try to create an ornate fruit tart fit for gracing the window display of a leading patisserie - before discovering the identities of the latest Star Baker and the person who will be heading home.

The hopefuls start by creating tortes before tackling this week's technical test - the delicate French dish of creme caramel. Though these two rounds provide a stern examination of the amateurs' creative flair and technical ability, they then face possibly the toughest task of the series so far - a six-hour challenge to create a show-stopping layered meringue. Once the sugar has set, who will be this week's Star Baker, and who will be going home? Presented by Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins. From 2012.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Four bakers remain in the hunt for the title of Britain's best amateur baker, but they all need to raise their game when they tackle a trio of classic patisserie confections in the semi-final. A petits fours-making challenge provides an early test of nerves, before the quartet face the toughest technical task in the show's history - creating a fraisier, a sponge cake filled with mousse and strawberries. As tempers rise and confidence falters, the contestants have one last chance to impress judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry by baking a showstopping choux gateau - before discovering who has earned a place in the 2012 final.

    <desc lang="en">Another chance to see the 2012 contest, as presenters Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins invite 12 enthusiastic bakers to take part in a contest to determine which of them is Britain's best amateur, facing challenges devised by judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood. To begin with, they tackle an upside down cake, before following Paul's recipe for rum babas, a hybrid of cake and enriched dough that baffles some of the competitors. Finally, they are challenged to produce a show-stopping cake that reveals a hidden design when sliced into. Who will be first to leave?.(n)</desc>

The hopefuls then tackle a demanding technical challenge as they try to replicate Paul's recipe for an eight-strand plaited loaf, before receiving the dubious honour of becoming the first contestants in the show's history to make bagels.

    <desc lang="en">The 10 remaining amateur cooks' tart-making abilities are put to the test in the third round of the competition. Their first task is to bake a tarte Tatin, with judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry looking for intriguing flavour combinations to tickle their tastebuds. The hopefuls then face another daunting technical challenge as they try to replicate Mary's seemingly straightforward recipe for treacle tart, but the delicate task of adding a lattice top leaves some contestants flummoxed. Finally, they try to create an ornate fruit tart fit for gracing the window display of a leading patisserie - before discovering the identities of the latest Star Baker and the person who will be heading home.

The hopefuls start by creating tortes before tackling this week's technical test - the delicate French dish of creme caramel. Though these two rounds provide a stern examination of the amateurs' creative flair and technical ability, they then face possibly the toughest task of the series so far - a six-hour challenge to create a show-stopping layered meringue. Once the sugar has set, who will be this week's Star Baker, and who will be going home? Presented by Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins. From 2012.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Underworld hipster Chili Palmer is back in the entertainment business in this sequel to the 1995 hit Get Shorty, which like the first film is based on a novel by Elmore Leonard. Gangster-turned-movie producer Chili (once again played by John Travolta) has grown tired of the screen trade, especially after his latest project turned out to be a box-office flop. Chili is looking for new horizons and thinks he may have found his niche when his close friend Tommy Athens (James Woods), a fellow mobster who runs an independent record label, is murdered by Russian gangsters. Chili takes over Athens' record company, Nothing to Lose Records, and begins courting Tommy's girlfriend, Edie (Uma Thurman). Edie is an experienced hand in record production, and together she and Chili spot what would seem to be the ideal act for their label -- Linda Moon (Christina Milian), a beautiful young woman with a powerhouse voice. Linda is stuck, however, in a going-nowhere R&amp;B trio managed by the monumentally sleazy Raji (Vince Vaughn). Chili isn't much concerned about Linda's contract with Raji, but Raji certainly is, and the manager soon takes out a contract on Chili with the same Russian hoods who killed Tommy. Soon Chili is facing all the action he can handle between the Russian gunmen, a music mogul named Nick Carr (Harvey Keitel) who wants Chili to stay out of the business, and Sin LaSalle (Cedric the Entertainer), a successful hip-hop producer who wants Chili to pay him the 300,000 dollars he is owed by Tommy. Be Cool also features appearances by The Rock as a gay Samoan bodyguard, Andre Benjamin (aka Andre 3000 from the hip-hop duo Outkast) as a rapper who isn't very good with a gun, and Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler as himself(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Michael</title>
    <desc lang="en">Traditionally, angels are supposed to have snowy wings, spotless flowing robes and be bathed in heavenly light, but not Michael (John Travolta). With a hairy pot belly, long hair, a cigarette addiction, an insatiable sugar craving and filthy wings, the archangel Michael is anything but angelic looking. His unkempt appearance and the fact that he is found holed up in a ramshackle boarding house in a beat-up Iowa backwater, makes it even harder to believe that he is anything but a bum. Still when the publisher of the National Mirror, the country's top tabloid learns there may be an angel afoot, he sends three reporters out to cover the story. Slightly embittered writer Frank Quinlan (William Hurt) hopes the story will bust him out of his slump. Hapless photographer Huey (Robert Pastorelli) worries that one more botched job will cause publisher Vartan Malt (Bob Hoskins) to take away his one lucrative gig shooting celebrity wonder-dog Sparky. The enigmatic Dorothy (Andie MacDowell) is supposedly an expert on all things angelic. Together the disparate trio travel to Iowa and meet Pansy Millbank (Jean Stapleton) the aged owner of a run-down rooming house who tells them how Michael miraculously saved her from financial ruin. In return, she allows him to stay at her place. Naturally, the reporters want to meet this phenomenon, but they are ill-prepared at what groggily stumps down the stairs to greet them. From the stubble-faced, boxer-short wearing, smouldering mess before them, they learn that all high-ranking angels are allowed 26 Earthly vacations for all eternity. This is Michael's final vacation and he wants to have fun. The reporters only want to get as much publicity as they can from their ethereal visitor and so set off with him to Chicago. Along the way, they have many funny misadventures(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Enough</title>
    <desc lang="en">Screenwriter Nicholas Kazan and director Michael Apted combine elements of the hit films Sleeping With the Enemy and Double Jeopardy in this domestic thriller starring actress and recording artist Jennifer Lopez. "J. Lo" stars as Slim, a working-class diner waitress who accepts a date with the dashing Mitch (Bill Campbell), a successful building contractor who warns her about the insincere attentions of another suitor. Swept off her feet by Mitch, Slim soon marries him and gives birth to a daughter, Gracie (Tessa Allen). Her new life of suburban privilege seems idyllic for a few years until Slim discovers that Mitch is a serial philanderer. After his abuse becomes physical, Slim first seeks refuge with a battered woman's group then creates a new identity in another city, but she soon learns that there is no hiding from the resourceful Mitch, who is always able to track her down. After receiving little help from the father (Fred Ward), who abandoned her years ago, or the unsympathetic legal system, Slim resorts to martial arts lessons and a calculated campaign of payback designed to rid her and Gracie of the violent Mitch's presence forever. Enough co-stars Juliette Lewis, Noah Wyle, and Dan Futterman(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Underworld hipster Chili Palmer is back in the entertainment business in this sequel to the 1995 hit Get Shorty, which like the first film is based on a novel by Elmore Leonard. Gangster-turned-movie producer Chili (once again played by John Travolta) has grown tired of the screen trade, especially after his latest project turned out to be a box-office flop. Chili is looking for new horizons and thinks he may have found his niche when his close friend Tommy Athens (James Woods), a fellow mobster who runs an independent record label, is murdered by Russian gangsters. Chili takes over Athens' record company, Nothing to Lose Records, and begins courting Tommy's girlfriend, Edie (Uma Thurman). Edie is an experienced hand in record production, and together she and Chili spot what would seem to be the ideal act for their label -- Linda Moon (Christina Milian), a beautiful young woman with a powerhouse voice. Linda is stuck, however, in a going-nowhere R&amp;B trio managed by the monumentally sleazy Raji (Vince Vaughn). Chili isn't much concerned about Linda's contract with Raji, but Raji certainly is, and the manager soon takes out a contract on Chili with the same Russian hoods who killed Tommy. Soon Chili is facing all the action he can handle between the Russian gunmen, a music mogul named Nick Carr (Harvey Keitel) who wants Chili to stay out of the business, and Sin LaSalle (Cedric the Entertainer), a successful hip-hop producer who wants Chili to pay him the 300,000 dollars he is owed by Tommy. Be Cool also features appearances by The Rock as a gay Samoan bodyguard, Andre Benjamin (aka Andre 3000 from the hip-hop duo Outkast) as a rapper who isn't very good with a gun, and Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler as himself(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Traditionally, angels are supposed to have snowy wings, spotless flowing robes and be bathed in heavenly light, but not Michael (John Travolta). With a hairy pot belly, long hair, a cigarette addiction, an insatiable sugar craving and filthy wings, the archangel Michael is anything but angelic looking. His unkempt appearance and the fact that he is found holed up in a ramshackle boarding house in a beat-up Iowa backwater, makes it even harder to believe that he is anything but a bum. Still when the publisher of the National Mirror, the country's top tabloid learns there may be an angel afoot, he sends three reporters out to cover the story. Slightly embittered writer Frank Quinlan (William Hurt) hopes the story will bust him out of his slump. Hapless photographer Huey (Robert Pastorelli) worries that one more botched job will cause publisher Vartan Malt (Bob Hoskins) to take away his one lucrative gig shooting celebrity wonder-dog Sparky. The enigmatic Dorothy (Andie MacDowell) is supposedly an expert on all things angelic. Together the disparate trio travel to Iowa and meet Pansy Millbank (Jean Stapleton) the aged owner of a run-down rooming house who tells them how Michael miraculously saved her from financial ruin. In return, she allows him to stay at her place. Naturally, the reporters want to meet this phenomenon, but they are ill-prepared at what groggily stumps down the stairs to greet them. From the stubble-faced, boxer-short wearing, smouldering mess before them, they learn that all high-ranking angels are allowed 26 Earthly vacations for all eternity. This is Michael's final vacation and he wants to have fun. The reporters only want to get as much publicity as they can from their ethereal visitor and so set off with him to Chicago. Along the way, they have many funny misadventures(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Enough</title>
    <desc lang="en">Screenwriter Nicholas Kazan and director Michael Apted combine elements of the hit films Sleeping With the Enemy and Double Jeopardy in this domestic thriller starring actress and recording artist Jennifer Lopez. "J. Lo" stars as Slim, a working-class diner waitress who accepts a date with the dashing Mitch (Bill Campbell), a successful building contractor who warns her about the insincere attentions of another suitor. Swept off her feet by Mitch, Slim soon marries him and gives birth to a daughter, Gracie (Tessa Allen). Her new life of suburban privilege seems idyllic for a few years until Slim discovers that Mitch is a serial philanderer. After his abuse becomes physical, Slim first seeks refuge with a battered woman's group then creates a new identity in another city, but she soon learns that there is no hiding from the resourceful Mitch, who is always able to track her down. After receiving little help from the father (Fred Ward), who abandoned her years ago, or the unsympathetic legal system, Slim resorts to martial arts lessons and a calculated campaign of payback designed to rid her and Gracie of the violent Mitch's presence forever. Enough co-stars Juliette Lewis, Noah Wyle, and Dan Futterman(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Anne Hathaway and Julie Andrews star in Garry Marshall's family comedy about an ordinary girl who suddenly finds out that she is, in fact, a princess. Mia Thermopolis is a pleasant, if slightly awkward and geeky, 15-year-old high school student living in San Francisco. She's not the most popular pupil at school, and is regularly picked on by the cheerleader clique. However, all that could be about to change: after her estranged father dies, it's discovered that she's directly in line to the throne of a tiny European country. But first she must show she has the bearing and beauty necessary for the role - and her grandmother Queen Clarisse Renaldi's first impressions are far from positive. Can Mia prove her regal relative wrong?(n)</desc>

For years, Bruce (Edward Norton) has been living in the shadows, pursued by the military and haunted by the rage within. But traveling the world in secrecy isn't easy, and as hard as he tries Bruce can't get Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) off his mind. The daughter of Bruce's nemesis Gen. Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross (William Hurt), Betty represents everything that is beautiful in the world to a man who lives his life on the run. Eventually, Bruce returns to civilization and faces the wrath of The Abomination. While the Hulk may be a formidable force of nature, The Abomination is decidedly more powerful, and determined to destroy Bruce Banner. Created when KGB agent Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) exposed himself to a higher dose of the same radiation that transformed Bruce into The Hulk, The Abomination is unable to change back into human form and holds Bruce accountable for his frightful condition. With time fast running out for both Bruce and The Hulk, New York City is about to become the ultimate urban battle zone as two of the most powerful creatures ever to walk the earth clash in a massive, no-holds-barred fight to the finish(n)</desc>

On her latest mission, Barb has captured a rebel fugitive, Krebs, who possesses special contact lenses that can defeat the retinal scanners the CD uses to prevent people from defecting to Canada. The evil regime wants those lenses before Krebs can pass them to Cora, D a former government physician who plans to use them to save thousands of lives..

    <title lang="en">Pet Sematary</title>
    <desc lang="en">A doctor dabbles in magical resurrection with horrific consequences in this supernatural thriller adapted from the novel by Stephen King. When Dr. Louis Creed (Dale Midkiff) and his family move from Chicago to an old farmhouse in rural Maine, their only concern is the busy highway that flanks their new home. Louis' family -- wife Rachel (Denise Crosby), daughter Ellie (Blaze Berdahl), and toddler Gage (Miko Hughes) -- soon meet kindly old duffer Jud Crandall (Fred Gwynne), who introduces them all to the local attractions, including a pet cemetary built on the remains of a Native American burial ground. When Rachel and the kids head off to visit Louis' in-laws, Ellie's cat gets flattened by a truck. Jud counsels Louis to bury it in the old Indian portion of the cemetary; the next day, it returns from the dead, carrying with it the stink of the earth and a decidedly bad attitude. Shortly thereafter, Louis is tempted to use the cemetary's magical powers again when his son suffers a tragic accident. A snarling kitty, it turns out, is nothing compared to the horror of a little boy with no soul and a taste for scalpels. In addition to adapting his own novel for the screen, writer King appeared in a brief cameo as the minister presiding over Gage's funeral. Director Mary Lambert would return with Pet Sematary Two(n)</desc>

The film opens in 1954 as World War II veteran and current federal marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his new partner, Chuck (Mark Ruffalo), ferry to Shutter Island, a water-bound mental hospital housing the criminally insane. They have been asked to investigate the disappearance of Rachel Solando (Emily Mortimer), a patient admitted to the asylum after she murdered her three children. As Teddy quizzes Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley), the head of the institution, he begins to suspect that the authorities in charge might not be giving him the whole truth, and that a terrible fate may befall all the patients in the spooky Ward C -- a unit devoted to the most heinous of the hospital's inmates. Complicating matters further, Teddy has a secret of his own -- the arsonist who murdered his wife is incarcerated on Shutter Island. Driven to confront his wife's killer, and stranded on the island because of a hurricane, Teddy must unravel the secrets of the eerie place before succumbing to his own madness.

    <desc lang="en">Swamp Shootout. The Seminole Tribe of Florida has taken over management of Billie Swamp Safari, and for incoming Director Brian Zepeda, it's an opportunity to educate the public about the tribe's long history living in the Everglades. Brian's first project will be one of the region's biggest Native American cultural events: The Seminole Shoot-out, a war re-enactment. As Operations Manager, Jay Osceola is responsible for ensuring the well-being of the park's animals and guests. It's up to him to keep the park running in spite of a drought that has left water levels dangerously low. Jay's younger brother Everett has also joined the staff to handle alligators - though he's never confronted a live gator face-to-face. Lesson #1 will be surviving his first class, which includes catching a gator in the swamp. While the young Swamp Men on Billie Swamp staff are still in training, The Seminole Tribe's Wildlife Officers arrive to keep the peace and manage the reptile population. 'Cattail' and 'One Bear' have decades of experience in the Everglades, but even they are tested when nuisance alligators turn up next to a housing development, and the toughest gator at Safari threatens to eat his own offspring(n)</desc>

Tribe wildlife officers, 'Onebear' Batista and Jonathan 'Cattail' Vazquez, are determined to remove the clever gator, even if it means going to unexpected extremes. Meanwhile, Billie Swamp Safari prepares the grounds and staff for their first ever Arbor Day celebration. Park Director Brian Zepeda puts his tour guides to the test, setting up a difficult swamp buggy driving course, finding out which driver is the best and who needs more work. Just days before the celebration begins, an employee is attacked by bees near a guest hut. Brian quickly calls in a bee wrangler hoping to remove the unwanted guests before the real guests check in. Across the park, employees Rey and Tatika notice that a rehabilitated hawk has returned looking for food. Assuming the hawk must be caring for young, Rey tracks down the nest, only to discover what looks like a baby hawk that isn't breathing. While Rey moves in for a closer look, One Bear and Cattail come to the park to release three captive-born, baby green-backed herons(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Nick Knowles and his crack team of builders, plasterers and electricians come to the aid of Frank and Christine Burrows in Wigan, Greater Manchester. In 2012, the Burrows' 35-year-old son Mark retrained as a scaffolder to follow in his father's footsteps, but was paralysed as the result of an unprovoked attack that left him with severe brain damage. Mark now needs constant care, but the Burrows' family home is not yet fit for purpose, so Frank and Christine have been forced to take their son to a care home 15 miles away. With the help of flamboyant designer Laurence Llewelyn Bowen, Nick's experts set about constructing a self-contained apartment alongside the Burrows' two-bedroom bungalow, which will provide Mark with the space, independence and security he will need to return home for good after spending two years away.(n)</desc>

To begin with, they tackle an upside down cake, before following Paul's recipe for rum babas, a hybrid of cake and enriched dough that baffles some of the competitors. Finally, they are challenged to produce a show-stopping cake that reveals a hidden design when sliced into. Who will be first to leave?.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Tyler Perry's Meet the Browns</title>
    <desc lang="en">Prolific playwright Tyler Perry adapts his popular stage play of the same name in this family-oriented comedy concerning a desperate mother who connects with the family she never knew. Brenda is a single Chicago mother of three who has been struggling for years to keep her kids off of the streets. Suddenly let go from her job with no warning to speak of, the eternally optimistic mother begins to experience a suffocating sense of hopelessness for the very first time in her life. When Brenda receives a death notice claiming that the father she has never met has passed away, she quickly gathers up the kids and sets out for Georgia to attend the funeral. Upon arriving in the Deep South, the once fretful mother is pleasantly surprised to discover that there is a whole side of the family she never knew existed. A crass but good-natured clan that welcomes Brenda and her children with open arms, the Browns' lazy summer afternoons and frequent trips to the county fair offer a much-needed contrast to the stress of surviving in inner city Chicago. Writer/director/actor Perry reprises his role as indomitable, law-breaking grandmother Madea in a comedy that proves sometimes second chances come when you least expect it(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Tyler Perry's Meet the Browns</title>
    <desc lang="en">Prolific playwright Tyler Perry adapts his popular stage play of the same name in this family-oriented comedy concerning a desperate mother who connects with the family she never knew. Brenda is a single Chicago mother of three who has been struggling for years to keep her kids off of the streets. Suddenly let go from her job with no warning to speak of, the eternally optimistic mother begins to experience a suffocating sense of hopelessness for the very first time in her life. When Brenda receives a death notice claiming that the father she has never met has passed away, she quickly gathers up the kids and sets out for Georgia to attend the funeral. Upon arriving in the Deep South, the once fretful mother is pleasantly surprised to discover that there is a whole side of the family she never knew existed. A crass but good-natured clan that welcomes Brenda and her children with open arms, the Browns' lazy summer afternoons and frequent trips to the county fair offer a much-needed contrast to the stress of surviving in inner city Chicago. Writer/director/actor Perry reprises his role as indomitable, law-breaking grandmother Madea in a comedy that proves sometimes second chances come when you least expect it(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A lawman fed up with the corruption in Apartheid-era South Africa takes to robbing banks in this gritty crime drama from writer/director Bronwen Hughes. The title Stander refers to Andre Stander (Thomas Jane), an ambitious second-generation policeman whose strategies and experience make him the perfect candidate for commander. But when the privileged Stander is chosen to direct the police force against a brutal, majority-led uprising in Soweto, he becomes so disgusted with his actions that he decides to undermine his own authority as an officer. His means for doing so is to moonlight as a bank robber, partly out of disgust for the force and partly as an adrenalin-fueled act of deception. After pulling more than two dozen heists, Stander is caught -- but it isn't long before he breaks out of jail, and fortified by two hardened-criminal pals, Lee (Dexter Fletcher) and Allan (David Patrick O'Hara), he resumes his anti-authoritarian crime sprees. Stander premiered at the 2003 Toronto Film Festival(n)</desc>

Earl Brooks (Costner) is a successful businessman, noted philanthropist, and loving father. He's the kind of man whom no one would ever suspect of being a notorious serial killer, but then again history's most dubious psychopaths are often the quiet neighbor whom no one would ever suspect was capable of committing such unspeakable atrocities. Until now, no one has had any reason to link Earl Brooks with the heinous crimes of the dreaded Thumbprint Killer. Even his beautiful wife (Marg Helgenbeger) and teenage daughter (Danielle Panabaker) could never conceive of such an awful truth. But when Mr. Brooks's dark side begins to outshine his sane exterior, an amateur photographer (Dane Cook) captures the killer succumbing to his murderous instinct on film. Now, as Mr. Brooks is pursued by tenacious detective Tracy Atwood (Moore) and forced to bend to the will of an opportunistic bystander, the killer who was once able to keep his murderous alter ego (Hurt) in check finds his control steadily slipping(n)</desc>

Their self-assured exterior masks a creeping frustration at their inability to feel fulfilled in their relationships or careers. Frank is mired in a well-paying but boring office job, and April is a housewife still mourning the demise of her hoped-for acting career. Determined to identify themselves as superior to the mediocre sprawl of suburbanites who surround them, they decide to move to France where they will be better able to develop their true artistic sensibilities, free of the consumerist demands of capitalist America. But as their relationship deteriorates into an endless cycle of squabbling, jealousy and recriminations, their trip and their dreams of self-fulfilment are thrown into jeopardy.Dir: Sam Mendes.

Drebin foils a plot by arch-criminal Victor Ludwig to assassinate our own dear Queen at a Los Angeles Dodgers baseball game. He's helped by Ludwig's assistant Jane Spencer who has no idea of the dastardly plan and soon agrees to help Drebin, as well as falling in love with him. The plot is paper-thin but the laughs come hot on the heels of each other, made all the funnier by the straight playing of all the leads. Cameo appearances include the late John Houseman and baseball legend Reggie Jackson(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Revolutionary Road</title>
    <desc lang="en">Drama based on Richard Yates's acclaimed novel, reuniting the Titanic stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. April and Frank Wheeler are a young, thriving couple living with their two children in a Connecticut suburb in the mid-1950s. Their self-assured exterior masks a creeping frustration at their inability to feel fulfilled in their relationships or careers. Frank is mired in a well-paying but boring office job, and April is a housewife still mourning the demise of her hoped-for acting career. Determined to identify themselves as superior to the mediocre sprawl of suburbanites who surround them, they decide to move to France where they will be better able to develop their true artistic sensibilities, free of the consumerist demands of capitalist America. But as their relationship deteriorates into an endless cycle of squabbling, jealousy and recriminations, their trip and their dreams of self-fulfilment are thrown into jeopardy.Dir: Sam Mendes.

    <title lang="en">The Mexican</title>
    <desc lang="en">Academy award nominated megastar Brad Pitt stars alongside Academy Award winning beauty Julia Roberts in this fun-filled romantic comedy packed with adventure. A clumsy criminal is put in a position where he not only has to save his own skin, but that of his girlfriend in this comedy with strong undercurrents of romance. Jerry Welbach (Pitt) is a low-level Mafia "mechanic" whose ineptitude is countered by frequent (but unpredictable) bursts of dumb luck.

    <title lang="en">Waking Life</title>
    <desc lang="en">From director Richard Linklater, who created the independent breakout films Slacker and Dazed and Confused, comes a digital video effort that has animated in a process called interpolated rotoscoping, brought to life by 31 animation artists who drew over live-action footage to create a dream-like state that is both real and surreal. The director works in a free-associative manner much like in Slacker and opens on a young vagabond arriving at a town by train. After a ride in an odd car-boat, he meets up with a professor who voices his deep philosophical leanings. The young man stumbles upon more figures that resemble the media, evolution, and even characters out of other Linklater features, including Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, whose characters in Before Sunrise make an appearance, as well as director Steven Soderbergh, who relates an anecdote about Louis Malle telling Billy Wilder that his new film "is like a dream." A non-narrative piece that flows like a fever dream, Waking Life features voicework by over 70 actors, including Wiley Wiggins, Adam Goldberg, and Nicky Katt(n)</desc>

Residing in London, the medically trained Okwe (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is a Nigerian immigrant working as a taxi driver and a hotel concierge, but he still lives on the edge of poverty. He shares a room with Senay (Amélie's Audrey Tautou making her English-language debut), a Turkish refugee who works as a maid at the hotel. As illegal immigrants, Okwe and Senay live in fear of being deported. One night, working at the front desk, Okwe receives a call from prostitute Juliette (Sophie Okonedo) to check a broken toilet, where he makes a horrifying discovery. He reports it to the manager Sneaky (Sergi Lopez), who blackmails Okwe into staying quiet about it. Okwe soon discovers the presence of a shady business operation that sends him into the seedy London underworld. Senay becomes lured in with hopes of being able to fund her escape to America. Dirty Pretty Things marks the screenwriting debut of Steve Knight, co-creator of the game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Chicago</title>
    <desc lang="en">A starry-eyed would-be star discovers just how far the notion that "there's no such thing as bad publicity" can go in this screen adaptation of the hit Broadway musical +Chicago, originally directed and choreographed by Bob Fosse. In the mid-'20s, Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) is a small-time chorus dancer married to a well-meaning dunderhead named Amos (John C. Reilly). Roxie is having an affair on the side with Fred Casley (Dominic West), a smooth talker who insists he can make her a star. However, Fred strings Roxie along a bit too far for his own good, and when she realizes that his promises are empty, she becomes enraged and murders Fred in cold blood. Roxie soon finds herself behind bars alongside Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a sexy vaudeville star who used to perform with her sister until Velma discovered that her sister had been sleeping with her husband. Velma shot them both dead, and, after scheming prison matron "Mama" Morton hooks Velma up with hotshot lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), Velma becomes the new Queen of the scandal sheets. Roxie is just shrewd enough to realize that her poor fortune could also bring her fame, so she convinces Amos to also hire Flynn. Soon Flynn is splashing Roxie's story -- or, more accurately, a highly melodramatic revision of Roxie's story -- all over the gutter press, and Roxy and Velma are soon battling neck-to-neck over who can win greater fame through the headlines. A project that had been moving from studio to studio since the musical opened on Broadway in 1973, Chicago also features guest appearances by Lucy Liu and Christine Baranski(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Ang Lee's haunting drama won the Best Screenplay award in Cannes and was a hit with the critics for its powerful evocation of the listless decadence that characterised the closing years of the '70s. Starring Kevin Kline and Sigourney Weaver, the film is set against the backdrop of a small Connecticut town shrouded in winter in the dark days of Watergate. The parallel experiences of the adults and children of one family are shown as they experiment with sex and drugs in an increasingly desperate attempt to create meaning in their shallow, bourgeois lives, unaware that a storm is fast approaching(n)</desc>

Residing in London, the medically trained Okwe (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is a Nigerian immigrant working as a taxi driver and a hotel concierge, but he still lives on the edge of poverty. He shares a room with Senay (Amélie's Audrey Tautou making her English-language debut), a Turkish refugee who works as a maid at the hotel. As illegal immigrants, Okwe and Senay live in fear of being deported. One night, working at the front desk, Okwe receives a call from prostitute Juliette (Sophie Okonedo) to check a broken toilet, where he makes a horrifying discovery. He reports it to the manager Sneaky (Sergi Lopez), who blackmails Okwe into staying quiet about it. Okwe soon discovers the presence of a shady business operation that sends him into the seedy London underworld. Senay becomes lured in with hopes of being able to fund her escape to America.

    <desc lang="en">The director (Rob Cohen) and star (Vin Diesel) of the previous summer's hit The Fast and the Furious (2001) are reunited for this spy thriller billed as a next-generation James Bond adventure. Diesel stars as Xander Cage, a nihilist extreme sports enthusiast nicknamed "Triple X" because of a large tattoo covering his back and neck. Cage's illegal stunts and poor attitude (he's given to spouting dialogue such as, "Have you ever been punched in the face for talking too much?") land him in jail, where he's recruited/blackmailed into government service by the National Security Agency's Augustus Gibbons, who likes Cage for his skills and expendability. The new secret agent is assigned to infiltrate a Russian crime ring called Anarchy 99, whose access to biochemical weaponry is making the United States extremely nervous. With the help of some high-tech gadgets from weapons master Toby Lee Shavers (Michael Roof), Cage is able to make his way into Anarchy 99, where he targets the group's leader Yorgi (Marton Csokas) and falls for the organization's second-in-command, Yelena (Asia Argento). XXX (2002) is the first in a hoped-for franchise of sequels for the film's producer, Revolution Studios(n)</desc>
