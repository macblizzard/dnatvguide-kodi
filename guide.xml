    <desc lang="en">Scientist Mark Evans enlists the aid of an international team of geneticists as he sets out to determine whether there is a rational explanation for the legendary Tibetan yeti. Mark's investigation centres on two competing theories, the first being that the `Abominable Snowman' is in fact a species of `human' marginalised by the rise of homo sapiens, the other stating that the yeti is some form of previously undiscovered bear. Renowned mountaineer Reinhold Messner - who claims to have encountered a yeti - weighs in on the subject, subscribing to the latter theory, while Professor Rasmus Neilsen shares his research into the Denisovans, a long-lost species of human with DNA connections to modern Tibetans, which may have inspired Himalayan folk tales of `wild men' who would later become known as `yetis'.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Sunshine State</title>
    <desc lang="en">Like Lone Star, Sunshine State is a John Sayles film in which a multitude of characters struggle with the past, both recent and ancient -- both family history and the traumatic past of the land itself. It's set on the fictional Plantation Island in Florida, the history of which is based upon Amelia Island, where the film was actually shot. Lincoln Beach, the once thriving black community on the island, is based on the region's American Beach. Sunshine State portrays a relentless onslaught of real estate developers in the area. Desiree Perry (Angela Bassett, who was also in Sayles' Passion Fish and City of Hope) has returned to Florida for the first time since being sent away as a pregnant teen. She nervously brings her husband, Reggie (James McDaniel of NYPD Blue), an anesthesiologist, to meet her estranged mother, Eunice (Mary Alice). Eunice has recently taken in a troubled teenaged relative, Terrell (newcomer Alexander Lewis). Eunice's friend, Dr. Lloyd (Bill Cobbs), is trying to rally the Lincoln Beach community to slow development. Marly Temple (Edie Falco of The Sopranos, here playing a Southerner) runs the motel owned by her ailing father (Ralph Waite of Waltons fame), but has little interest in the business, and the developers are pressuring her to get her father to sell. She's in the process of ending a relationship with the local golf pro (Marc Blucas from TV's Buffy the Vampire Slayer), when a rather mercenary landscape architect, Jack Meadows (Timothy Hutton), catches her eye. Meanwhile, Francine Pickney (Mary Steenburgen) is so busy organizing the town's cheesy Buccaneer Days festival that she doesn't realize that her husband, Earl (Gordan Clapp, also of NYPD Blue and a Sayles regular) is suicidal. As usual, Sayles wrote, directed, and edited the film, with Maggie Renzi producing(n)</desc>

Seven years later, the couple was reunited, and, despite having taken radically different paths, they found themselves unable to resist the call of a second chance.

However, gangster Eddie Kim has secreted crates of venomous serpents in the cargo hold and when they're released, all hell breaks loose. The film earned a reputation for the inclusion of plot lines from blogging fans, including one now infamous line. Despite the novel approach to its production, David R Ellis's film is surprisingly well-acted and tense, with both Julianna Margulies as flight attendant Claire Miller and David Koechner as co-pilot Rick receiving a fair share of the cracking dialogue(n)</desc>

Civil War veteran John Carter (Taylor Kitsch) was still haunted by the violence he witnessed on the battlefield when he inexplicably awoke on the distant planet of Barsoom (Mars). Upon learning that the inhabitants of Barsoom are bracing for a major conflict and that war appears inevitable, John finds out that love is a rare commodity on the Red Planet, and summons the courage to be the hero the Martians have been hoping for. Meanwhile, John falls under the spell of the enchanting Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins), who struggles to suppress her compassion in a society known for its warlike ways.

As if that weren't enough, they've been assembled together in 1900 by Queen Victoria as a team of evil-fighting heroes. Among them are Allan Quatermain (Sean Connery) from H. Rider Haggard's King Solomon's Mines; Mina Harker (Peta Wilson) from Bram Stoker's Dracula; Tom Sawyer (Shane West) from several works by Mark Twain; Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend) from Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray; Captain Nemo (Naseeruddin Shah) from Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea; The Invisible Man (Tony Curran) from H.G. Wells book of the same name; and several others. Working together, the odd assortment of characters must combine their powers to defeat a mysterious villain and save the world from certain destruction. Directed by Stephen Norrington (Blade), The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen also stars Jason Flemyng, Tom Goodman-Hill, and David Hemmings(n)</desc>

Suave gangster Charlie Barrett (Christopher Walken) meets four young men who have taken over his regular booth at a popular bistro. Charmed by the swaggering kids, he agrees to take a ride with them, but they give him a sedative and he awakens in a deserted mansion, taped to a chair with one of his fingers missing. One of his abductors, Avery (Henry Thomas), says that he has a sister who has been kidnapped and they need two million dollars to get her back, as well as a finger to exchange for her severed digit. Charlie phones his lawyer Marty (Cliff De Young), who calls a henchman, Lono (Denis Leary), who investigates the kidnappings and gives Charlie enough information to start playing each of his inexperienced abductors against the others(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">France v Scotland (Kick-off 3.00pm). Gabby Logan presents coverage from the Stade de France in Paris, where the second round of fixtures reaches a conclusion. France have gone from being regular title contenders with an emphasis on the unexpected to being also-rans in the last few years, and they finished fifth in the standings in 2016, when they also lost to Scotland at Murrayfield. That victory for the Scots was their first in 10 years over Les Bleus, but their losing streak in Paris goes back much further, to 1999. With commentary by Andrew Cotter, Chris Paterson and Ali Williams, and analysis by Mike Blair, Andy Nicol and Thomas Castaignede.(n)</desc>

Also featured are the world's most expensive pet accessories and the sad story of Kalu the chimp - who missed out on an inheritance of £40million when its owner revealed she had lost her entire fortune.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Rocker</title>
    <desc lang="en">The Office star Rainn Wilson portrays a drummer named "Fish," who gets a second shot at fame 20 years after getting kicked out of his band on the very night they signed the record contract that made them stars. Fish has spent the past two decades languishing at soul-crushing day jobs while his old bandmates became legends, continuing to grace magazine covers and dominate the radio. He might just get another chance at musical success, however, when his teenage cousin invites him to drum for his high school garage band, and they end up catching the ear of record executives. Now, Fish is determined to live the hedonistic rock &amp; roll lifestyle he missed out on 20 years ago, but his new bandmates don't appreciate his hard partying -- and neither do his middle-aged knees. This Fox Atomic comedy co-stars Christina Applegate. Shawn Levy (Night at the Museum) and Tom McNulty co-produced the feature, which was penned by Wallace Wolodarsky and Maya Forbes, and directed by Peter Cattaneo (Opal Dream)(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A disturbing videotape appears to hold the power of life and death over those who view it in this offbeat thriller. A strange videotape begins making the rounds in a town in the Pacific Northwest; it is full of bizarre and haunting images, and after watching it, many viewers receive a telephone call in which they are warned they will die in seven days. A handful of teenagers who watched the tape while spending a weekend at a cabin in the mountains scoff at the threat, but as predicted, they all die suddenly on the same night. Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts), the aunt of one of the ill-fated teens, is a journalist who has decided to investigate the matter and travels West with her young son, Aidan (David Dorfman), a troubled child who has been drawing pictures of strange and ominous visions. Rachel managed to find the cabin in the woods and watches the video herself; afterward, she receives the same phone call, and realizes she must solve the puzzle of the video and the person or persons behind it within a week. Rachel turns to her ex, Noah (Martin Henderson), an expert in video technology, who at first is convinced the story is a hoax until he digs deeper into the mystery. The Ring was adapted from a 1996 Japanese film by Hideo Nakata, which became a massive box-office success in Asia and spawned two sequels(n)</desc>

Jorge's (Cesar Ramos) adolescent sister, Adriana (Paulina Gaitan), has been kidnapped and thrust into a lucrative underground trade in which young girls are bought and sold to the highest bidder.

After circumventing immigration officers and eventually working his way across the border, the desperate Jorge comes into contact with a Texas lawman named Ray (Kevin Kline), whose own devastating personal loss to sex traffickers causes him to join the search for Adriana. In the dark days that follow, Jorge and Ray form a close bond as they witness the horrors of a secret Internet sex slave auction and discover just how far the depths of human depravity can plunge while attempting to maintain hope that brother and sister will one day be reunited. In the world of international sex trafficking, however, innocent victims disappear without a trace every day and few who fall prey to these reprehensible predators are ever seen again(n)</desc>

Fish has spent the past two decades languishing at soul-crushing day jobs while his old bandmates became legends, continuing to grace magazine covers and dominate the radio. He might just get another chance at musical success, however, when his teenage cousin invites him to drum for his high school garage band, and they end up catching the ear of record executives. Now, Fish is determined to live the hedonistic rock &amp; roll lifestyle he missed out on 20 years ago, but his new bandmates don't appreciate his hard partying -- and neither do his middle-aged knees. This Fox Atomic comedy co-stars Christina Applegate. Shawn Levy (Night at the Museum) and Tom McNulty co-produced the feature, which was penned by Wallace Wolodarsky and Maya Forbes, and directed by Peter Cattaneo (Opal Dream)(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Ring</title>
    <desc lang="en">A disturbing videotape appears to hold the power of life and death over those who view it in this offbeat thriller. A strange videotape begins making the rounds in a town in the Pacific Northwest; it is full of bizarre and haunting images, and after watching it, many viewers receive a telephone call in which they are warned they will die in seven days. A handful of teenagers who watched the tape while spending a weekend at a cabin in the mountains scoff at the threat, but as predicted, they all die suddenly on the same night. Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts), the aunt of one of the ill-fated teens, is a journalist who has decided to investigate the matter and travels West with her young son, Aidan (David Dorfman), a troubled child who has been drawing pictures of strange and ominous visions. Rachel managed to find the cabin in the woods and watches the video herself; afterward, she receives the same phone call, and realizes she must solve the puzzle of the video and the person or persons behind it within a week. Rachel turns to her ex, Noah (Martin Henderson), an expert in video technology, who at first is convinced the story is a hoax until he digs deeper into the mystery. The Ring was adapted from a 1996 Japanese film by Hideo Nakata, which became a massive box-office success in Asia and spawned two sequels(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A Murder in Greenwich: The Martha Moxley Case. (@A&amp;E) investigates the untouchables in American Justice: Martha Moxley. In the 1970s, as today, the Kennedy name carried a lot of clout. Its clan members were a hounded and romanticized group. But when trouble strikes too close to home, someone must be held accountable. Martha Moxley was an energetic teenager who resided in the prestigious neighborhood of Belle Haven in Greenwich, CT. After a night of Halloween parties, Moxley turned up beaten to death outside the home of Michael and Thomas Skakel, cousins to Robert Kennedy. For almost 25 years, the murder went unsolved. Rumors circulated that it was one of the two boys, who both professed a romantic interest in the popular girl. When a broken golf club used to kill Moxley was linked to the Skakel family, the case was still uninvestigated. A&amp;E asks why such a strong lead went ignored for so long and wonders if money can buy innocence(n)</desc>

From dense forests to snow-capped peaks, steamy swamps to endless savannah, it's also a land of unpredictable extremes, where creatures must adapt to survive. In Tanzania, a tiny lizard risks its life to eat flies from the face of a sleepy lion. The nesting habits of the 4ft shoebill are also captured on camera - the giant bird has two chicks, but due to sibling rivalry only one will survive. On the plains of Amboseli, a baby elephant is near to death in the drought, so its mother leaves the herd to stay with her offspring until the bitter end.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">David Attenborough explores the vast and diverse continent, aiming to show its landscapes and wildlife as they have never been seen before. He begins in the Kalahari desert, Africa's south-west corner, where clever meerkats are outsmarted by a wily bird's use of mimicry, a solitary rhino is seen to exhibit previously unknown sociable behaviours, terrifying insects prey on baby birds and the rarest fish in the world is filmed for the first time. In the neighbouring Namib desert, which receives almost no rain, the competition for scant resources can be fierce, as proven by a ferocious fight for supremacy between two giraffes.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Savannah.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">David Attenborough continues his exploration of the continent in east Africa, which is a haven for life and supports a higher density of large mammals than anywhere else on Earth. From dense forests to snow-capped peaks, steamy swamps to endless savannah, it's also a land of unpredictable extremes, where creatures must adapt to survive. In Tanzania, a tiny lizard risks its life to eat flies from the face of a sleepy lion. The nesting habits of the 4ft shoebill are also captured on camera - the giant bird has two chicks, but due to sibling rivalry only one will survive. On the plains of Amboseli, a baby elephant is near to death in the drought, so its mother leaves the herd to stay with her offspring until the bitter end.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Congo.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">David Attenborough looks at the varied creatures of the Congo rainforest, one of the most competitive habitats on Earth. A sweet-toothed chimpanzee uses a complex array of tools to access honey from a beehive, the elusive picathartes bird feeds unsuspecting frogs to its dinosaur-like chicks and a massive female python reveals her maternal side as she sunbathes to incubate her eggs. Tiny leaf-folding frogs battle it out kung fu style, and as darkness falls the forest elephants gather to face their rivals.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">David Attenborough describes some of the wildlife spectacles of southern Africa, starting out in a little-explored rainforest discovered less than a decade ago by scientists who spotted it on satellite maps. There, thousands of butterflies dance for the right to mate, while on a tiny island off Mozambique, green turtles emerge from eggs and begin a hazardous journey to the water - with pied crows and hungry crabs eager to get them. Cameras also capture one of the largest gatherings of great white sharks on the planet as 30 of the predators circle around a dead whale.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">David Attenborough explores the wildlife eking out an existence in and around the scorching wilderness of the Sahara Desert, where only the toughest survive. It's a constant struggle against dehydration, as zebra battle over dwindling rivers, camels search for water and tiny barn swallows navigate thousands of square miles of barren sand to find a life-saving oasis. The naked mole rat avoids the heat by living a subterranean existence, while the silver ant is able to take on the midday sun - but needs a `spacesuit' to do it.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Trash of the Titans. Looking to boost sales, Costington's Department Store invents a new holiday, Love Day, which prompts Springfield residents to buy one another gifts such as "Sir Loves-A-Lot, the bear who loves to love." However, all those boxes and wrapping paper mean plenty of trash, and Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta), typically late in taking the trash out to the curb, curses the sanitation workers when they don't pick up his rubbish. The angry garbage men refuse to pick up the Simpsons' trash until Homer apologizes, which he's highly reluctant to do. Eventually, Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) apologizes on her husband's behalf, which leads to an angry confrontation between Homer and Ray Patterson (voice of Steve Martin), Springfield's sanitation commissioner. Homer decides to put Patterson out of business by running for sanitation commissioner himself, and after making a number of ridiculous promises and slandering his opponent, Homer wins the office. However, Homer's ambitious plans cause him to blow through his annual sanitation budget in less than a month, and to cover up his mistakes, he starts accepting dangerous waste from other cities until Springfield's landfills are overflowing. First aired on April 26, 1998, "Trash of the Titans" also features a guest appearance from Bono, The Edge, Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen of the rock group U2 as themselves(n)</desc>

While at the prison, Marge meets a handsome convict Jack (voice of Michael Keaton), and while she's told he has such a reputation Bob Dylan wrote a protest song to keep him behind bars, Marge is certain he has a sensitive side that ought to be nurtured. Marge persuades the Warden (voice of Charles Napier) to let her teach an art class at the prison, and Jack soon becomes her star pupil. Swayed by Jack's charm, good looks and talent, Marge speaks out in favor of his parole, and once he's freed, helps him land a job at Springfield Elementary School, where Principal Skinner (voice of Harry Shearer) hires him to create a mural celebrating the school's motto, "Puma Pride." Jack's finished product, however, isn't what Marge or Skinner has in mind, and soon Jack lapses back into his criminal lifestyle. "Pokey Mom" first aired on January 14, 2001(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Drumline</title>
    <desc lang="en">After decades of movies about college sports, the bands who take the field at halftime finally get their day in the sun in this musical comedy drama. Devon Miles (Nick Cannon) is a talented young percussionist from Harlem who wins a music scholarship to Atlanta A &amp; T, a prestigious African-American university. For years, Atlanta A &amp; T has won awards for their show-style marching band, who combine expert musicianship (incorporating funk, R&amp;B, and jazz rhythms into the traditional marching band repertoire) with choreography, dancing cheerleaders, and roof-raising showmanship. Dr. Aaron Lee (Orlando Jones), the school's band director, gives Devon a spot in the marching band's drumline, the heart and soul of a show-style band, but discovers Devon's previous musical education hardly meets his usual standard when he learns that his new drummer can't read music. Devon soon earns a reputation as a stubborn individualist within the band, not necessarily a good thing in an ensemble where a strictly unified performance is considers the ideal. Devon's cocksure attitude and streetwise style doesn't mesh very comfortably with Sean Taylor (Leonard Roberts), a disciplined senior who resents the presence of the upstart freshman in the drumline, and things become even less harmonious when Devon begins making a play for Laila (Zoe Saldana), a beautiful girl who is also being courted by Sean. Songwriter and record producer Dallas Austin, who has worked with Boyz II Men, TLC, and Pink, served as executive producer for Drumline, helped produce the film's musical score, and contributed his own experiences as a marching band member to the screenplay(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A gifted forger and confidence man attempts to stay one step ahead of the lawman determined to bring him to justice in this comedy-drama from Steven Spielberg, based on a true story. Frank W. Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a 16-year-old high school student who finds himself emotionally cut adrift when his mother, Paula (Nathalie Baye), leaves his father, Frank Abagnale Sr. (Christopher Walken), after Frank Sr. falls into arrears with the Internal Revenue Service. One day at school, Frank Jr. attempts to pass himself off as a substitute teacher, and easily makes the subterfuge work. His small-scale success gives Frank some ideas, and he soon discovers bigger and more profitable ways of hoaxing others, passing himself off as an airline pilot, a doctor, and an attorney. Along the way, Frank learns how to become a master forger, and uses his talent and charm to pass over 2.5 million dollars in phony checks. Frank's increasingly audacious work soon attracts the attention of Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), an FBI agent who is determined to put Frank behind bars. Frank seems to enjoy being pursued by Carl, and even goes so far as to call Carl on the phone to chat every once in a while. While posing as a doctor, Frank falls in love with Brenda Strong (Amy Adams), a sweet girl working as a candy striper. When Frank asks Brenda to marry him, he decides to assume a new identity to impress her father, Roger (Martin Sheen) -- who happens to be the District Attorney of New Orleans, LA. Catch Me If You Can was based on the autobiography of the real Frank W. Abagnale Jr., who has a cameo in the film and today works on the side of the law as a top consultant on preventing forgery and designing secure checking systems(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Drumline</title>
    <desc lang="en">After decades of movies about college sports, the bands who take the field at halftime finally get their day in the sun in this musical comedy drama. Devon Miles (Nick Cannon) is a talented young percussionist from Harlem who wins a music scholarship to Atlanta A &amp; T, a prestigious African-American university. For years, Atlanta A &amp; T has won awards for their show-style marching band, who combine expert musicianship (incorporating funk, R&amp;B, and jazz rhythms into the traditional marching band repertoire) with choreography, dancing cheerleaders, and roof-raising showmanship. Dr. Aaron Lee (Orlando Jones), the school's band director, gives Devon a spot in the marching band's drumline, the heart and soul of a show-style band, but discovers Devon's previous musical education hardly meets his usual standard when he learns that his new drummer can't read music. Devon soon earns a reputation as a stubborn individualist within the band, not necessarily a good thing in an ensemble where a strictly unified performance is considers the ideal. Devon's cocksure attitude and streetwise style doesn't mesh very comfortably with Sean Taylor (Leonard Roberts), a disciplined senior who resents the presence of the upstart freshman in the drumline, and things become even less harmonious when Devon begins making a play for Laila (Zoe Saldana), a beautiful girl who is also being courted by Sean. Songwriter and record producer Dallas Austin, who has worked with Boyz II Men, TLC, and Pink, served as executive producer for Drumline, helped produce the film's musical score, and contributed his own experiences as a marching band member to the screenplay(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A gifted forger and confidence man attempts to stay one step ahead of the lawman determined to bring him to justice in this comedy-drama from Steven Spielberg, based on a true story. Frank W. Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a 16-year-old high school student who finds himself emotionally cut adrift when his mother, Paula (Nathalie Baye), leaves his father, Frank Abagnale Sr. (Christopher Walken), after Frank Sr. falls into arrears with the Internal Revenue Service. One day at school, Frank Jr. attempts to pass himself off as a substitute teacher, and easily makes the subterfuge work. His small-scale success gives Frank some ideas, and he soon discovers bigger and more profitable ways of hoaxing others, passing himself off as an airline pilot, a doctor, and an attorney. Along the way, Frank learns how to become a master forger, and uses his talent and charm to pass over 2.5 million dollars in phony checks. Frank's increasingly audacious work soon attracts the attention of Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), an FBI agent who is determined to put Frank behind bars. Frank seems to enjoy being pursued by Carl, and even goes so far as to call Carl on the phone to chat every once in a while. While posing as a doctor, Frank falls in love with Brenda Strong (Amy Adams), a sweet girl working as a candy striper. When Frank asks Brenda to marry him, he decides to assume a new identity to impress her father, Roger (Martin Sheen) -- who happens to be the District Attorney of New Orleans, LA. Catch Me If You Can was based on the autobiography of the real Frank W. Abagnale Jr., who has a cameo in the film and today works on the side of the law as a top consultant on preventing forgery and designing secure checking systems(n)</desc>

The setting is Los Angeles, CA, and the event is the wedding between a man and a woman who always seemed destined to be together. Unfortunately, all relationships can't be as healthy as Elise and Michael's is, and though best man and maid of honor Rich (Aaron Stanford) and Samantha (Melissa Sagemiller) seem to be preparing to take the plunge, the same certainly cannot be said for neurotic actress Lana (Mena Suvari).

    <desc lang="en">In September 2004, comedian Dave Chappelle took a break from his immensely successful Comedy Central show to stage a free, unpublicized, all-star hip-hop concert in the Clinton Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn, NY. Inviting fans over the Internet, on the street, and even in his family's hometown of Yellow Springs, OH, Chappelle asked filmmaker Michel Gondry to document the event from its inception on through to the performances themselves. The result is Dave Chappelle's Block Party, a concert film that provides not only a sampling of the music on display that September, but also an intimate look at the comedian himself. Gondry's cameras tag along with Chappelle as he visits Ohio, recruits a university marching band to play at the show, and surveys the opinions of Clinton Hill on the show that's about to take place. Along the way, we're introduced to some the comedian's favorite acts, in rehearsals and on-stage: Dead Prez, Jill Scott, Mos Def, the Roots, Erykah Badu, Kanye West, and the surprise reuniting of the Fugees(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A young robot with incredible powers, super strength, and the purest spirit on the planet discovers the joys of being human while embarking on a worldwide journey to discover his true potential in this animated update of Osamu Tezuka's classic anime story. Astro Boy (Freddie Highmore) is a young robot from futuristic Metro City. Created by a brilliant scientist named Tenma (Nicolas Cage), and powered by pure positive "blue" energy that gives him such abilities as x-ray vision, inhuman speed, and flight, the wide-eyed android longs to find his true place in the world.

He spends the vast majority of his time smoking pot and explaining how he's waiting to understand his own fate, using the film Signs as the model for how he takes in the world. His brother Pat (Ed Helms) is a salesman in a mid-life crisis having purchased a sweet new sports car over the objections of his wife (Judy Greer). After Jeff answers the phone and a voice demands to speak to "Kevin," the stoner believes this is the sign he's been waiting for. During the course of the day, Jeff and Pat will confront their issues with each other, while their long-suffering mother (Susan Sarandon) may find love for the first time since the death of her husband. The film played at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival(n)</desc>

This leads to an opportunity for Lucy to memorise the businesswoman's ledger, which may hold the key to the whole operation. Last in the series.(n)</desc>

Izzie (Katherine Heigl) can't get into the holiday spirit because she's still p.o.'ed at Alex (Justin Chambers), who for his part is convinced that he'll fail again when he takes his board exams for the second time. Back at the hospital, Bailey (Chandra Wilson) maintains her backbreaking schedule despite her pregnancy; George (T.R. Knight) can't help but feel that his patient's obnoxious relatives are the root cause for her gastric ulcer; and Cristina (Sandra Oh) and Burke (Isaiah Washington) have a theological argument while trying to persuade a 10-year-old to undergo a heart transplant. Finally, though Derek (Patrick Dempsey) and Addison (Kate Walsh have reconciled for the umpteenth time, it doesn't last long--a fact that doesn't make Addison happy, but which may turn out to be the best Christmas present that Meredith (Ellen Pompeo) ever had(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Grand Designs</title>
    <desc lang="en">Kevin McCloud returns to Devon for an update on an inspirational build. Royal Marine Captain Jon White and his wife Becky were living happily in a small cottage when in June 2010, while serving in Afghanistan, Jon stepped on an improvised explosive device, losing three limbs. Every part of their lives had to change - starting with where they could live. Their architect came up with a cutting-edge, semi open-plan building with a dramatic wing-like-roof - and crucially no obvious signs of adaptations for Jon's disabilities. Has the new home proved as enabling for the couple and their expanding family as they had hoped?.(n)</desc>

With the mantra greed…is good, Gordon Gekko encapsulates the 1980's drive for excess and ruthless ambition in Oliver Stone's Wall Street while big traders mirror his notoriously bad behaviour with insider trading and drug use in real life. Cocaine has become the drug of choice for those celebrating success; Miami's status as a drug dealing haven inspires the launch of one of the '80s most famous television series: Miami Vice. Meanwhile, the change in cocaine importation routes puts Mexico centre stage in the drug business, placing Mexican cartels in the position to become heads of a multi-billion dollar industry today. The '80s experienced its share of tragedies - a leak at an American-owned chemical plant in India sends 40 tonnes of one of the most toxic chemicals known to man over the sleeping city of Bhopal, India. Within hours, at least 3,000 are dead and another 50,000 are left disabled.

    <desc lang="en">France v Scotland (Kick-off 3.00pm). Coverage from the Stade de France in Paris, where the second round of fixtures reaches a conclusion. France have gone from being regular title contenders with an emphasis on the unexpected to being also-rans in the last few years, and they finished fifth in the standings in 2016, when they also lost to Scotland at Murrayfield. That victory for the Scots was their first in 10 years over Les Bleus, but their losing streak in Paris goes back much further, to 1999. Presented by Daire O'Brien, with commentary by Ryle Nugent and Bernard Jackman, and analysis from Eddie O'Sullivan, Ronan O'Gara and Shane Horgan.(n)</desc>

Now he returns to discover an industry in crisis due to the deluge of free internet porn - and when he tries to catch up with some of the actors he finds one has fled, another has been sent to prison and a third has killed himself. He also talks to some of the new performers, asking how they cope in a business that offers less money, more insecurity and greater stress than ever before.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Fast Times at Ridgemont High</title>
    <desc lang="en">Back in the late 1970s, author Cameron Crowe banked upon his youthful appearance to pose as a teen-aged high school student. The results of his hands-on research was the revelatory book Fast Times at Ridgemont High, which went on to spectacular success as a theatrical feature. The sociological inner lining of Crowe's book was sacrificed in favor of standard teen-movie dialogue and Animal House-style comedy, but the film is impossible to dislike, and it spawned a legion of future imitators. Ostensibly, the main characters are brother and sister Jennifer Jason Leigh and Judge Reinhold. However, the real breakthrough star is Sean Penn as the perpetually zoned-out Jeff Spicoli. It is Penn who has the film's most famous scene, wherein the decorum of teacher Hand (Ray Walston)'s classroom is interrupted by a pizza delivery. Fast Times at Ridgemont High was spun off into a TV series, the short-lived 1986 weekly Fast Times(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A woman has to learn how to love and trust men all over again in this comedy drama. Helen McCarter (Kimberly Elise) would seem to have it all -- she's been married for 18 years to Charles (Steve Harris), and over the course of their time together, he's become one of Atlanta's most successful attorneys. But despite wealth and prestige, things are not as they should be at the McCarter home, and on their anniversary, Charles drops a bombshell on Helen -- he's divorcing her for another woman. Escorted out of the house with nowhere to go, Helen moves in with her grandmother Madea (Tyler Perry), a sassy woman with no shortage of opinions and a gun that she's not afraid to use. As Madea helps Helen get back on her feet emotionally, the divorcée makes the acquaintance of Orlando (Shemar Moore), a handsome man who is obviously attracted to her. But after her experiences with Charles, Helen isn't sure if she's ready to trust a man again. Diary of a Mad Black Woman was adapted from the popular stage play by Tyler Perry, who also plays several roles in the film, most prominently Madea; it marked the first feature-film credit for successful music video director Darren R.

Though his extravagant family cookouts were welcome at his old digs, Todd's stuffy new neighbors -- particularly the conservative Republican Judge Halsted Crowley (Danny Glover) -- are less than thrilled with the arrival of Todd's massive family. Complicating the situation further is the eccentric neighborhood security guard (Queen Latifah), who takes on the heady assignment of ensuring that none of the private community's rules are broken, as well as two thugs who, determined to get an autographed pair of sneakers, hold up the cookout at gunpoint.

    <title lang="en">Fast Times at Ridgemont High</title>
    <desc lang="en">Back in the late 1970s, author Cameron Crowe banked upon his youthful appearance to pose as a teen-aged high school student. The results of his hands-on research was the revelatory book Fast Times at Ridgemont High, which went on to spectacular success as a theatrical feature. The sociological inner lining of Crowe's book was sacrificed in favor of standard teen-movie dialogue and Animal House-style comedy, but the film is impossible to dislike, and it spawned a legion of future imitators.

Fast Times at Ridgemont High was spun off into a TV series, the short-lived 1986 weekly Fast Times(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">There's Something About Mary</title>
    <desc lang="en">This smash hit, gross-out comedy is laugh-out-loud funny and stars Ben Stiller and Cameron Diaz. Ted decides that, ever since an unfortunate accident with a zipper made him miss the prom with the lovely Mary, his life has been a failure. 13 years later he hires a detective to track her down but, when he succeeds, the detective also falls in love with her. Soon Ted finds himself competing for Mary's affections with a man who will stop at nothing to win her over. Unmissable, if only for the notorious 'hair gel' scene(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Nine Months</title>
    <desc lang="en">A single man faces the terrifying prospect of seeing his carefree life dashed by a visit from the stork in this comedy. Samuel Falkner (Hugh Grant) is a child psychiatrist who has no kids of his own and doesn't want any, which leaves him a bit shaken when his girlfriend of five years, Rebecca Taylor (Julianne Moore) announces that she's pregnant. Suddenly, Samuel is plagued by paranoid fantasies about how marriage and fatherhood will change his life, which are not at all soothed by frequent visits from Rebecca's chronically-pregnant friend Gail Dwyer (Joan Cusack) and her half-bright lummox of a husband, Marty (Tom Arnold). Too selfish to deal with Rebecca's needs, Samuel parts company with her and takes a last stab at playing the field, but when he sees an ultrasound of his soon-to-be-born son, he decides that it's time to face his responsibilities before it's too late. Nine Months also features Robin Williams in a small role as Dr. Kosevich, an ob-gyn with a weak grasp of the English language(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Supercross</title>
    <desc lang="en">Two siblings find themselves competing on and off the racetrack in this action-packed drama. K.C. Carlyle (Steve Howey) and his kid brother, Trip (Mike Vogel), are both racers in the rough and tumble world of supercross, a revved-up variation on motocross racing in which specially modified motorcycle negotiate specially built dirt tracks that send riders through tricky twists and turns, over rough terrain, and off high-flying jumps. Both are talented racers, but K.C. has a wilder and more reckless approach, while Trip follows a more cautious path. A more profound difference between them arises when K.C. is offered a lucrative deal to ride for a factory-sponsored team; he takes the deal, and leaves his brother behind to race on his own dime. However, when an accident takes Trip out of the running on the supercross circuit, he and K.C. set aside their differences as Trip helps coach his older brother so he can succeed in his drive to the championship. Made with the cooperation of a leading supercross race promoter, Supercross: The Movie also stars Sophia Bush and Cameron Richardson as the brothers' love interests, and Robert Carradine as a determined race coach(n)</desc>

Selene is a leading werewolf hunter who learns that the Lycans have plans to capture the human who witnessed their battle.

    <desc lang="en">Mr. Dingle, the Strong. First telecast March 3, 1961, this is a deft reworking of the first-season Twilight Zone episode "Mr. Bevis." Making his second appearance on the series, Burgess Meredith stars as Luther Dingle, a mild-mannered salesman whom a pair of Martians select for a most unusual experiment. The aliens endow Dingle with the strength of 300 men, a gift which he eventually abuses and loses. The ending of this one is a beaut. Don Rickles costars as an obnoxious horse player, displaying the same comic invective with which he infested his nightlclub act. Written by Rod Serling, "Mr. Dingle, the Strong" would be remade, after a fashion, as the third-season Twilight Zone entry "Cavender Is Coming."(n)</desc>

Dean Jagger stars as Ed Lindsay, a cranky middle-aged man living in a boarding house with several other old-timers, including his former fiancée Vinnie Brown (Carmen Mathews). Fed up with television, Ed squirrels himself away in his room, where he begins tooling around with the antique radio he's found in the cellar. Before long, he is receiving broadcasts from the 1930s and 1940s -- live broadcasts, not reruns. Having opened a window to the past, Ed desperately tries to correct several mistakes he's made in life. Scripted by Charles Beaumont from a story by OCee Ritch, "Static" was one of six videotaped Twilight Zone episodes and was originally telecast March 10, 1961 (and yes, that voice emanating from Ed's old-time radio does belong to future Hogan's Heroes star Bob Crane)(n)</desc>

Using a toy telephone he'd received for his birthday, Billy communicates with his beloved Grandma -- several days and weeks after her death. Philip Abbott and Patricia Smith costar as Billy's distraught parents, who are convinced (rightly, as it turns out), that Grandma wants to inveigle the boy into joining her in the Next World.

(NBC did not count the series' 1990 pilot, which had originally been produced for CBS.) Again drawing its inspiration from recent headlines, the episode opens with an apparent fire in a high-rise apartment, culminating horribly when the baby son of popular comedian Monty Bender (Adam Ferrara) falls from the apartment window to his death. What appears to be a tragic accident leads to the reopening of an old pedophilia charge against Bender, and a startling revelation involving the parents of a young boy who'd been paid off to drop their case against the beleaguered comic. Real-life comedian Larry Miller, who'd played a murderer on two earlier episodes, is here cast as himself. This was the final episode of Law &amp; Order's 13th season(n)</desc>
