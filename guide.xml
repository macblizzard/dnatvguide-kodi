    <title lang="en">The Restoration Man</title>
    <desc lang="en">Londoners Justin Hooper and Charlotte Seddon have a dramatic vision for a derelict airfield control tower in the Highlands. But simply restoring the 700 window panes to their original modernist look swallows 40 per cent of their budget, and the difficulties of project-managing the build from 600 miles away make it increasingly hard for the couple to make the final leap from their city home. George Clarke helps them realise their plans for this 4,000 sq ft military space, and meets the people who were willing to sacrifice everything as the tower played a crucial role during the Second World War.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Malcolm X</title>
    <desc lang="en">Writer-director Spike Lee's epic portrayal of the life and times of the slain civil rights leader Malcolm X begins with the cross-cut imagery of the police beating of black motorist Rodney King juxtaposed with an American flag burning into the shape of the letter X. When the film's narrative begins moments later, it jumps back to World War II-era Boston, where Malcolm Little (Denzel Washington) is making his living as a hustler. The son of a Baptist preacher who was murdered by the Ku Klux Klan, Little was raised by foster parents after his mother was deemed clinically insane; as an adult, he turned to a life of crime, which leads to his imprisonment on burglary charges. In jail, Little receives epiphany in the form of an introduction to Islam; he is especially taken with the lessons of Elijah Mohammed, who comes to him in a vision. Adopting the name 'Malcolm X' as a rejection of the 'Little' surname (given his family by white slave owners), he meets the real Elijah Mohammed (Al Freeman, Jr.) upon exiting prison, and begins work as a spokesman for the Nation of Islam. Marriage to a Muslim nurse named Betty Shabazz (Angela Bassett) follows, after which X spearheads a well-attended march on a Harlem hospital housing a Muslim recovering from an episode of police brutality. The march's success helps elevate X to the position of Islam's national spokesperson. There is dissension in the ranks, however, and soon X is targeted for assassination by other Nation leaders; even Elijah Mohammed fears Malcolm's growing influence. After getting wind of the murder plot, X leaves the Nation of Islam, embarking on a pilgrimage to Mecca that proves revelatory; renouncing his separatist beliefs, his oratories begin embracing all races and cultures. During a 1965 speech, Malcolm X is shot and killed, reportedly by Nation of Islam members(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Scent of a Woman</title>
    <desc lang="en">Driven by an extravagant, tour-de-force performance by Al Pacino, Scent of a Woman is the story of Frank Slade (Pacino), a blind, retired army colonel who hires Charlie Simms (Chris O'Donnell), a poor college student on the verge of expulsion, to take care of him over Thanksgiving weekend. At the beginning of the weekend, Frank takes Charlie to New York, where he reveals to the student that he intends to visit his family, have a few terrific meals, sleep with a beautiful woman and, finally, commit suicide. The film follows the mis-matched pair over the course of the weekend, as they learn about life through their series of adventures. Though the story is a little contrived and predictable, it pulls all the right strings, thanks to O'Donnell's sympathetic supporting role and Pacino's powerful lead performance, for which he won his first Academy Award. Scent of a Woman is based on the 1975 Italian film Profumo Di Donna(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A Bird in the Head. This typical Three Stooges 2-reel comedy, was the third to be directed by former sound engineer Edward Bernds but, a rather weak effort, only the second released.. According to Bernds, the reason for the film's inadequacy was his own inexperience combined with Curly's increasingly poor health. The most popular Stooge of all time, Curly Howard would suffer a debilitating stroke less than a year later and would be replaced by his brother Shemp Howard. In A Bird in the Head featured the Stooges as paperhangers who get involved with a mad professor (Vernon Dent). The professor is looking for a human brain small enough to fit into a gorilla. The answer: Curly, of course! The 2-reeler marked the Stooges debut of veteran serial menace Frank Lackteen(n)</desc>

The film studio in question, however, is Carnation Pictures ("The Home of Contended Actors.") When Moe, Larry and Curly take over the reigns due to a case of mistaken identity, the usual mayhem ensues. To add Hollywood glamour, Columbia hired former silent screen stars Kenneth Harlan and Mildred Harris, the first Mrs. Charles Chaplin. Veteran screen villain Harry Semels played a highstrung director named Cecil Z. Sweinhardt!(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Dark Water</title>
    <desc lang="en">Directed by Walter Salles Jr., this remake of Hideo Nakata's supernatural psychological drama Honogurai Mizuno Soko Kara revolves around the plight of a single mother (Jennifer Connelly) whose messy divorce and subsequent battle for the custody of her five-year-old daughter is taking a heavy toll on her emotional well-being. Ultimately, the mother and daughter are able to relocate to an apartment, which, despite its excessively dilapidated interior, seems to be an adequate location for beginning a new life. Before long, however, what appears to be the spirit of a young girl begins to haunt them. No stranger to mental illness, the wary young woman brushes the visions aside as part of the inherent stress of making the transition from housewife to working, single mom. As time goes by and the apparent haunting does not subside, the apartment's new residents are forced to examine the history of its former tenants. Dark Water also features performances from John C. Reilly, Tim Roth, and Dougray Scott(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">James Herriot Compilation.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Ellie Harrison visits Thirsk in North Yorkshire to celebrate the centenary of James Herriot's birth, arguably the world's most famous vet. Known as Alf Wight to his family and friends, his semi-autobiographical accounts of his work - which began with the publication of All Creatures Great and Small in 1972 - won him an international fanbase, and inspired many youngsters in the 1970s and 1980s to become vets themselves. Here, Ellie meets Wight's son and daughter, and the vets that run his practice today. She also meets Christopher Timothy, the actor who played the part of Herriot in the BBC's adaptation of All Creatures Great and Small, and revisits classic moments from the Countryfile archive that highlight the work of people who have dedicated their time to helping animals.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Pets - Wild at Heart</title>
    <sub-title lang="en">Playful Creatures.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Though household pets have been trained over thousands of years, they were wild for millions more, and despite the fact that many have taken well to domestic life and provide valuable companionship, their natural instincts remain latent, but are able to be rekindled. David Tennant narrates the first of two programmes revealing the nation's favourite pets in a new light. From playful puppies to hamsters running on the wheel, via chirping budgerigars and scratching cats, the documentary illustrates how these apparently innocuous behavioural traits often conceal a more primitive significance. Cameras visit two islands in Japan, one crowded by rabbits and the other cats, while in Peru dogs leave their home comforts behind on a daily basis to meet up, fight and attempt to attract the interest of a bitch on heat.(n)</desc>

Their rooms come in for some tough criticism, especially from Mike and Tina, and a light-hearted game of bubble football becomes a little too serious for Richard and Sheryl. Over dinner, the guests grill the pair over how they came to be in charge of their business at such a young age, but the genial atmosphere sours for Tina when she discovers Sheryl is a cordon-bleu trained chef.

    <title lang="en">Manchester's Serial Killer</title>
    <desc lang="en">Over the past six years, the remains of more than 90 individuals have been recovered from the canals of Greater Manchester - most of them young men. Headlines are now claiming a serial killer may be responsible for their deaths, a story that has caught fire on social media. In this First Cut documentary, former murder detective Tony Blockley reviews the cases of three young men who drowned in the city's canals. Two of them went missing only to turn up dead later, while the third was seen leaving a nightclub with a mystery man who has never been identified. Is the so-called Pusher real or a 21st-century urban legend?.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Restoration Man</title>
    <desc lang="en">George Clarke returns to witness more neglected architectural treasures rescued across Britain. Young couple Steven Crame and Marina Bacchelli were looking for their first home together in Berkshire when they found a disused water pumping station in its own ancient woodland - ideal to convert into a four-bedroom family home. The couple throw themselves into the task of transforming the huge brick shed their new house, while preserving a 15-ton crane as a central feature of the lounge. It's a tough project - and spiralling costs, flooding and a newborn baby only add to the pressure.(n)</desc>

They begin with a surveillance exercise in the middle of a busy south London market, after which they must demonstrate their ability to come up with believable cover stories.(n)</desc>

Ultimately, the mother and daughter are able to relocate to an apartment, which, despite its excessively dilapidated interior, seems to be an adequate location for beginning a new life.

As time goes by and the apparent haunting does not subside, the apartment's new residents are forced to examine the history of its former tenants. Dark Water also features performances from John C.

    <title lang="en">Harold &amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay</title>
    <desc lang="en">After successfully seeking out the ultimate slider in the 2004 stoner comedy Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle, the cannabis-craving twosome returns in this high-flying sequel that finds them labeled terrorists for attempting to sneak a marijuana-smoking implement on a flight to Amsterdam. Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) have just finished gorging themselves on savory White Castle hamburgers when they return to their apartment and hatch a plan for Harold to win the heart of his crush, Maria (Paula Garcés). Maria is going to Amsterdam, and if Harold can catch up with her overseas perhaps he can strike up a real love connection. After a close call with airport personnel and a chance encounter with Kumar's ex-girlfriend Vanessa (Danneel Harris) -- who hadn't yet told Kumar that she's engaged to be married -- the pot-loving pals finally board their flight for Amsterdam. Unfortunately for Harold, Kumar isn't able to endure the lengthy flight without an innocent puff or two from his smokeless bong. When the plane hits some turbulence and the bong is mistaken for a bomb, the flight is diverted to Guantanamo Bay and our spliff-smoking heroes are detained by overzealous Deputy Chief of Homeland Security Ron Fox (Rob Corddry). Now, if they can just escape from the world's most notorious prison compound, perhaps this hapless duo can succeed in convincing the authorities that they aren't enemy combatants, and that Kumar made the mistake of his life by letting Vanessa go. But before they can prove their innocence and get the girls, Harold and Kumar will have to outsmart the dreaded Ku Klux Klan, contend with a particularly precocious Cyclops baby, and successfully elude everyone's favorite debauched former child star -- Neil Patrick Harris(n)</desc>

Ultimately, the mother and daughter are able to relocate to an apartment, which, despite its excessively dilapidated interior, seems to be an adequate location for beginning a new life. Before long, however, what appears to be the spirit of a young girl begins to haunt them. No stranger to mental illness, the wary young woman brushes the visions aside as part of the inherent stress of making the transition from housewife to working, single mom. As time goes by and the apparent haunting does not subside, the apartment's new residents are forced to examine the history of its former tenants. Dark Water also features performances from John C. Reilly, Tim Roth, and Dougray Scott(n)</desc>

Having concluded their primary appeal is to caravanners, the duo spend a couple of days in models by Mazda and Volkswagen and try to get a feel for what life is like for the people they believe would buy one. Meanwhile, Richard Hammond drives a pair of exciting Lamborghinis in Italy - the ferocious Aventador Roadster and the limited-edition Sesto Elemento, which carries an eye-watering price tag of around £2million. Two cars are also put through their paces on the test track, with James in a modern re-creation of the classic Porsche 911 and Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler in the rather less exotic Reasonably Priced Car.(n)</desc>

Having concluded their primary appeal is to caravanners, the duo spend a couple of days in models by Mazda and Volkswagen and try to get a feel for what life is like for the people they believe would buy one. Meanwhile, Richard Hammond drives a pair of exciting Lamborghinis in Italy - the ferocious Aventador Roadster and the limited-edition Sesto Elemento, which carries an eye-watering price tag of around £2million. Two cars are also put through their paces on the test track, with James in a modern re-creation of the classic Porsche 911 and Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler in the rather less exotic Reasonably Priced Car.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Bernie Fineman and Mario Pacione return to seek out more classics in need of restoration, beginning with a Porsche 928 that has suffered from years of water damage. The car's bubbled paintwork, seized brakes and rusting nuts, bolts and screws seem bad enough, but it gets worse when the vehicle's complicated electrics go haywire and trap Mario inside. Once Bernie and his team of mechanics have serviced the engine, the car is taken to a rolling road to put it through its paces, before former racing driver Paul O'Neill assesses its value to see if all the work has been worthwhile.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Marvin's Room</title>
    <desc lang="en">Meryl Streep teams up with Titanic heart-throb Leonardo DiCaprio for this heartbreaking comedy-drama about a broken family. Estranged since their father's first stroke many years earlier, sisters Lee and Bessie now lead very different lives in separate states. Bessie, a spinster, has devoted her life to nursing her ailing father and caring for her dowdy aunt. By contrast, Lee is a selfish single parent with a lousy attitude and two mixed-up sons to show for it: teenager Hank is institutionalised after a deliberate attempt to burn his mother's house down and the wilfully invisible Charlie isn't much better. When Bessie's doctor informs her that she has leukaemia, she contacts her sister in the hope of finding a compatible bone marrow donor to save her life. After 20 years the sisters are reunited by anxiety and heartache at the home of their dying father Marvin. Hank is released from his asylum for a week to be tested as a possible donor for Bessie, the aunt he didn't know existed! As he and Bessie develop an unexpectedly sympathetic relationship, Lee and Bessie get to know each other all over again and rediscover the true meaning of family(n)</desc>

Raised on the mean streets of Cleveland, Greene's tough reputation eventually lands him a contact with the local mob. Before long, the scrappy local has become a mafia enforcer, but after forming an alliance with notorious gangster John Nardi (Vincent D'Onofrio) and burning feared loan shark Shondor Birns (Christopher Walken), Greene starts to discover that he has the potential to become as powerful as any of his adversaries. Later, Greene develops a reputation as untouchable after surviving numerous assassination attempts, and dealing a devastating blow to organized-crime syndicates across the U.S(n)</desc>

The film was based on the allegedly true story of the luckless Lutz family, who move lock, stock, and barrel into a new home, only to find that it is possessed by the demonic spirits of its previous owners. Variations of the Seven Deadly Plagues emanate from virtually every household fixture, while other forms of otherworldly mischief are suffered by the Lutz children. Enter kindly Father Delaney (Rod Steiger), who does his utmost to exorcise the house. The Amityville Horror was frequently greeted with laughs from its first-run audiences, especially after it was discovered that the "actual" events depicted in the film (based on a book by Jay Anson) were complete fabrications(n)</desc>

By the time the TV version of TMZ premiered the week of September 10, 2007, the operation had once again scooped its scandal-rag competition with its coverage of O.J.

Created in 2005, TMZ had gained national prominence by breaking the story of Mel Gibson's anti-Semitic tirade after his arrest for drunken driving. By the time the TV version of TMZ premiered the week of September 10, 2007, the operation had once again scooped its scandal-rag competition with its coverage of O.J. Simpson's profanity-laden "invasion" of the home of a collectibles dealer who was allegedly selling Simpson memorabilia without permission. In fact, TMZ on TV had a wealth of celebrity-meltdown yarns to choose from during its shakedown week, ranging from the substance-abuse problems of Lindsay Lohan to the ill-fated "comeback" concert of Britney Spears. Harvey Levin, managing editor for both versions of TMZ, appeared on-camera as a correspondent, along with Sean Borg, Michael Hundgen, Katie Darryl and Teresa Strasser.

    <title lang="en">Drumline</title>
    <desc lang="en">After decades of movies about college sports, the bands who take the field at halftime finally get their day in the sun in this musical comedy drama. Devon Miles (Nick Cannon) is a talented young percussionist from Harlem who wins a music scholarship to Atlanta A &amp; T, a prestigious African-American university. For years, Atlanta A &amp; T has won awards for their show-style marching band, who combine expert musicianship (incorporating funk, R&amp;B, and jazz rhythms into the traditional marching band repertoire) with choreography, dancing cheerleaders, and roof-raising showmanship. Dr. Aaron Lee (Orlando Jones), the school's band director, gives Devon a spot in the marching band's drumline, the heart and soul of a show-style band, but discovers Devon's previous musical education hardly meets his usual standard when he learns that his new drummer can't read music. Devon soon earns a reputation as a stubborn individualist within the band, not necessarily a good thing in an ensemble where a strictly unified performance is considers the ideal. Devon's cocksure attitude and streetwise style doesn't mesh very comfortably with Sean Taylor (Leonard Roberts), a disciplined senior who resents the presence of the upstart freshman in the drumline, and things become even less harmonious when Devon begins making a play for Laila (Zoe Saldana), a beautiful girl who is also being courted by Sean. Songwriter and record producer Dallas Austin, who has worked with Boyz II Men, TLC, and Pink, served as executive producer for Drumline, helped produce the film's musical score, and contributed his own experiences as a marching band member to the screenplay(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Drumline</title>
    <desc lang="en">After decades of movies about college sports, the bands who take the field at halftime finally get their day in the sun in this musical comedy drama. Devon Miles (Nick Cannon) is a talented young percussionist from Harlem who wins a music scholarship to Atlanta A &amp; T, a prestigious African-American university. For years, Atlanta A &amp; T has won awards for their show-style marching band, who combine expert musicianship (incorporating funk, R&amp;B, and jazz rhythms into the traditional marching band repertoire) with choreography, dancing cheerleaders, and roof-raising showmanship. Dr. Aaron Lee (Orlando Jones), the school's band director, gives Devon a spot in the marching band's drumline, the heart and soul of a show-style band, but discovers Devon's previous musical education hardly meets his usual standard when he learns that his new drummer can't read music. Devon soon earns a reputation as a stubborn individualist within the band, not necessarily a good thing in an ensemble where a strictly unified performance is considers the ideal. Devon's cocksure attitude and streetwise style doesn't mesh very comfortably with Sean Taylor (Leonard Roberts), a disciplined senior who resents the presence of the upstart freshman in the drumline, and things become even less harmonious when Devon begins making a play for Laila (Zoe Saldana), a beautiful girl who is also being courted by Sean. Songwriter and record producer Dallas Austin, who has worked with Boyz II Men, TLC, and Pink, served as executive producer for Drumline, helped produce the film's musical score, and contributed his own experiences as a marching band member to the screenplay(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">When the mother of a sniveling group of surly kids goes on a much-deserved summer vacation, she leaves her kids under the charge of an elderly distaff granny. But then granny has a heart attack, so the kids load her dead body in a trunk and deposit the package on the steps of the local funeral home. The kids are ecstatic thinking that with the big wad of cash Mom has left, they can have a summer of consumer madness. But when they find out that the money has been buried with the baby-sitter, the kids have to fend for themselves to make ends meet. Teen dream Sue Ellen (Christina Applegate) tries working at a fast food restaurant but she can't stand the grease. So, she puts together a false resume and, posing as a twenty-eight-year old, she applies for a job as a receptionist at a garment manufacturing company. The company vice president, Rose is so impressed by her resume that she hires her on the spot as her executive assistant. Her deception looks to be working out great -- Sue Ellen manages to hold off the office lady killer, avoids exposure by the embittered receptionist, borrows money from the company's petty cash box for household incidentals, and continues her relationship with restaurant employee Bryan (Josh Charles). But suddenly, the clothing firm is set to go under, and Sue Ellen must use her teen fashion sense to save the company and her job . . . and she has to get the rest of the brood involved.

    <title lang="en">Love Potion No. 9</title>
    <desc lang="en">When it comes to love, Paul Matthews and Diane Farrow, two highly educated and talented scientists don't know a thing. Looking at their geeky demeanor's it's easy to see why. Despite the fact that both are neighbors, share the same interests and both are psychobiologists who study primates, neither is really aware of the other romantically until Paul, who is terribly shy around women, goes to gypsy Madame Ruth in desperation and asks for help. She reads his palm and tells him that he needs a woman; she then hands him Love Potion No. 8 which will attract women like flies to honey. This romantic comedy chronicles what happens to him (and Diane) when, after experimenting on animals, they decide to try it on themselves. Though the changes only last four hours per dose, they are truly remarkable and the two agree to separate for three weeks and then come back together to compare results. The time passes quickly and wonderfully for them and when they finally reunite both have changed for the better. Just for fun, they decide to go out with each other. They do not drink the potion, but still have a wonderful and passionate night. This leads Paul to propose to Diane. Unfortunately, she thinks she loves another, a man who is really more interested in exploiting the potion for money than he is in her. He ends up buying up all of Madame Ruth's latest batch. Paul goes back to her and explains his problem and that is when Ruth hands him the potent Love Potion No. 9, which can manifest true love. Quickly, he takes it and sets off to find Diane before she makes a terrible mistake(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead</title>
    <desc lang="en">When the mother of a sniveling group of surly kids goes on a much-deserved summer vacation, she leaves her kids under the charge of an elderly distaff granny. But then granny has a heart attack, so the kids load her dead body in a trunk and deposit the package on the steps of the local funeral home. The kids are ecstatic thinking that with the big wad of cash Mom has left, they can have a summer of consumer madness. But when they find out that the money has been buried with the baby-sitter, the kids have to fend for themselves to make ends meet. Teen dream Sue Ellen (Christina Applegate) tries working at a fast food restaurant but she can't stand the grease. So, she puts together a false resume and, posing as a twenty-eight-year old, she applies for a job as a receptionist at a garment manufacturing company. The company vice president, Rose is so impressed by her resume that she hires her on the spot as her executive assistant. Her deception looks to be working out great -- Sue Ellen manages to hold off the office lady killer, avoids exposure by the embittered receptionist, borrows money from the company's petty cash box for household incidentals, and continues her relationship with restaurant employee Bryan (Josh Charles). But suddenly, the clothing firm is set to go under, and Sue Ellen must use her teen fashion sense to save the company and her job . . . and she has to get the rest of the brood involved. Watch out for a young David Duchovny in a small role(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Drumline</title>
    <desc lang="en">After decades of movies about college sports, the bands who take the field at halftime finally get their day in the sun in this musical comedy drama. Devon Miles (Nick Cannon) is a talented young percussionist from Harlem who wins a music scholarship to Atlanta A &amp; T, a prestigious African-American university. For years, Atlanta A &amp; T has won awards for their show-style marching band, who combine expert musicianship (incorporating funk, R&amp;B, and jazz rhythms into the traditional marching band repertoire) with choreography, dancing cheerleaders, and roof-raising showmanship. Dr. Aaron Lee (Orlando Jones), the school's band director, gives Devon a spot in the marching band's drumline, the heart and soul of a show-style band, but discovers Devon's previous musical education hardly meets his usual standard when he learns that his new drummer can't read music. Devon soon earns a reputation as a stubborn individualist within the band, not necessarily a good thing in an ensemble where a strictly unified performance is considers the ideal. Devon's cocksure attitude and streetwise style doesn't mesh very comfortably with Sean Taylor (Leonard Roberts), a disciplined senior who resents the presence of the upstart freshman in the drumline, and things become even less harmonious when Devon begins making a play for Laila (Zoe Saldana), a beautiful girl who is also being courted by Sean. Songwriter and record producer Dallas Austin, who has worked with Boyz II Men, TLC, and Pink, served as executive producer for Drumline, helped produce the film's musical score, and contributed his own experiences as a marching band member to the screenplay(n)</desc>

Semour "Sy" Parrish (Williams) runs the photo processing department at a large discount store; Sy is dedicated to his job, and takes great pride in his work. Sy's favorite customers are Nina and Will Yorkin (Connie Nielsen and Michael Vartan), an attractive and cheerful young couple with a nine-year-old boy, Jake (Dylan Smith). Sy dotes on the Yorkins and their son whenever they drop off film to be processed -- something they've been doing quite often ever since Jake was born -- and Nina and Will are indulgent of Sy's attentions, regarding his as a harmless eccentric. What the Yorkins don't know is Sy is a desperately lonely man with no real life of his own, and he's been obsessively making copies of their photos, for years, imagining himself to be "Uncle Sy," a member of the family. Sy's tenuous hold on reality begins to collapse when he develops a roll of film brought in by a new customer that suggests Will has been unfaithful to Nina; the notion that his ideal family may be falling apart is troubling enough for Sy, and when he loses his job, Sy reaches the breaking point.

    <title lang="en">Jennifer's Body</title>
    <desc lang="en">(2009) Megan Fox stars in director Karyn Kusama's (Girl Fight, Aeon Flux) horror satire, from a script by Juno writer Diablo Cody. Student Jennifer Check (Fox) is the stereotypical cheerleader: beautiful, bitchy and adored by all (other than those who are on the receiving end of her cruel wit) at her school in Devil's Kettle. However, local indie band Low Shoulder are more interested in her body than everyone else. In a bid to further their careers, they've made a pact with the Devil: one that requires the soul of a virgin. They kidnap and kill Jennifer, but unfortunately she was no virgin - and she rises again, as a literal man-eater, to take terrible retribution by ravenously rampaging her way through the school. Only one person stands a chance of halting the carnage: Jennifer's best friend Anita 'Needy' Lesnicky (Amanda Seyfried), who's nerdy, for sure, but also may have the strength of character to succeed where others have been ingested..(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">New series. As more people head to the high street rather than the GP in search of medical remedies, The Money Saving Good Health Show asks whether a price can be put on good health. Sian Williams investigate which products on the supermarket shelves are worth it, and Dr Ranj Singh tests a range of shop-bought cures, fads and remedies. The first edition is an hour-long diet special, in which six overweight volunteers are put through different off-the-shelf diets for 28 diets. But it's not just about who shifts the most weight - it's also about saving money, so the show will reveal how much each diet costs for every pound of weight they lose.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Hippo Has Landed. June has just begun, but the DeYoung Family Zoo, a privately owned zoo in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, is already well into its busy summer season. Bud and Carrie are always on the go and, on top of all their day-to-day chores, the zoo's largest new arrival is on its way from Jakarta, Indonesia. After an 11,000-mile journey, Wallace, a 400-pound baby hippo, is already proving to Bud and Carrie that he may be a kid, but he's calling all the shots! With a lot of coaxing and the help of some tasty carrots, the DeYoung Family Zoo finally welcomes its new hippo -- now Bud and Carrie just have to feed him! To add to the stress, Carrie has just started a no-kill animal rescue - Piper's Place - and is hoping that a fundraising event will bring in the money she needs. The balloons are up and the cake is cut, but can Carrie raise the thousands of dollars needed to keep Piper's Place afloat?(n)</desc>

Things really get tense with the arrival of distressing news: the cost to ship the hippo has gone up? a lot.

    <title lang="en">Winged Seduction: Birds of Paradise</title>
    <desc lang="en">National Geographic photographer Tim Laman and ornithologist Ed Scholes have spent the better part of a decade sleeping in tents and dangling from the rain forest canopy to document all 39 species of Birds of Paradise. Their mission takes them into the jungles of one of last wild places on earth, New Guinea - where children carry machetes, women carry heavy loads and men carry on tribal warfare. Far-flung islands, impenetrable jungle and extreme elevations all create areas of isolation where ordinary birds have evolved into some of the most beautifully bizarre species on earth. Tim and Ed's first quarry on this expedition is Goldie's Bird of Paradise - a dazzling color-shaker that attracts females with a mating dance done in pairs. Rough seas, a flooded island and inaccurate scouting all stand in their way, but Tim and Ed make natural history filmmaking history by capturing a Goldie display with a remote controlled camouflaged camera. After a wild flight into the Huon Mountains, they search out Wahne's Parotia, a shape-shifter that transforms from bird to a feathered man in a skirt. Tim and Ed are after a scientific first - filming the Parotia from the female's perspective. Feathers that look like a skirt from the side, look like an oval from above, where the female audience members sit - no human has ever filmed it before. Digital explorers on an old-fashioned quest, Tim and Ed have survived everything the jungle has to throw at them to become first in the world to capture all 39 species of Birds of Paradise(n)</desc>

Their mission takes them into the jungles of one of last wild places on earth, New Guinea - where children carry machetes, women carry heavy loads and men carry on tribal warfare. Far-flung islands, impenetrable jungle and extreme elevations all create areas of isolation where ordinary birds have evolved into some of the most beautifully bizarre species on earth. Tim and Ed's first quarry on this expedition is Goldie's Bird of Paradise - a dazzling color-shaker that attracts females with a mating dance done in pairs. Rough seas, a flooded island and inaccurate scouting all stand in their way, but Tim and Ed make natural history filmmaking history by capturing a Goldie display with a remote controlled camouflaged camera. After a wild flight into the Huon Mountains, they search out Wahne's Parotia, a shape-shifter that transforms from bird to a feathered man in a skirt. Tim and Ed are after a scientific first - filming the Parotia from the female's perspective. Feathers that look like a skirt from the side, look like an oval from above, where the female audience members sit - no human has ever filmed it before. Digital explorers on an old-fashioned quest, Tim and Ed have survived everything the jungle has to throw at them to become first in the world to capture all 39 species of Birds of Paradise(n)</desc>

They stumble across a scrap of land in north London, but it's fraught with problems and the only way they can complete the £1million home is by sinking half of it six metres below ground.

    <title lang="en">Shadow Zone: The Undead Express</title>
    <desc lang="en">A horror semi-parody targeted at the young adult market that ravenously gobbles up horror books like R.L. Stine's Goosebumps series, this made-for-TV vampire tale stars Chauncey Leopardi as Zach, a teenage rebel with a flair for telling ghost stories, who stumbles on an underground cabal of vampires when he takes a fateful ride on a New York subway. The vampire's leader, Valentine (Ron Silver), proposes a deal to young Zach, offering him safe passage to the world above, thus enabling the trapped vampire -- who can only mingle with humanity through the willing assistance of an innocent youth -- to reach the surface as well. Our young hero balks at this idea and escapes to the surface with a wild story for his skeptical pals, who shun him until one of their number is kidnapped by the undead subway dwellers in exchange for Zach's cooperation. Though atmospherically photographed, this low-budget production is a bit too corny to provide either laughs or chills, and it suffers further from lethargic pacing(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Tenderness</title>
    <desc lang="en">Adapted from the novel by Robert Cormier, this psychological crime drama tells the tense story of an obsessed police lieutenant who's on the hunt for a dangerous young killer. The first thing most people notice about handsome high school student Eric Komenko (Jon Foster) is his easy charm. But that charm doesn't run deep, because a closer look reveals a cold-blooded killer. When Eric's devoutly religious mother discovers that her son has been sleeping around, the teen responds to her maternal scolding by viciously slaughtering both she and his father. The man assigned to Eric's case, Lt. Cristofuoro (Russell Crowe), believes that the young psychopath will kill again if given the opportunity. Lt. Cristofuoro knows that Eric has had a rough life, but he's determined to catch him before his murderous impulses once again take over. As Eric hits the road to Syracuse in search of a girl he met in juvenile detention, he is surprised to find Lori Cranston hiding in his truck. A tragic victim of sexual abuse, Lori knows what Eric is capable of, yet remains steadfast in her devotion to him. The crueler Eric is to Lori, the more she desires him. Later, as Lt. Cristofuoro closes in on the pair, Lori embraces her fate as Eric's next victim, and gives herself to him without struggle. But Eric is more interested in the girl from juvenile detention than he is with Lori. Little does the young killer realize that he's walking straight into a carefully set trap(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In this romantic comedy, a writer finds out the hard way about the consequences of walking a fine line between fiction and real life. Harper (Taye Diggs) is an author whose first novel is soon to be published, just as he's been asked to be Best Man at the wedding of his friends Lance (Morris Chestnut) and Mia (Monica Calhoun). Harper is suffering a worse case of publication-day jitters than most authors, and with good reason: much of his book has been drawn from real life, and he's afraid that his friends and family will spot the sometimes unflattering literary versions of themselves. What's worse, Mia and Harper had a fling years ago, and their affair made it into the book; Lance doesn't know, and Harper would just as soon he didn't find out before the wedding. But one of the bridesmaids, Jordan (Nia Long), has gotten hold of an advance copy of the book. Since Jordan works as a television journalist and devotes her life to digging up dirt on people, Harper is convinced that she'll spill the beans and spoil his friends' big day. The Best Man was the debut film for writer/director Malcolm D. Lee; Spike Lee served as producer(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Profile of rock superstar Meat Loaf. Since the release of the Bat Out of Hell album in 1977, Meat Loaf has possessed the kind of international status that few artists obtain. His larger-than-life persona and performances are fuelled by a passion for theatre and storytelling. This candid profile reveals the man and his music through his own testimony and from the accounts of those closest to him. Meat Loaf's life story is one of epic proportions - he survived a childhood of domestic violence only to face years of record company rejection, before eventually finding global fame. Along the way he experienced bankruptcy, health scares, bust-ups and one of the greatest comebacks of all time. All this and more is explored in the film, which features behind-the-scenes footage of his recent Las Vegas residency, plus plans for a new album featuring songs by Jim Steinman(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Gone in 60 Seconds</title>
    <desc lang="en">In this action thriller, a master car thief has his skills pushed to the limit. Randall "Memphis" Raines (Nicolas Cage) can steal practically any car that crosses his path. While he has done well in his life of crime, he knows that there's a short future in theft, and he wants to get out of the business. But his retirement plans are interrupted when his younger brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) gets in trouble with a dangerous crime boss. To get his brother out of harm's way, Randall agrees to a profitable but risky scheme to steal 50 luxury cars in one night, with the help of several other car thieves, including Sara "Sway" Wayland (Angelina Jolie). A rival group of thieves is trying to pull the same stunt at the same time, and detectives Castlebeck (Delroy Lindo) and Drycoff (Timothy Olyphant) are trying to shut down both operations. Also starring Robert Duvall as Otto Halliwell, and Scott Caan as Tumbler, Gone in Sixty Seconds is a remake of the 1974 low-budget action hit of the same name, best remembered for a 40-minute chase scene in which 90 cars were destroyed(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">A Simple Plan</title>
    <desc lang="en">Based on Scott B. Smith's bone-chilling 1993 novel, A Simple Plan is a bit of a departure for horror film director Sam Raimi. Instead of flying eyeballs and dancing corpses, A Simple Plan is a taut crime thriller in the vein of Joel Coen's Academy Award-winning Fargo. Set during the white winters of Minnesota, this story tells the eerie tale of Hank and Jacob Mitchell (played by Bill Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton) who, along with a buddy, find a downed single-engine plane buried in the snowy woods. Inside it is a decaying pilot and a bag carrying four million dollars in one-hundred-dollar bills. The men decide to hide the money until spring when the snow is melted and the plane is found. If no one notices the missing money at that time, they will split it and live a wealthy new life. A simple plan, right? Wrong. Much like Humphrey Bogart's The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, things can only get worse, as distrust and greed creep into the minds of the principals. They find it difficult to decide which one gets to hold the money -- and even more impossible to keep from dipping into the stash until spring. And so on. It also becomes increasingly tough to keep a secret of this magnitude. And if all this doesn't get moviegoers' brains working, it seems there are suspicious characters in town who just may be able to link them to the plane, forcing the more dangerous and bloody question of what to do with those people and how to cover their tracks(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Dark Girls</title>
    <desc lang="en">When Africans were first brought to the United States as slaves, many slave owners took a strange approach to diving the labor among the humans they owned -- lighter skinned blacks were assigned to work inside the house, performing more precise but less physically demanding chores, while their darker skinned brethren were forced to perform punishing manual labor in the fields. In the 21st Century, a grim vestige of this tradition lives on in African-American culture, as women with dark complexion often find themselves looked down upon by their peers, considered less attractive, less intelligent and less refined than women with a lighter skin tone. A variety of African-American women discuss this phenomenon, sharing their thoughts on the social and cultural implications of this subtle but common form of prejudice, in the documentary Dark Girls. Directors Bill Duke and D. Channsin Berry feature interviews with women sharing their own experiences as dark skinned African-Americans, children who reveal how young these beliefs are implanted in girls, and men who share their feelings about women and skin color. Dark Girls was an official selection at the 2011 Toronto Film Festival(n)</desc>

The trouble is, boys aren't all that interested in Mary Catherine, especially not Sky (Will Ferrell), the boy she'd most like to be kissed by. So Mary Catherine has a goal: if she wants to be kissed the way boys kiss girls in the movies, then she must become a movie star. Not a bad idea, but how does one bring this about?

    <title lang="en">Millions</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Danny Boyle revisits a theme from his Shallow Grave and Trainspotting days -- greed -- but focuses on a much younger protagonist with this comedy drama. Millions opens with recent widower Ronnie (James Nesbitt) moving his two precocious pre-pubescent sons to the suburbs. Missing his mother and the comforts of his old neighborhood, the young Damian (Alex Etel) builds a cardboard-box fort on the outskirts of the suburb, where one day his placid introvert existence is literally crushed by a giant gym bag full of thousands of pounds' worth of cash. Less concerned with the origin of the money than with how to spend it, Damian and his older brother, Anthony (Lewis McGibbon), decide to keep it a secret from their father, which becomes an increasingly tricky proposition as the days pass. His conscience getting in the way of his spending, Damian debates the ethics of his ill-gotten gains with a handful of imaginary saints, and begins to try to spend his cash a little more altruistically. But his charitable deeds inadvertently attract the attention of a mysterious, threatening man who's desperate to get his hands on the money. Marking a distinct change of pace for Boyle after the horror film 28 Days Later, Millions world-premiered at the 2004 Toronto Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">CJ7</title>
    <desc lang="en">Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle director Stephen Chow returns to the helm for this sci-fi comedy about a struggling single father whose quest to find the perfect toy yields out-of-this-world results. Ti (Chow) is a poor construction worker who breaks his back to ensure that his young son Dicky (Xu Jiao) can stay enrolled in an exclusive private school. But while Ti does everything possible to give his son the opportunities that he never had, Dicky still feels like a classroom reject due to his tattered clothes and lack of the latest toys. Dicky's classmates all play with the coolest and most expensive gadgets that money can buy, so how is a kid who gets his toys from the local junkyard ever supposed to fit in? One day, while scrounging through the trash heap in search of a new toy, Ti discovers a mysterious orb and brings it straight back to Dicky. Though at first the "CJ7" appears to be little more than an unidentifiable oddity, it proves to be much, much more once the young boy starts to play with it. This isn't your average action figure, but a living "pet" with extraordinary powers. Realizing that his new toy may be just the thing to help him fit in with his demanding classmates, Dicky brings the CJ7 to school with him in order to show it off and have some fun. But the CJ7 has its own ideas about how to have fun, and it isn't long before the situation at school gets hopelessly out of hand(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Trumpet of the Swan</title>
    <desc lang="en">E.B. White's children's story of a swan searching for his voice comes to life in this animated adventure. When young Louie the Swan is hatched, it's soon discovered that he isn't able to make a sound, which is a matter of no small annoyance to his boastful father (voice of Jason Alexander) and doting mother (voice of Mary Steenburgen). As Louie gets a bit older, he falls in love with Serena (voice of Reese Witherspoon), but he has no way of telling her how he feels. Despondent, Louie flies away, and makes friends with a young boy named Sam (voice of Sam Gifaldi). Sam realizes Louie has a problem, and with the help of his schoolteacher, Mrs. Hammerbotham (Carol Burnett), Louie learns to read and write. Louie is thrilled that he has finally found a way to communicate, but his joy is short-lived when he discovers his fellow swans are not well acquainted with the English language. At long last, Louie finds a way to speak in a way his family and fellows can understand when his father gives him a trumpet; while Louie is thrilled and shows a remarkable gift for the instrument, his dad's happiness is diluted by the fact that the horn is stolen merchandise. Determined to pay for the stolen trumpet and make his family proud, Louie flies away to the big city, where he lands a lucrative gig playing with a jazz combo. At last, Louie has found fame, fortune, and self-respect, but can he win the heart of Serena away from her fiancé, Boyd (Seth Green)? The score for The Trumpet of the Swan was written by noted jazz artist Marcus Miller; rock &amp; roll pioneer Little Richard also contributed a song to the soundtrack(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Millions</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Danny Boyle revisits a theme from his Shallow Grave and Trainspotting days -- greed -- but focuses on a much younger protagonist with this comedy drama. Millions opens with recent widower Ronnie (James Nesbitt) moving his two precocious pre-pubescent sons to the suburbs. Missing his mother and the comforts of his old neighborhood, the young Damian (Alex Etel) builds a cardboard-box fort on the outskirts of the suburb, where one day his placid introvert existence is literally crushed by a giant gym bag full of thousands of pounds' worth of cash. Less concerned with the origin of the money than with how to spend it, Damian and his older brother, Anthony (Lewis McGibbon), decide to keep it a secret from their father, which becomes an increasingly tricky proposition as the days pass. His conscience getting in the way of his spending, Damian debates the ethics of his ill-gotten gains with a handful of imaginary saints, and begins to try to spend his cash a little more altruistically. But his charitable deeds inadvertently attract the attention of a mysterious, threatening man who's desperate to get his hands on the money. Marking a distinct change of pace for Boyle after the horror film 28 Days Later, Millions world-premiered at the 2004 Toronto Film Festival(n)</desc>
