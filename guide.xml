    <title lang="en">Capote</title>
    <desc lang="en">The creation of one of the most memorable books of the 1960s -- and the impact the writing and research would have on its author -- is explored in this drama based on a true story. In 1959, Truman Capote (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman) was a critically acclaimed novelist who had earned a small degree of celebrity for his work when he read a short newspaper item about a multiple murder in a small Kansas town. For some reason, the story fascinated Capote, and he asked William Shawn (Bob Balaban), his editor at The New Yorker, to let him write a piece about the case. Capote had long believed that in the right hands, a true story could be molded into a tale as compelling as any fiction, and he believed this event, in which the brutal and unimaginable was visited upon a community where it was least expected, could be just the right material. Capote traveled to Kansas with his close friend Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), herself becoming a major literary figure with the success of To Kill a Mockingbird, and while Capote's effete and mannered personal style stuck out like a sore thumb in Kansas, in time he gained the trust of Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper), the Kansas Bureau of Investigation agent investigating the murder of the Clutter family, and with his help Capote's magazine piece grew into a full-length book. Capote also became familiar with the petty criminals who killed the Clutter family, Dick Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) and Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.), and in Smith he found a troubling kindred spirit more like himself than he wanted to admit. After attaining a sort of friendship with Smith under the assumption that the man would be executed before the book was ever published, Capote finds himself forced to directly confront the moral implications of his actions with regards to both his role in the man's death, and the way that he would be remembered. Capote also co-stars Bruce Greenwood as Capote's longtime companion Jack Dunphy, and Amy Ryan as Mary Dewey, Alvin's wife who became a confidante of Capote's(n)</desc>

Fish has spent the past two decades languishing at soul-crushing day jobs while his old bandmates became legends, continuing to grace magazine covers and dominate the radio. He might just get another chance at musical success, however, when his teenage cousin invites him to drum for his high school garage band, and they end up catching the ear of record executives. Now, Fish is determined to live the hedonistic rock &amp; roll lifestyle he missed out on 20 years ago, but his new bandmates don't appreciate his hard partying -- and neither do his middle-aged knees.

    <title lang="en">Daredevil</title>
    <desc lang="en">Mark Steven Johnson's violent superhero fantasy-morality play stars Ben Affleck as Matt Murdock, a guilt-wracked blind vigilante with a penchant for red leather. During his childhood, an accident involving toxic waste blinded Murdock, but it also enhanced his other senses and gave him a kind of 'radar vision'. The incident was partially caused by his discovery that his father was involved with the Mob. Now, the adult Murdock, spurred partly by Catholic guilt over his role in his father's death, has dedicated this life to fighting crime and protecting the innocent. By day Murdock's a defence lawyer, but by night he dispenses summary justice to criminals who've escaped the courts. Things get complicated when he falls in love with Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner). Not only is she the daughter of a man with connections to New York crime bosses but, unknown to Murdock, she's also a vigilante who's equally keen on figure-hugging leather (black in her case). And when Daredevil is framed for the murder of her father, Elektra swears vengeance on the masked crime-fighter (not realising that he's her lover). Meanwhile, both of them are in mortal danger from the actual killer, a merciless Irish assassin called Bullseye (Colin Farrell)(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Conan the Barbarian</title>
    <desc lang="en">John Milius's jingoistic direction and pulpy screenplay fit perfectly into this film version of the Robert E. Howard fantasy story of the sword and sorcery hero, Conan the Barbarian. Complementing Mulius's heavy metal production is Arnold Schwarzenegger's leaden acting, which in any other context would be deadly, but here (as in The Terminator) corresponds nicely with the whole sonorous project. The story begins when a horde of rampaging warriors massacre the parents of young Conan and enslave the young child for years on The Wheel of Pain. The Wheel of Pain seems to have as its only purpose the building up of Conan's muscles, so it's no surprise that one day Conan grows up to become Arnold Schwarzenegger. As the sole survivor of the childhood massacre, Conan is released from slavery and taught the ancient arts of fighting. Transforming himself into a killing machine, Conan travels into the wilderness to seek vengeance on Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones), the man responsible for killing his family. In the wilderness, Conan takes up with the thieves Valeria (Sandahl Bergman) and Subota (Gerry Lopez). The trio comes upon a weird snake cult, linked to Doom, and Conan wants to trek off to Doom's mountain retreat to kill him. But he is prevented from doing that by King Osrik (Max Von Sydow), who wants the trio of warriors to help rescue his daughter who has joined Doom in the hills(n)</desc>

Miguel Santos is a talented pitcher who might just have what it takes to earn a prized spot on a Major League Baseball team, but before that happens he'll have to prove his worth in the minor leagues. Advancing into the United States' minor league system at the tender age of 19, Miguel is warmly welcomed into the small-town Iowa home of his host family, but can't help but struggle with language and cultural barriers despite the kindness of strangers. Subsequently forced to reevaluate his life's ambition after his once-trusty arm becomes unreliable, the previously single-minded pitcher gradually begins to question both the world he lives in and the role he has chosen to play in it(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Mark Steven Johnson's violent superhero fantasy-morality play stars Ben Affleck as Matt Murdock, a guilt-wracked blind vigilante with a penchant for red leather. During his childhood, an accident involving toxic waste blinded Murdock, but it also enhanced his other senses and gave him a kind of 'radar vision'. The incident was partially caused by his discovery that his father was involved with the Mob. Now, the adult Murdock, spurred partly by Catholic guilt over his role in his father's death, has dedicated this life to fighting crime and protecting the innocent. By day Murdock's a defence lawyer, but by night he dispenses summary justice to criminals who've escaped the courts. Things get complicated when he falls in love with Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner). Not only is she the daughter of a man with connections to New York crime bosses but, unknown to Murdock, she's also a vigilante who's equally keen on figure-hugging leather (black in her case). And when Daredevil is framed for the murder of her father, Elektra swears vengeance on the masked crime-fighter (not realising that he's her lover). Meanwhile, both of them are in mortal danger from the actual killer, a merciless Irish assassin called Bullseye (Colin Farrell)(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The One Show presenter Alex Jones and business journalist Steph McGovern take on a mission to help families change the way they shop without changing their lifestyles. They begin in Glasgow, where Colin and Karen Rodger dream of taking their three sets of twins abroad for the first time. However, they are big spenders, with Karen's shoe addiction rubbing off onto the children, while Colin opts for only the very best when it comes to gadgets. To help them save money, they have their branded products replaced with substitutes, and also test cheaper vacuums and washing detergents. Will they be able to change their spendthrift ways?.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Terminator</title>
    <desc lang="en">Endlessly imitated, The Terminator made the reputation of cowriter/director James Cameron -- who would go on to make 1997's titanic Titanic -- and solidified the stardom of Arnold Schwarzenegger. The movie begins in a post-apocalyptic 2029, when Los Angeles has been largely reduced to rubble and is under the thumb of all-powerful ruling machines. Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), a member of the human resistance movement, is teleported back to 1984. His purpose: to rescue Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), the mother of the man who will lead the 21st-century rebels against the tyrannical machines, from being assassinated before she can give birth. Likewise thrust back to 1984 is The Terminator (Schwarzenegger), a grim, well-armed, virtually indestructable cyborg who has been programmed to eliminate Sarah Connor. After killing two "Sarah Connors" who turn out to be the wrong women, he finally aims his gunsights at the genuine article. This is the film in which Schwarzenegger declared "I'll be baaaack" -- and back he was, in "kinder and gentler" form, in the even more successful Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)(n)</desc>

From a nexus deep within the Justice Department's elite Precrime Unit, all the evidence to convict - from imagery alluding to the time, place and other details - is seen by Pre-Cogs, three psychic beings whose visions of murder have never been wrong. It is the nation's most advanced crime force, a perfect system. And no-one works harder for Precrime than its top man, Chief John Anderton. Destroyed by a tragic loss, Anderton has thrown all of his passion into a system that could potentially spare thousands of people from the tragedy he lived through. Six years later, the coming vote to take it national has only fuelled his conviction that Precrime works. Anderton has no reason to doubt it... until he becomes its #1 suspect(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Endlessly imitated, The Terminator made the reputation of cowriter/director James Cameron -- who would go on to make 1997's titanic Titanic -- and solidified the stardom of Arnold Schwarzenegger. The movie begins in a post-apocalyptic 2029, when Los Angeles has been largely reduced to rubble and is under the thumb of all-powerful ruling machines. Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), a member of the human resistance movement, is teleported back to 1984. His purpose: to rescue Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), the mother of the man who will lead the 21st-century rebels against the tyrannical machines, from being assassinated before she can give birth. Likewise thrust back to 1984 is The Terminator (Schwarzenegger), a grim, well-armed, virtually indestructable cyborg who has been programmed to eliminate Sarah Connor. After killing two "Sarah Connors" who turn out to be the wrong women, he finally aims his gunsights at the genuine article. This is the film in which Schwarzenegger declared "I'll be baaaack" -- and back he was, in "kinder and gentler" form, in the even more successful Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)(n)</desc>

From a nexus deep within the Justice Department's elite Precrime Unit, all the evidence to convict - from imagery alluding to the time, place and other details - is seen by Pre-Cogs, three psychic beings whose visions of murder have never been wrong. It is the nation's most advanced crime force, a perfect system. And no-one works harder for Precrime than its top man, Chief John Anderton. Destroyed by a tragic loss, Anderton has thrown all of his passion into a system that could potentially spare thousands of people from the tragedy he lived through. Six years later, the coming vote to take it national has only fuelled his conviction that Precrime works. Anderton has no reason to doubt it... until he becomes its #1 suspect(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Crime of Passion: The Pamela Smart Story. Youth, seduction, and violence populate the landscape of the A&amp;E program American Justice: Crimes of Passion -- The Pamela Smart Story. As an attractive motivated schoolteacher, Pam Smart was carving out a successful middle-class life. But, inwardly, she was passionately dissatisfied. Her husband held her back, yet she couldn't afford to live alone. Then, Smart met teenager Bill Flynn. He fell for her and she seemed flattered by the attention. Eventually, their relationship became intimate and Smart found the answer to all her problems. Through manipulation and claims of abuse, she convinced her young lover to kill her husband and that's just what he did with the help of two friends. But, Smart's calculating manner gave her away when police suspected her of being less than grief-stricken. What followed was the first live broadcast trial in history. The media explosion surrounding the case was unparalleled. Smart turned out to be a lot less organized than she thought. When her killers caved and word got around of her arranged hit, she was doomed. A&amp;E takes the viewer back to the original trial of the century(n)</desc>

Juliane Koepcke, meanwhile, tells of being lost for 10 days in the Peruvian rainforest after a plane crash in 1971, and how her knowledge of jungle terrain helped to save her life.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Tom Welles (Nicolas Cage) is a surveillance expert on the rise. He's living the American dream with a wife, Amy (Catherine Keener), infant daughter, and a house in the suburbs of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. After the completion of an assignment for a U.S. Senator, Welles is summoned to the house of a recently deceased captain of industry. His widow, in settling his estate, has discovered an 8MM film in her late husband's private safe. The silent short depicts the apparent murder of a young woman by a large, masked figure, what is known as a "snuff" film. Greatly disturbed by the film's contents, the widow hires Welles to find the identity of the woman and determine if she is still alive. Welles finds the girl's identity and follows her trail from the time she ran away from home to Hollywood. Once there, Welles meets adult bookstore clerk Max California (Joaquin Phoenix) to act as Virgil to Welles' Dante. As the two begin their descent into the world of underground pornography, the detective grows more and more distant from his family, as if he cannot shake the taint of the world in which he now walks. Tom and Max eventually meet pornographers Dino Velvet (Peter Stormare) and Eddie Poole (James Gandolfini). By this time the detective finds he can no longer walk out of the inferno(n)</desc>

The film opens with Godzilla waking up from his underwater hideaway. Unseen since his 1954 attack on Tokyo, the monster is spotted by a Japanese submarine. Though government officials seem reluctant to confront the problem, Navy Admiral Tachibana (Ryudo Uzaki), who witnessed the rampage when he was a child, is more than a little alarmed. Meanwhile, Tachibana's daughter Yuri (Chiharu Niiyama), who works at a struggling TV station, is making a documentary in the mountains of Niigata Prefecture. One night, they experience a massive earthquake and that next morning they learn that a gang of motorcycle punks were crushed in a mountain tunnel and witnesses reportedly saw some sort of fire-breathing creature in the rubble. Later, a group of campers in southern Kagoshima prefecture are crushed by some Thing that crawled out of Lake Ikeda. Soon Japan is awash with monsters -- including Baradon, a monster that looks like a pug terrier with Mickey Mouse ears, and King Gidora, a three-headed beast with a lethal 50-meter tail -- busting up things north, south, east, and west(n)</desc>

Comic books may come and go, but every red-blooded boy in Springfield loves "Radioactive Man," and Bart Simpson (voice of Nancy Cartwright) is no exception. When Bart discovers the local comics shop, The Android's Dungeon, has a copy of the very rare first issue of "Radioactive Man," he's desperate to have it. Unfortunately, the comic is going for $100, and Bart only has $35 in his savings. Bart tries asking his parents for the money, looking under couch cushions, and (gasp!) even doing odd jobs for elderly Mrs. Glick (voice of Cloris Leachman), but he's still far short of the asking price, so Bart pools his finances with Milhouse (voice of Cartwright) and Martin (voice of Russi Taylor) and they buy the comic together. However, the three boys soon argue over who will get to keep the book, leading to an ugly scene in Bart's tree house. Daniel Stern also joins the voice cast in a brief parody of his narration of the TV series The Wonder Years. "Three Men and a Comic Book" first aired on May 9, 1991(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Bart's Friend Falls in Love</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Bart's Friend Falls in Love. Bart Simpson (voice of Nancy Cartwright) is used to spending much of his time with his best friend Milhouse (voice of Pamela Hayden), but that begins to change when a new girl moves to town, Samantha Stanky (voice of Kimmy Robertson). Samantha is in the same class as Bart and Milhouse, and it doesn't take long for Milhouse to develop a serious crush on her -- and for Samantha to make clear she's also fond of Milhouse. Bart, who still appears to be stuck in the "girls are yucky" stage, doesn't understand Milhouse's infatuation with Samantha, and when he discovers he's not only brought a girl to their tree house, but is kissing her as well, Bart decides its time to break up this romance before it can spread. Meanwhile, Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) orders a subliminal weight-loss tape in hopes of getting her hubby, Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta), to drop a few pounds. But Homer receives a "Increase Your Vocabulary" instead, and while he continues to gain weight, when he speaks, he suddenly sounds like a walking thesaurus. "Bart's Friend Falls in Love" first aired on May 7, 1992(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A Streetcar Named Marge. Looking for something to break the monotony of her life as a housewife, Marge Simpson (voice of Julie Kavner) auditions for the Springfield Community Center's upcoming production of Streetcar! -- a musical adaptation of A Streetcar Named Desire. The director, melodramatic Llewllyn Sinclair (voice of Jon Lovitz), isn't impressed at first by Marge's audition, but after hearing her talk to Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta), he's convinced she's just the woman to play Blanche DuBois opposite Ned Flanders (voice of Harry Shearer), who was cast because he looks better with his shirt off than anyone else who tried out. Homer doesn't think much of Marge's new interest in theater, and her anger at her husband gives her performance a keen emotional edge, but will this rift in their marriage prove irreparable? Meanwhile, since Marge is busy with rehearsals, she sends baby Maggie to a daycare center, the Ayn Rand School for Tots, where the staff is determined to keep the children away from their pacifiers; Maggie, however, isn't about to give it up without a fight. A Streetcar Named Marge first aired on October 1, 1992(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Radioactive Man. Hollywood moguls and comic book fans everywhere are abuzz over the news that Radioactive Man is to be adapted into a major motion picture, and observers are surprised by two bits of news concerning the project -- Teutonic action star Rainier Wolfcastle (voice of Harry Shearer) has been cast in the title role, and the producers have chosen to shoot the entire film on location in Springfield. Bart Simpson (voice of Nancy Cartwright), an ardent Radioactive Man fan, hears there will be an open call to find a young actor to play youthful sidekick "Fallout Boy," and considers himself a cinch to win the role. However, the part instead goes to Bart's close friend Milhouse (voice of Pamela Hayden), who isn't even certain he wants it. Milhouse's dissatisfaction with his new stardom grows, and one day he disappears; Bart sets out to find him and convince him not to pass up the chance of a lifetime. Meanwhile, Mayor Quimby (voice of Dan Castellaneta) busies himself by creating a wide variety of new taxes to levy against the film's production team. "Radioactive Man" also features a cameo by Mickey Rooney, who plays himself trying to convince Milhouse to finish the film; the episode first aired on September 24, 1995(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Former Saturday Night Live "Weekend Update" co-anchors Tina Fey and Amy Poehler co-star in this baby-fever comedy about a single, career-oriented woman who previously put parenthood on hold, and is forced to hire a surrogate mother when she discovers there is only a one-in-a-million chance that she will be able to get pregnant. Kate Holbrook (Fey) is a 37-year-old business executive who has always put her professional life before her personal life, but these days her biological clock is ticking louder than ever before. As with everything else she has accomplished in life, Kate is determined to have a child on her own terms. Unfortunately for Kate, the chance of her ever becoming pregnant is slim to none. Undaunted, a willful Kate drafts South Philly working-class girl Angie Ostrowiski (Poehler) -- a woman who may just be her polar opposite -- to be a surrogate mother. Subsequently informed by the head of the surrogacy center (Sigourney Weaver) that her surrogate is indeed pregnant, the excited mother-to-be soon purchases every child-rearing book she can find and excitedly begins the nesting process. But life hasn't quit throwing Kate curveballs just yet, because when a pregnant Angie shows up on her doorstep with no place to live, the woman who once thrived on order finds her life descending into chaos. Now, as Kate attempts to transform Angie into the ideal expectant mother, this odd couple will discover that families aren't always biological, but occasionally formed through friendship as well. Writer Michael McCullers, who authored the screenplays for Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and Undercover Brother in addition to working on Saturday Night Live, makes his feature directorial debut with a self-penned screenplay(n)</desc>

Kate Holbrook (Fey) is a 37-year-old business executive who has always put her professional life before her personal life, but these days her biological clock is ticking louder than ever before. As with everything else she has accomplished in life, Kate is determined to have a child on her own terms. Unfortunately for Kate, the chance of her ever becoming pregnant is slim to none. Undaunted, a willful Kate drafts South Philly working-class girl Angie Ostrowiski (Poehler) -- a woman who may just be her polar opposite -- to be a surrogate mother. Subsequently informed by the head of the surrogacy center (Sigourney Weaver) that her surrogate is indeed pregnant, the excited mother-to-be soon purchases every child-rearing book she can find and excitedly begins the nesting process. But life hasn't quit throwing Kate curveballs just yet, because when a pregnant Angie shows up on her doorstep with no place to live, the woman who once thrived on order finds her life descending into chaos. Now, as Kate attempts to transform Angie into the ideal expectant mother, this odd couple will discover that families aren't always biological, but occasionally formed through friendship as well. Writer Michael McCullers, who authored the screenplays for Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and Undercover Brother in addition to working on Saturday Night Live, makes his feature directorial debut with a self-penned screenplay(n)</desc>

Written by Anderson and friend Owen Wilson (an actor in Armageddon and Anaconda), they created the story of Max Fischer, a highly eccentric 15-year-old boy who attends the tenth grade at Rushmore Academy. Played by Jason Schwartzman (Talia Shire's son and Francis Ford Coppola's nephew), Max is a poor student with big dreams and a love of extracurricular activities. Max is editor of the school newspaper and yearbook, president of the chess, astronomy, French, and German clubs, captain of the fencing team, and director of the school play. Max is also a compulsive liar, telling everyone that his barber father (Seymour Cassel) is really a brain surgeon. Suddenly Max falls in love with Miss Cross (Olivia Williams), a first-grade teacher at the school. He also makes a new friend in business tycoon Mr. Blume (Bill Murray), an eccentric millionaire who also loves Miss Cross. The love triangle heats up as Max refuses to believe that his age has anything to do with Miss Cross refusing his romantic advances. Also Max's scheme to erect an aquarium on the school baseball diamond gets him booted out of Rushmore Academy. As his life crumbles around him, he is forced to grow up and accept the consequences of his actions and his lies. He throws himself more into his extracurricular activities, hoping to redeem himself by staging the most ambitious school play ever attempted(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">King Ralph</title>
    <desc lang="en">Sometimes a family title, among the nobility of England, goes to the "collateral" heirs -- people not in the direct line of decent, like cousins, great-nephews and the like. On rare occasions, these people are not even aware that they are about to be elevated to the House of Lords, and they have been living more-or-less ordinary lives. In this comedy, the family which lacks direct heirs is the Royal Family of England -- as all of the likely heirs have died one after the other in swift succession. In this comedy, the "collateral heir" is an exuberant, fence-busting All-American slob (and pretty good rock n' roll musician) by the name of Ralph (John Goodman). Unknown to him, his grandmother had an affair with a royal prince. Ralph's a good guy, and eager to please. He recognizes the importance of the royal hoopla to England and works very hard to fit in as its new designated king. He is assisted by the ever-unctuous, very serious family factotum Willingham (Peter O'Toole). The trouble is, he doesn't have instincts for politics English-style, and he is constantly "putting a foot wrong," as they might say. The most difficult situation for him is when he develops a new love interest, and she's not "acceptable" to the upper crust. In addition to being hounded by the tabloids, he finds that "the good of the state" requires that he drop his new girlfriend. Things really come to a head just before Ralph's coronation as king. Reviewers generally loathed this feel-good comedy, but audiences seem to have enjoyed it tremendously, and it has done well in video and TV airings(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Disney's The Kid</title>
    <desc lang="en">If you could talk to the child that you used to be, what advice would you give him? That question forms the basis of this comic fantasy. Forty-year-old Russ Duritz (Bruce Willis) is a wealthy and powerful "image consultant" who has made a career out of telling people how to present themselves. But while he's a success in business, he's a failure in life; he's vain, mean-spirited, and hasn't been able to hold onto a marriage (or even a pet dog). One day, Russ is startled to meet Rusty (Spencer Breslin), a stocky kid whom he soon realizes is himself at the age of eight, having passed through a wrinkle in time. Young Rusty doesn't seem much happier than the grown-up Russ, so the older man takes his younger self under his wing and tries to teach him how to avoid the mistakes he's made, while Rusty encourages Russ to be a more caring human being. Along the way, Russ and Rusty become friends, and realize how much they can learn from each other. Disney's The Kid also stars Jean Smart as one of Russ' clients, Lily Tomlin as his assistant, and Daniel Von Bargen as his father(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Former Saturday Night Live "Weekend Update" co-anchors Tina Fey and Amy Poehler co-star in this baby-fever comedy about a single, career-oriented woman who previously put parenthood on hold, and is forced to hire a surrogate mother when she discovers there is only a one-in-a-million chance that she will be able to get pregnant. Kate Holbrook (Fey) is a 37-year-old business executive who has always put her professional life before her personal life, but these days her biological clock is ticking louder than ever before. As with everything else she has accomplished in life, Kate is determined to have a child on her own terms. Unfortunately for Kate, the chance of her ever becoming pregnant is slim to none. Undaunted, a willful Kate drafts South Philly working-class girl Angie Ostrowiski (Poehler) -- a woman who may just be her polar opposite -- to be a surrogate mother. Subsequently informed by the head of the surrogacy center (Sigourney Weaver) that her surrogate is indeed pregnant, the excited mother-to-be soon purchases every child-rearing book she can find and excitedly begins the nesting process. But life hasn't quit throwing Kate curveballs just yet, because when a pregnant Angie shows up on her doorstep with no place to live, the woman who once thrived on order finds her life descending into chaos. Now, as Kate attempts to transform Angie into the ideal expectant mother, this odd couple will discover that families aren't always biological, but occasionally formed through friendship as well. Writer Michael McCullers, who authored the screenplays for Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and Undercover Brother in addition to working on Saturday Night Live, makes his feature directorial debut with a self-penned screenplay(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A single and freewheeling travel writer finds that adapting to the nine-to-five lifestyle isn't as easy as it looks when her ailing father hires her to take control of his successful bridal magazine in this marriage-minded comedy starring Heather Graham, David Sutcliffe, Sandra Oh, and Taye Diggs. Upon returning to her hometown to once again be a bridesmaid in yet another wedding, jet-lagged, gin-soaked travel writer Pippa McGee (Graham) soon learns that her tyrannical publishing magnate father has been hospitalized after suffering a serious heart attack. As Pippa rushes to his bedside and the ailing mogul asks her to take editorial control of one of his most popular magazines, her excitement soon turns sour upon learning that the magazine in question is not a political or travel magazine, but the one and only Wedding Bells monthly. Determined to succeed despite the constant reminders of just how single she truly is, Pippa is horrified to learn that the man her father has chosen as her publishing mentor is the same man that she drunkenly came on to at her close friend's recent wedding(n)</desc>

When he meets free-spirited, 43-year-old burger joint waitress Nora Baker (Susan Sarandon), his attraction to the earthy, outspoken woman is immediate and overpowering. The difference in age isn't their only obstacle happiness: Nora's into Marilyn Monroe, drinking beer, and lives in Dogtown, the city's low-rent district, while Max is cultured, sophisticated, and wealthy. Despite their differences, Max and Nora are alike in their suffering and in their deep need for connection, but their charged relationship is put to the emotional test when it becomes clear that Max is hiding his affair with Nora from his upper middle-class, Jewish social circle. White Palace co-stars Renée Taylor, Eileen Brennan, Kathy Bates, Jason Alexander, and Corey Parker(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">"Another basement, another elevator...how can the same thing happen to the same guy twice?" asks John McClane (Bruce Willis), in what is doubtless the key question of this film. A year after foiling the terrorist takeover of a high-rise office building in the first movie, McClane is waiting to pick up his wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), at Dulles International Airport just outside Washington, D.C., on Christmas Eve. Scheduled to arrive the same evening is Ramon Esperanza (Franco Nero), a South American political figure who is being brought to the United States to stand trial for his role in a drug-smuggling ring. However, a group of terrorists, led by renegade American military officer Col. Stuart (William Sadler), take control of the airport, scuttling radio transmissions and placing their own men in the control tower. Stuart and his men ensure that Esperanza's plane lands safely, and then demand that Stuart and his men be given a fully-fueled 747 and free passage wherever they choose to go. Otherwise, they will guide the many circling jets waiting for landing instructions into definite crash landings, killing the many passengers on board. Not willing to stand aside as terrorists once again threaten his wife's life, the wise-cracking McClane once again leaps into action to foil Stuart's plans and bring the passenger jets safely to the ground. William Atherton, John Amos, Dennis Franz, and John Leguizamo highlight the supporting cast(n)</desc>

The film's signature scene is, of course, Alex's water-drenched dance audition, largely performed in long shot by her dance double Marine Jahan. Essentially an old-fashioned backstage yarn, Flashdance was given a contemporary spin by its pulsating, musical score featuring the Oscar-winning Best Song, Flashdance...What a Feeling, (music by Giorgio Moroder, lyrics by Keith Forsey and Irene Cara)(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Total Recall</title>
    <desc lang="en">In Paul Verhoeven's wild sci-fi action movie Total Recall, Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a 21st-century construction worker who discovers that his entire memory of the past derives from a memory chip implanted in his brain. Schwarzenegger learns that he's actually a secret agent who had become a threat to the government, so those in power planted the chip and invented a domestic lifestyle for him. Once he has realized his true identity, he travels to Mars to piece together the rest of his identity, as well as to find the man responsible for his implanted memory. Verhoeven has created a fast, furious action film with Total Recall, filled with impressive stunts and (literally) eye-popping visuals. Though the film bears only a passing resemblance to the Philip K. Dick short story it was based on ("We Can Remember It For You Wholesale"), the movie is an entertaining, if very violent, ride(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Las Vegas.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Ross Kemp ventures behind the glitz and glamour of Las Vegas, a non-stop party town where 40 million visitors spent £15billion in 2013, discovering that the strip is far from fun for some, not helped by the recession of 2008, which plunged many people into unemployment and bankruptcy. Ross meets some of the homeless who live in the city's storm drains, hears stories of drug and gambling addiction and talks to police officers, gang members and criminals who reveal how Las Vegas is a city where extreme wealth and poverty sit side by side.(n)</desc>

An unnamed catastrophe has turned the Earth into a wasteland, and as packs of feral cannibals wander the countryside, a dwindling number of survivors struggle to stay alive. Rick (Dominic Monaghan), Adam (Shawn Ashmore), Henson (Cory Hardrict), and Shannon (Shannyn Sossamon) have been journeying together for months and are the last living members of a much larger group.

She isn't interested in discussing her past or becoming friends, but the others learn she's a powerful ally in a fight. The travelers take shelter in a house, but are soon surrounded by cannibals; they quickly realize just how strong a warrior Mary can be, while also discovering the terrible truth that led her to wander alone. The Day was directed by Douglas Aarniokoski, who has accumulated extensive credits as an assistant director and helming second-unit material on major films(n)</desc>

Ted and Michael meet porn star Zack O'Tool (Matthew G. Taylor), and Ted pays the well-endowed actor to pay a visit to Emmett and change his mind about ditching his sexuality. Their foolproof plot fails. Kip is after a promotion, but Brian refuses his request for a recommendation because he doesn't think Kip is ready.

Emmett (Peter Paige) meets Heather (Tracy Waterhouse), a would-be former lesbian, at "See the Light," and she shares his desire to have a breakthrough with the opposite sex. She asks him out. Michael's (Hal Sparks) evening at home with David (Chris Potter) is interrupted when Ted (Scott Lowell) calls with news of Brian's new money worries. A perturbed David demands that Michael refrain from getting involved in Brian's problems. Brian asks Melanie (Michelle Clunie), who has left Lindsay (Thea Gill), to represent him in the lawsuit. Melanie has a few ideas on how to handle the case. "It might just be amusing to have you indebted to me for the rest of your life," Melanie tells him. Melanie takes Ted to the movies, where they run into Emmett and Heather. Ted wants to get together with Emmett, so Emmett invites him to a "See the Light" meeting. David catches Michael lying to him about spending time with Brian. Brian later pays a visit to David and lets him know that he'll lose Michael if he tries to control him. Emmett and Heather use same-sex fantasies to get through the uncomfortable business of having hetero sex.

    <desc lang="en">The Ties That Bind. Lindsay (Thea Gill) goes out of town for a teacher's conference, and because Melanie (Michelle Clunie) is also away, she leaves Gus with Brian (Gale Harold). David's (Chris Potter) son, Hank (Ryan Cooley), is coming for a visit, and Michael (Hal Sparks) is nervous about meeting the boy. Brian's father, Jack (Lawrence Dane), pops in and tells Brian that he has cancer, and doesn't have long to live. Michael tries to make conversation with Hank, but the boy tells him he doesn't even want to be there -- his mother made him visit. Brian brings Gus over to Debbie's (Sharon Gless) and asks her to baby-sit so he can go to the Leather Ball. She has to work, so Brian makes other arrangements. When Debbie hears about Brian's dad, she tries to convince Brian to tell Jack that he's gay. Ted (Scott Lowell) recognizes an old friend from business school, Dale (Bobby Johnston), who happens to be decked out in leather, whipping a willing slave. Dale invites Ted to his place, but Ted freaks out when Dale invites him to relinquish control. Later Ted realizes how predictable he is, and reconsiders. When Melanie gets wind of Lindsay's babysitting arrangements, she comes home early, only to find Justin (Randy Harrison) about to give the baby hot milk. She lets Brian have it when he gets home. When David leaves on an emergency call, Hank tells Brian that he doesn't have a problem with his dad being gay -- he just can't relax with him, because David makes plans for every minute of every visit. The two ditch David's itinerary and spend a fun afternoon reading comics. Brian comes out to Jack, who reacts badly. But later, he goes to visit Brian again, and learns that he has a grandson(n)</desc>

Justin (Randy Harrison) brags to Brian (Gale Harold) about his SAT scores, and all the Ivy League schools he could attend. Brian seems concerned about Justin going to school out of state, and Justin teases him for revealing that he cares. At school, Justin intercedes when homophobe Chris Hobbs (Alec McClure) taunts another student and gets into a scuffle. The teacher blames Justin, who curses him out, earning a suspension. Debbie (Sharon Gless) suggests Justin try to educate the people at his school. Mel goes to see Lindsay, and is shocked when a snooty French guy, Guillaume (Noam Jenkins) answers the door, and won't let her in to see Gus. Brian is also concerned when Mel tells him about it. They don't feel any better when they find out Lindsay plans to marry Guillaume for immigration reasons. Michael finds out the checks he's been giving David for their expenses haven't been cashed, and confronts him. David agrees that they should only do things they both can afford, before revealing that he had planned a surprise weeklong trip to Paris. Michael suddenly feels conflicted. Justin and Daphne (Makyla Smith), with help from Debbie and Brian start a "Gay-Straight Student Alliance" at school, but the principal stops the meeting because they didn't go through "proper channels."

    <title lang="en">The Hurt Locker</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Kathryn Bigelow's Iraq War-set action thriller presents the conflict in the Middle East from the perspective of those who witnessed the fighting firsthand -- the soldiers. As an elite Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal team tactfully navigates the streets of present-day Iraq, they face the constant threat of death from incoming bombs and sharp-shooting snipers. In Baghdad, roadside bombs are a common danger. The Army is working to make the city a safer place for Americans and Iraqis, so when it comes to dismantling IEDs (improvised explosive devices) the Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) crew is always on their game. But protecting the public isn't easy when there's no room for error, and every second spent dismantling a bomb is another second spent flirting with death. Now, as three fearless bomb technicians take on the most dangerous job in Baghdad, it's only a matter of time before one of them gets sent to "the hurt locker." Starring Jeremy Renner, Guy Pearce, and Ralph Fiennes(n)</desc>

When Frank Vega (Danny Trejo) returned home from fighting for his country, he should have been hailed as a hero. Instead, he drifted into the margins of society after failing to find a job and being abandoned by his high-school sweetheart. Decades later, when Frank sees a pair of skinheads harassing an elderly black man on a city bus, he knocks them both out as the incident is captured on video. An instant viral hit, the widely circulated video turns Frank into an Internet celebrity. But his fame comes at a high price when his best friend Klondike is killed and authorities sweep the murder under the rug. Meanwhile, Frank's biggest battle is yet to come. Ron Perlman and Charles S.

After a botched job, they're sent by their boss Harry Waters to hide out in Bruges. Ken loves the city and its history; Ray hates it, until he hooks up with beautiful drugs dealer Chloe and a mouthy dwarf actor, Jimmy. Unfortunately, just as life seems to be improving for the two hitmen, psychopathic Harry phones to deliver stark instructions: the nature of the botched hit has offended his sense of morality and he's decided to break up the partnership, ordering one of the duo to kill the other. This tests the bond linking the three men, and leads to a violent denouement in the ancient city's cobbled streets(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In 'Brooklyn's Finest', we're taken on a dark ride through the streets of Brooklyn, following three New York Police officers as they wrestle with temptation while attempting to uphold the law and deal with the pressures of the job. Eddie (Richard Gere) is a bitter and disillusioned veteran cop who's a week away from retirement. Tango (Don Cheadle) is an undercover narcotics cop who tries desperately to leave the streets and earn a promotion to a desk job. Much like Eddie, he's lost sight of his priorities and his loyalties seem to lie more with notorious inner-city drug dealer Caz (Wesley Snipes) than with the boys in blue. At the same time, narcotics detective Sal is a family man in despair and needs to raise money to buy a better house for his family. In seven days, the lives of all three officers will converge at one crime scene(n)</desc>

Meanwhile, Bucky connects with a friend of his parents, Miles Deep (Don Johnson), who pities the backwards man-child and gives him a shot in the world of porn - only to discover that he's severely lacking in both experience and manliness. Through sheer luck, the footage of Bucky becomes a viral hit on the internet and he is propelled to the top of the adult film business, irking the current king of porn actors, Dick Shadow (Stephen Dorff), who'll do anything to not be in the shadow of the small time fool.

    <desc lang="en">You can take the clerks out of the Quick Stop, but you just can't take the Quick Stop out of the clerks as Dante (Brian O'Halloran) and Randall (Jeff Anderson) prove in this long-awaited sequel to Kevin Smith's breakthrough comedy. Years after we last saw them, Dante is still toiling behind the counter at a New Jersey convenience store and Randall is still annoying customers at the video shop next door -- or at least they are until a fire burns down the strip mall, forcing Dante and Randall to look for work. Times are tough, and the guys find themselves embracing the ultimate indignity as they take jobs at Mooby's, a fast-food outlet where the burgers are advertised as "udderly delicious." While Randall's snarky attitude toward the public remains unchanged, Dante is trying to make the best of the situation as he plans to marry his fiancée, Emma (Jennifer Schwalbach Smith), and move to Florida. However, Dante's plans are complicated when he falls for Becky (Rosario Dawson), a funny and tart-tongued woman who happens to be his boss at Mooby's. Lurking about in the background, as always, are Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith), who for good or ill have changed even less with the passage of time than Dante and Randall. Clerks II also features Wanda Sykes, Ethan Suplee, and Trevor Fehrman, with cameo appearances from Kevin Smith regulars Ben Affleck and Jason Lee(n)</desc>

It's the mid-1970s and southern Californian teen Joan Larkin has changed her name to Joan Jett. Along with her new dark, edgy identity comes a nascent desire: to create an all-girl rock band. Joan and her aggressive manager Kim Fowley stumble across the perfect face for the band: 15-year-old blonde bombshell Cherie Currie. The two girls become close, with Cherie's sweet melodies slickly harmonising with Joan's electrifying guitar solos to great effect. They name themselves The Runaways and, after recruiting a lead guitarist and a bass player, are soon signed to Mercury Records, and plunged into the deep end of 70s rock excess. The success of their first album is massive. But, after a concert in Japan, the rest of the band discover magazines that feature only pictures of Cherie inside them - and are furious that they've been left out. Cherie begins to crumble under the pressures of being the face of the band, and finds solace in alcohol and drugs. As the band's stability disintegrates, can the girls rediscover the runaway rock and roll lifestyle they sought? Also starring Stella Maeve, Scout Taylor-Compton and Alia Shawkat(n)</desc>

However, Olivia feels as if she could use some support, both personal and financial, from her best friends, all of whom at very least have more in the bank than she does. But that's not to say they don't have problems of their own. Christine (Catherine Keener) and her husband Patrick (Jason Isaacs) are screenwriters who have discovered that collaborating is more stress than they can deal with. Jane (Frances McDormand) is married to Aaron (Simon McBurney); they work together as designers, but while their professional relationship is cordial, they've become numb to one another as lovers and friends. And Franny (Joan Cusack) and Matt (Greg Germann) are a couple who comfortably support themselves and their children thanks to an inherited fortune; while their material needs are met, emotionally they can barely handle marriage and parenthood. Friends With Money was written and directed by Nicole Holofcener, who previously made the acclaimed independent features Walking and Talking and Lovely &amp; Amazing(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Runaways</title>
    <desc lang="en">Kristin Stewart and Dakota Fanning star in Floria Sigismondi's rock biopic, based on Cherie Currie's autobiography. It's the mid-1970s and southern Californian teen Joan Larkin has changed her name to Joan Jett. Along with her new dark, edgy identity comes a nascent desire: to create an all-girl rock band. Joan and her aggressive manager Kim Fowley stumble across the perfect face for the band: 15-year-old blonde bombshell Cherie Currie. The two girls become close, with Cherie's sweet melodies slickly harmonising with Joan's electrifying guitar solos to great effect. They name themselves The Runaways and, after recruiting a lead guitarist and a bass player, are soon signed to Mercury Records, and plunged into the deep end of 70s rock excess. The success of their first album is massive. But, after a concert in Japan, the rest of the band discover magazines that feature only pictures of Cherie inside them - and are furious that they've been left out. Cherie begins to crumble under the pressures of being the face of the band, and finds solace in alcohol and drugs. As the band's stability disintegrates, can the girls rediscover the runaway rock and roll lifestyle they sought? Also starring Stella Maeve, Scout Taylor-Compton and Alia Shawkat(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</title>
    <desc lang="en">Terry Gilliam (Brazil, Twelve Monkeys, The Fisher King) directed this colorful, stylized, pseudo-psychedelic $21-million adaptation of the 1971 Hunter S. Thompson classic, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey into the Heart of the American Dream, about stoned sportswriter Raoul Duke, Thompson's alter ego, on a wild drug-crazed road trip, a paranoid plummet into the belly of the beast, with his pal, lawyer Oscar Zeta Acosta. Originally serialized in Rolling Stone (November 1971), the book catapulted Thompson headfirst toward the Kerouac-Mailer-Capote pantheon and jump-started the entire movement of "gonzo journalism." Carrying a suitcase of drugs, Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp with shaved pate) and his attorney Dr. Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro) drive a red convertible across the Mojave from L.A. to Vegas, where Duke has an assignment to cover the Mint 400 desert motorcycle race. As the drugs kick in, Duke ventures into voiceover, filling in the blank spots and narrative gaps. "This is not a good town for psychedelic drugs," says Duke, but even so, they consume vast quantities, eventually escalating to ether. Duke notes that with ether "you can actually watch yourself behaving this terrible way, but you can't control it." The two trash their hotel room, and Gonzo goes back to L.A. Thinking the hotel room holocaust will lead to an arrest, Duke begins a drive back to L.A., but after an odd encounter with a highway patrolman (Gary Busey) and a telephone conversation with Gonzo, he returns to Vegas to cover the District Attorney Convention on Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs in the glitzy Flamingo Hotel. This time the drugged-out duo trash their Flamingo room. The crazed carnival atmosphere segues into a carney casino, Bazooko's Circus, where a barker (Penn Jillette) spiels amid aerialists, clowns, and a rotating carousel bar. Gonzo worries over runaway teen Lucy (Christina Ricci), who paints portraits of Barbra Streisand. Soon the hallucinations begin: Duke sees Gonzo transmogrify into a demon with breasts on its back, and an acid vision of a Vegas bar features large legit lounge lizards (courtesy of monster makeup man Rob Bottin). Flashbacks depicting Duke's intro to the drug scene jump back to love-Haight relationships in San Francisco's Summer of Love. Cameos and guest stars include Mark Harmon, Cameron Diaz, Flea, Lyle Lovett, Harry Dean Stanton, Ellen Barkin, Tobey Maguire, and Hunter S. Thompson himself. The film features a Geffen Records soundtrack mixing rock of the period with Vegas lounge tunes. Over the years, various script adaptations came and went as did numerous talents; people connected with past efforts to film Thompson's book include Martin Scorsese, Jack Nicholson, Dan Aykroyd, John Belushi, and writer-director Alex Cox. Shown in competition at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Waking Life</title>
    <desc lang="en">From director Richard Linklater, who created the independent breakout films Slacker and Dazed and Confused, comes a digital video effort that has animated in a process called interpolated rotoscoping, brought to life by 31 animation artists who drew over live-action footage to create a dream-like state that is both real and surreal. The director works in a free-associative manner much like in Slacker and opens on a young vagabond arriving at a town by train. After a ride in an odd car-boat, he meets up with a professor who voices his deep philosophical leanings. The young man stumbles upon more figures that resemble the media, evolution, and even characters out of other Linklater features, including Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, whose characters in Before Sunrise make an appearance, as well as director Steven Soderbergh, who relates an anecdote about Louis Malle telling Billy Wilder that his new film "is like a dream." A non-narrative piece that flows like a fever dream, Waking Life features voicework by over 70 actors, including Wiley Wiggins, Adam Goldberg, and Nicky Katt(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Wet Hot American Summer</title>
    <desc lang="en">1980s teen comedies finally get the parody they so richly deserve with Wet Hot American Summer, the first feature film from writer/director David Wain and co-screenwriter Michael Showalter, formerly of the sketch comedy troupe the State. It's the last day of the summer season at Camp Firewood, and as camp director Beth (Janeane Garofalo) prepares to wrap things up, the staff of teenage counselors realize this is their last chance to do something about the summer romances that have been brewing for the past three months. Sweet but shy Coop (Michael Showalter) is crazy about pretty Katie (Marguerite Moreau), but there's the problem of her severely moody boyfriend Andy (Paul Rudd). Meanwhile, Victor (Ken Marino) is trying to score with sexy Abby (Marisa Ryan), who is known to make friends easily, and McKinley (Michael Ian Black) and Ben (Bradley Cooper) attempt to keep their hot and heavy relationship a secret. Meanwhile, arts and crafts teacher Gail (Molly Shannon) turns to her students for comfort as her marriage falls apart, drama coach Susie (Amy Poehler) tries to whip the talent show into shape with Ben's help, and camp chef Gene (Christopher Meloni) deals with his unique sexual quirks with the help of a talking can of vegetables (voiced by H. Jon Benjamin). Beth even finds time for romance with socially inept astrophysicist Henry (David Hyde Pierce), but first Henry has to save Camp Firewood from a large piece of space junk about to re-enter Earth's atmosphere. Like Wain and Showalter, Ken Marino, Michael Ian Black, and Joe Lo Truglio (who appears in a small role) were also members of the State; fellow State alumnus Kerri Kenney was cast in a supporting role in the film, but her character didn't appear in the final cut(n)</desc>

Buddy is the control-freak Hollywood production executive with a reputation for abusing his employees. He is particularly abusive to his young personal assistant Guy, a recent film-school graduate and naive Hollywood newcomer. The idealistic young Guy is routinely humiliated by Buddy. Unable to stand anymore abuse and no longer the naive idealist, Guy turns on Buddy. He ends up tying him up and then subjecting Buddy to all the sadism, and torture Buddy inflicted on others. He threatens to do even worse, but is deterred by an unexpected arrival, whose presence leads to a surprising final plot twist. The film was first shown at Telluride Film Festival as The Buddy Factor but was retitled for its general release in 1995(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Nervous Man in a $4 Room</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Nervous Man in a $4 Room. Though obviously an episode designed to absorb the costs of the more expensive Twilight Zone installments, this was one of the better efforts of the series' second season, with a tour de force performance by Joe Mantell as penny-ante gangster Jackie Rhoades. Ordered to bump off a rival gangster, the timorous Rhoades tries to summon up the courage for the foul deed, only to be thwarted at every turn by his own conscience -- who as it turns out has more "guts" than Jackie ever dreamed of. Though essentially a solo endeavor, the episode also features a good performance from future producer-director William D. Gordon as Jackie's nasty boss, while another future director, Brian G. Hutton, serves as Joe Mantell's back-to-camera stand-in when the actor "confronts" himself. Written by Rod Serling and scored by Jerry Goldsmith, "Nervous Man in a Four Dollar Room" was the first episode produced for Twilight Zone's second season, even though it was telecast as the third episode, on October 14, 1960(n)</desc>

What makes Button such a curious case is that when he is born in New Orleans just after World War I, he is already in his eighties, and proceeds to live his life aging in reverse. This sweeping film follows the character's unusual life into the 21st century as he experiences joy and sadness, loves lost and found, and the meaning of timelessness.

    <title lang="en">Back to the Future Part III</title>
    <desc lang="en">The final episode in the fast-paced Back to the Future trilogy has time traveler Marty McFly heading back to the Old West to save his pal Doc, the inventor of the magical DeLorean time-traveling machine that took Marty back to the 1950s in the first film and shot him into the 21st century for the second episode. Marty's latest journey began at the end of Part II when he received a letter dated 1885 from Doc, who was accidentally stranded in 1885 by a stray bolt of lightning. The letter says that he cannot come home until he repairs the DeLorean, which he buried in the desert to keep it safe. Marty goes to dig it up so he can fix it and rescue Doc. Unfortunately, he is en route to the sight when he finds a tombstone with his friend's name on it; beneath it are the mysterious words "With Love from Clara." The date reads 1885. Marty realizes that if he cannot prevent Doc's early demise that Doc will never have existed and that will cause all kinds of problems. Unfortunately, no sooner does McFly make it back to the past, where he adopts the name "Clint Eastwood" when he gets into trouble, leaving his forbears to save him. Meanwhile, Doc, who is still alive, falls in love with the beauteous schoolmarm Clara Clayton, the girl he knows he must marry. They meet when he saves her from a runaway wagon. When not wrestling with their own problems, Marty and Doc must figure out how to fix the disabled DeLorean so they can return to the present. Needing the car to go 88 mph before it can breach time, the two devise a crazy scheme involving a stolen train, an uncompleted stretch of track and a yawning gorge that comprises the story's thrilling highlight(n)</desc>
