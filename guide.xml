Ultimately, the mother and daughter are able to relocate to an apartment, which, despite its excessively dilapidated interior, seems to be an adequate location for beginning a new life. Before long, however, what appears to be the spirit of a young girl begins to haunt them. No stranger to mental illness, the wary young woman brushes the visions aside as part of the inherent stress of making the transition from housewife to working, single mom. As time goes by and the apparent haunting does not subside, the apartment's new residents are forced to examine the history of its former tenants. Dark Water also features performances from John C. Reilly, Tim Roth, and Dougray Scott(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Mark Wahlberg stars in this affectionate remake of the British classic as Charlie Croker, who, after taking over from John Bridger as the leader of a gang of thieves, celebrates his new status with a multi-million-dollar job in Venice. But gang member Steve Frezelli double-crosses his friends, kills Bridger and leaves the rest for dead. The gang survive and Croker spends a year tracking the traitor, using the safecracking skills of Bridger's daughter Stella to rob Steve and avenge her father's death.

    <title lang="en">Shaun of the Dead</title>
    <desc lang="en">It's often said that the true character of a man is only revealed in times of dire crisis, and for likable, lovelorn loser Shaun (Simon Pegg), that moment of reckoning came when the dead rose from their slumber to feast on the flesh of the living. A hapless electronics store employee who spends most of his spare time downing pints at the local pub with his roommate, Ed (Nick Frost), Shaun's life seems to fall apart when he is dumped by his girlfriend, Liz (Kate Ashfield), and his obnoxious stepfather, Philip (Bill Nighy), shows up to berate him for not being more attentive to his caring mother Barbara (Penelope Wilton) -- especially since he forgot to send flowers for her birthday. Things take a turn for the worse when the dead return to stake their claim on the Earth, and though the chaos that follows threatens to swallow up all of England, it's up to Shaun to keep his cool and prove himself once and for all by successfully rescuing Liz and his mother. With his trusty roommate by his side, nothing -- not even the living dead -- can stand between Shaun and the two most important women in his life(n)</desc>

One photograph stood for them all. Anyone who saw it never forgot it. It is one of the most unforgettable images from 9/11: a photograph of a falling man, frozen in mid-air, perfectly parallel with the lines of the World Trade Center. The image ran in newspapers and magazines across the world over the following week, and should have remained one of the defining images of that terrible day. Instead, it was quickly airbrushed out of history. 9/11: The Falling Man follows the trail of that photograph: of the photographer who nearly lost his life shooting it; of the citizens who decried it; of the editors who published it and then reluctantly banned it; of the journalists who tried to uncover the falling man's identity; of the wife and daughters of the identified man and many others. The film asks if this single, harrowing image can help to define our memory of the awful suffering of that day, and help history to give a proper due to the jumpers of 9/11?(n)</desc>

For two months every year, the people of Churchill must share their town with huge packs of polar bears, which gather at the bay every autumn to wait for the sea ice to form, so they can begin their winter hunt. Gordon goes on patrol with the `bear cops' charged with ensuring the towns residents - and the bears themselves - stay safe, and meets the bin-men who must dodge bears every day as they deliver refuse to the dump. He also illustrates the dangers of living in the `polar bear capital of the world' as he interviews a young woman who was mauled by a bear, right in the middle of Churchill's main street.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In the early 1960s drum shop owner Jim Marshall launched the loudest amplifier in the world at a point in time widely perceived to be the birth of rock. Young musicians like Clapton and Hendrix rushed to adopt the revolutionary `Marshall sound', and the electric guitar spoke for a new generation, while stacks and walls became an essential backdrop at concerts. The company was rescued from financial meltdown by comic exposure in the 1984 movie This is Spinal Tap, and the electronic boxes were propelled to iconic status. This documentary charts the amp's history, with contributions from rock musicians Pete Townshend, Lemmy and Slash, plus an interview with the founder himself.(n)</desc>

Rumours of relationships with distant cousin Francis Dereham and Thomas Culpeper led to Catherine Howard's execution, while Lady Arabella, a serious threat to the ruling Stuart dynasty, is thought to have committed suicide against a backdrop of a cross-dressing noblewoman and two escapes from the Tower.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Immigration Tango</title>
    <desc lang="en">Love crosses international boundaries and makes a big mess en route in this romantic comedy. Carlos Sanchez (Carlos Leon) is from Latin America, and Elena Dubrovnik (Elika Portnoy) is from Russia. Carlos and Elena are in love and living in the United States, but while they'd like to stay, they have a problem -- their visas are soon to expire, and they aren't sure when or if they'll be able to get green cards that will allow them permanent residence. Carlos and Elena are close friends with Mike White (McCaleb Burnett) and Betty Bristol (Ashley Wolfe), who were born and raised in the States. Like Carlos and Elena, Mike and Betty are planning to marry but haven't done so yet, and when they learn of their friends' dilemma, someone comes up with a solution -- Carlos will marry Betty, Mike will marry Elena, and once their respective green cards come through, both couples will divorce and everyone lives happily ever after. However, the plan doesn't go as smoothly as expected -- suspicious immigration agents are keeping a close watch on Carlos and Elena, so the newlyweds have to live with their respective spouses and act happily married in order to maintain the illusion of matrimony, which leads the four friends into a variety of romantic complications. Immigration Tango received its world premiere at the 2010 Boston International Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Based on the 1997 National Book Award-nominated novel of the same name by Diane Johnson (co-writer of the script for Stanley Kubrick's The Shining), Le Divorce is a romantic comedy from director James Ivory. Revisiting the "Americans in France" theme that Ivory explored in 1998's A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries, the film stars Kate Hudson as Isabel Walker. When she receives word that her pregnant poetess sister Roxy (Naomi Watts) has been left by her philandering French husband, artist Charles-Henri de Persand (Melvil Poupaud), Isabel offers her help and moral support. As the depressive Roxy struggles with the separation proceedings -- which include the rights to ownership of a work of art that's a family heirloom -- Isabel takes a job with author Olivia Pace and has a fling with the bohemian Yves (Romain Duris). But things get complicated when the younger, more impudent sister decides instead to pursue Charles' uncle, the snooty, married diplomat Edgar (Thierry Lhermitte), and when a mysterious man (Matthew Modine) starts stalking Roxy. Eventually, the rest of the plucky Walker clan has to come to the aid of the siblings. Stockard Channing and Sam Waterston co-star(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Director Marc Forster, winner of Best Feature at Slamdance for his debut film Loungers (1996) and the "Someone to Watch" Independent Spirit Award for his indie drama Everything Put Together (2000), follows up those acclaimed projects with this intense, racially charged romance. Billy Bob Thornton stars as Georgia prison guard Hank Grotowski, a hard-drinking racist ex-cop whose father, Buck (Peter Boyle), is dying of emphysema and whose son, Sonny (Heath Ledger), works the execution detail at the prison's death row. When Sonny commits suicide, Hank is devastated and quits his job, spiraling into a deep depression until, one night, he comes to the aid of Leticia (Halle Berry), a beautiful African-American woman whose son, Tyrell (Coronji Calhoun), has been hit by a car. When Tyrell dies, Leticia and Hank find themselves to be unexpected soul mates linked together by tragic grief. It's not long before Hank discovers that Leticia is the widow of Lawrence Musgrove (Sean Combs), the man whose execution by electric chair he and his late son helped to orchestrate. Monster's Ball (2001) is based on a screenplay by actors Milo Addica and Will Rokos, who spent five years developing their script into a feature.

    <desc lang="en">Love crosses international boundaries and makes a big mess en route in this romantic comedy. Carlos Sanchez (Carlos Leon) is from Latin America, and Elena Dubrovnik (Elika Portnoy) is from Russia. Carlos and Elena are in love and living in the United States, but while they'd like to stay, they have a problem -- their visas are soon to expire, and they aren't sure when or if they'll be able to get green cards that will allow them permanent residence. Carlos and Elena are close friends with Mike White (McCaleb Burnett) and Betty Bristol (Ashley Wolfe), who were born and raised in the States. Like Carlos and Elena, Mike and Betty are planning to marry but haven't done so yet, and when they learn of their friends' dilemma, someone comes up with a solution -- Carlos will marry Betty, Mike will marry Elena, and once their respective green cards come through, both couples will divorce and everyone lives happily ever after. However, the plan doesn't go as smoothly as expected -- suspicious immigration agents are keeping a close watch on Carlos and Elena, so the newlyweds have to live with their respective spouses and act happily married in order to maintain the illusion of matrimony, which leads the four friends into a variety of romantic complications. Immigration Tango received its world premiere at the 2010 Boston International Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Based on the 1997 National Book Award-nominated novel of the same name by Diane Johnson (co-writer of the script for Stanley Kubrick's The Shining), Le Divorce is a romantic comedy from director James Ivory. Revisiting the "Americans in France" theme that Ivory explored in 1998's A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries, the film stars Kate Hudson as Isabel Walker. When she receives word that her pregnant poetess sister Roxy (Naomi Watts) has been left by her philandering French husband, artist Charles-Henri de Persand (Melvil Poupaud), Isabel offers her help and moral support. As the depressive Roxy struggles with the separation proceedings -- which include the rights to ownership of a work of art that's a family heirloom -- Isabel takes a job with author Olivia Pace and has a fling with the bohemian Yves (Romain Duris). But things get complicated when the younger, more impudent sister decides instead to pursue Charles' uncle, the snooty, married diplomat Edgar (Thierry Lhermitte), and when a mysterious man (Matthew Modine) starts stalking Roxy. Eventually, the rest of the plucky Walker clan has to come to the aid of the siblings. Stockard Channing and Sam Waterston co-star(n)</desc>

Because they work at the same place, Fry thinks Amy is smothering him and he wants to break up. Just as he is about to tell her that it's over, they get into a serious car accident and his head is transferred onto Amy's body. Meanwhile, Bender has started up a computer dating service and both Leela and Fry sign up for it. Amy goes out with Gary for Valentine's Day while Leela and Fry meet their match-ups from Bender's dating service. The dates turn out to be a disaster because Bender just took everyone's money and picked up random people at the bus station. Dr. Zoidberg eventually puts Fry's head back on his own body(n)</desc>

An investigation uncovers that Chinpokomon is being used to brainwash kids into Anti-American actions. This typically irreverent episode of South Park references Independence Day and gets big laughs from a very old (and politically incorrect) gag concerning the physical size of various nationalities. "Chinpokomon" first aired November 3, 1999, on Comedy Central(n)</desc>

After the party, he reveals his latest creation: his 12-year-old clone, Cubert Farnsworth (Kath Soucie). The crew can't take the clone's obnoxious behavior and the Professor is distraught to learn that Cubert doesn't even want to be a scientist. Wanting to end his life, the Professor heads out to the Near Death Star, a place where people over the age of 160 go to die -- it turns out he had been lying about his age in order to avoid going there. The crew finds out where he is and heads out to rescue him. "A Clone of My Own" is the first Futurama episode to acknowledge the progression of time, as this episode takes place in the year 3001(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">E:60</title>
    <desc lang="en">Originally titled ESPN Reports, this was the cable service's effort to create a 60 Minutes-style weekly newsmagazine focusing on sports. The first episode set the tone with a piece on the "football fever" at Miami Northwestern High School, an interview with former major leaguer Cecil Fielder, a human-interest story concerning the tragically premature death of UNC Tar Heels "mascot" Jason Ray, and some musings from self-proclaimed sports psychic Dr. Bob. The individual segments were handled by such correspondents as Jeremy Schaap, Michael Smith, Rachel Nichols, Lisa Salters and Tom Ferry, while Bill Simmons, aka "The Sports Guy", appeared at the end of each episode with a few Andy Rooney-like random comments. Almost universally derided by the "legitimate" cable-news establishment, the series was generally praised by viewers as a noble effort to bring a straight-news slant to ESPN's familiar sports reportage. E:60 first aired on October 16, 2007(n)</desc>

The programme follows a bloodhound and a bearded collie living in a rescue centre, as professional trainers teach them to do the jobs they were bred for, hoping that sniffing out criminals and herding sheep will give them the chance of a more settled life.

Frank Connor (Garcia) is a San Francisco police officer who lives to uphold the law, but is forced to take desperate measures in order to find a comparable bone marrow donor for his son. Peter McCabe (Keaton) is the boy's perfect DNA match. He's also a homicidal, yet charismatic sociopath serving a life sentence in a maximum-security prison. When McCabe escapes on his way to the hospital for the transplant, he leaves a trail of dead and wounded in his wake, and the hospital becomes a bloody battleground. In the ensuing cat-and-mouse game, Connor finds that he and McCabe are more alike than he imagined, since McCabe's survival represents his son's only hope(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Chinatown</title>
    <desc lang="en">"You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't," warns water baron Noah Cross (John Huston), when smooth cop-turned-private eye J.J. "Jake" Gittes (Jack Nicholson) starts nosing around Cross's water diversion scheme. That proves to be the ominous lesson of Chinatown, Roman Polanski's critically lauded 1974 revision of 1940s film noir detective movies. In 1930s Los Angeles, "matrimonial work" specialist Gittes is hired by Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) to tail her husband, Water Department engineer Hollis Mulwray (Darrell Zwerling). Gittes photographs him in the company of a young blonde and figures the case is closed, only to discover that the real Mrs. Mulwray had nothing to do with hiring Gittes in the first place. When Hollis turns up dead, Gittes decides to investigate further, encountering a shady old-age home, corrupt bureaucrats, angry orange farmers, and a nostril-slicing thug (Polanski) along the way. By the time he confronts Cross, Evelyn's father and Mulwray's former business partner, Jake thinks he knows everything, but an even more sordid truth awaits him. When circumstances force Jake to return to his old beat in Chinatown, he realizes just how impotent he is against the wealthy, depraved Cross. "Forget it, Jake," his old partner tells him. "It's Chinatown." Reworking the somber underpinnings of detective noir along more pessimistic lines, Polanski and screenwriter Robert Towne convey a '70s-inflected critique of capitalist and bureaucratic malevolence in a carefully detailed period piece harkening back to the genre's roots in the 1930s and '40s. Gittes always has a smart comeback like Humphrey Bogart's Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe, but the corruption Gittes finds is too deep for one man to stop. Other noir revisions, such as Robert Altman's The Long Goodbye (1973) and Arthur Penn's Night Moves (1975), also centered on the detective's inefficacy in an uncertain '70s world, but Chinatown's period sheen renders this dilemma at once contemporary and timeless, pointing to larger implications about the effects of corporate rapaciousness on individuals. Polanski and Towne clashed over Chinatown's ending; Polanski won the fight, but Towne won the Oscar for Best Screenplay. Chinatown was nominated for ten other Oscars, including Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, Cinematography, Art Direction, Costumes, and Score(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Girly Edition. When the quality of his children's television show hits a new low, Krusty the Clown (voice of Dan Castellaneta) is forced by the FCC to add some educational content to the program, and he teams up with the Springfield Schools and Channel 6 News to create a news segment featuring stories by kids and for kids. Lisa Simpson (voice of Yeardley Smith) becomes the news segment's anchorperson, but when her brother Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright) gets jealous, mother Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) persuades Lisa to let Bart be the show's sports reporter. Bart's lively style attracts the attention of the Channel 6 staff and he's promoted to co-anchor, much to Lisa's chagrin. Bart's gift for sappy, sentimental human interest stories earns him a large following, but Lisa's attempts to follow his lead are little short of disastrous, and she tries to ruin his reputation by persuading him to do a story she knows will backfire on him. Meanwhile, Homer (also voiced by Dan Castellaneta) persuades a social service agency called Animal Assistants to give him a helper monkey, though under Homer's tutelage, Mojo the Monkey is transformed from a clever lower primate to a fat, bloated wreck.

    <desc lang="en">Homer to the Max. Television devotee Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) is settling in for an exciting evening of new mid-season replacement shows when he watches the premiere of an action drama called Police Cops and is pleased to discover the suave and fearless lead detective is named Homer Simpson. The coincidence gives Homer a boost in self-esteem until he sees the second episode, in which the Homer Simpson character has been reworked into a half-bright bumbling oaf. Homer appeals to the producers of Police Cops , who refuse to reconsider the character's new direction, so Homer changes his name to Max Power. Homer adopts a new personality to go along with the new name, and energetic and ambitious Max Power makes friends with Trent Steel (voice of Hank Azaria), a member of Springfield's moneyed elite. Homer and his wife Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) enjoy traveling in new, posh circles and meeting the town's most important people, but when his new pals want him to take part in a protest to protect a forest scheduled to be clear cut, Homer isn't so sure he feels like being arrested for his new friends' principles. Featuring a voice cameo from actor and environmental activist Ed Begley Jr. (who recites the classic line "It's a go-cart powered by my own sense of self-satisfaction"), "Homer To The Max" first aired on February 7, 1999(n)</desc>

Ben "Finn" Finnegan (McConaughey) is a treasure hunter who has made it his mission in life to track down the Queen's Dowry -- a legendary collection of 40 chests filled with priceless treasure, and lost at sea in 1715. But in his single-minded quest to track down this sizable booty, Finn has sadly neglected his marriage to his loving wife Tess (Hudson). Tess has grown tired of the hunt, and now she's looking to start her life anew by going to work on the massive yacht of globetrotting billionaire Nigel Honeycutt (Donald Sutherland). But just as Tess begins to relish the freedom on her new, laid-back lifestyle, Finn uses his roughish charm to convince the adventurous baron and his debutante daughter Gemma (Alexis Dziena) that the elusive Spanish treasure is finally within reach. Of course no magnate in his right mind would reject the prospect of tracking down the most mythical treasure on the planet, and now as the hapless Tess is forced on yet another wild goose chase, her husband's former mentor Moe Fitch (Ray Winstone) and a greedy local gangster (Kevin Hart) up the stakes by joining in on the race(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">My Big Fat Greek Wedding</title>
    <desc lang="en">One woman's rocky road to the altar gets played for laughs in this comedy, adapted from the one-woman off-Broadway show written by and starring Nia Vardalos. Toula (Vardalos) is a Greek-American woman who is in her early thirties and single, with no immediate prospects of changing that status any time soon. This bothers Toula a bit, but not half as much as it distresses her mother (Lainie Kazan) and father (Michael Constantine), who want to send her to Greece in hopes of finding a husband in the old country. Toula isn't interested in leaving the country to find a man, but since she works in the family business -- a Greek restaurant in Chicago called Dancing Zorba's -- she has to hear about it whether she likes it or not. One day, after seeing a handsome stranger in the restaurant and not having the courage to talk to him, Toula decides she needs a bit of self-improvement. Despite her dad's misgivings, Toula signs up for a night-school class studying computers, trades in her glasses for contact lenses, gets a different job at a travel agency, and spruces herself up with a new look and a new attitude. To her very pleasant surprise, she once again encounters the handsome stranger, who soon asks her out on a date. Schoolteacher Ian Miller (John Corbett) is seemingly perfect -- he's tall, handsome, smart, good-natured, and soon in love with Toula -- except for two little things: he's not Greek, and he's a vegetarian, both of which horrify Toula's family. When Ian pops the question (and Toula says yes), the bride-to-be has to negotiate a reasonably peaceful meeting between Ian's upper-class parents and her own working-class extended family. There's also the matter of the wedding, which Toula's mother is planning around the notion that quantity IS quality. My Big Fat Greek Wedding also features Ian Gomez (Vardalos' real-life husband), Louis Mandylor, Andrea Martin, and Joey Fatone (from the pop group *NSYNC). Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson helped produce the film through the auspices of their production company, Playtone(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Viggo Mortensen, Naomi Watts, Armin Mueller-Stahl, and Vincent Cassel star in this David Cronenberg's thriller concerning a London midwife who unwittingly stumbles into a clandestine Russian sex trafficking ring. An unidentified Russian teen has been rushed to a London hospital after going into labor. Though midwife Anna Khitrova (Watts) does manage to deliver a healthy baby girl, the newborn's mother dies tragically during delivery. But the deceased mother's secrets did not die with her, because she has left behind a diary. Determined to ensure the newborn is placed with her rightful family, Anna attempts to read the diary and discovers a business card for a local restaurant therein. Upon visiting the restaurant Anna is greeted by kindly owner Semyon (Mueller-Stahl), who generously offers to translate it for her. But Semyon is not what he appears to be, and before long Anna begins to fear that the child could be in great danger. Semyon admits to Anna that the diary contains information about his son Kirill (Cassell) that could land the volatile offspring in jail despite the fact that Kirill is at heart a good person. As the truth begins to unfold and Anna begins to believe that Kirill and his driver Nikolai (Mortensen) - an ambitious driver seeking to ascent the ranks of the notorious Russian mafia - mean the baby harm, an underworld storm begins to brew that could consume all involved(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">My Big Fat Greek Wedding</title>
    <desc lang="en">One woman's rocky road to the altar gets played for laughs in this comedy, adapted from the one-woman off-Broadway show written by and starring Nia Vardalos. Toula (Vardalos) is a Greek-American woman who is in her early thirties and single, with no immediate prospects of changing that status any time soon. This bothers Toula a bit, but not half as much as it distresses her mother (Lainie Kazan) and father (Michael Constantine), who want to send her to Greece in hopes of finding a husband in the old country. Toula isn't interested in leaving the country to find a man, but since she works in the family business -- a Greek restaurant in Chicago called Dancing Zorba's -- she has to hear about it whether she likes it or not. One day, after seeing a handsome stranger in the restaurant and not having the courage to talk to him, Toula decides she needs a bit of self-improvement. Despite her dad's misgivings, Toula signs up for a night-school class studying computers, trades in her glasses for contact lenses, gets a different job at a travel agency, and spruces herself up with a new look and a new attitude. To her very pleasant surprise, she once again encounters the handsome stranger, who soon asks her out on a date. Schoolteacher Ian Miller (John Corbett) is seemingly perfect -- he's tall, handsome, smart, good-natured, and soon in love with Toula -- except for two little things: he's not Greek, and he's a vegetarian, both of which horrify Toula's family. When Ian pops the question (and Toula says yes), the bride-to-be has to negotiate a reasonably peaceful meeting between Ian's upper-class parents and her own working-class extended family. There's also the matter of the wedding, which Toula's mother is planning around the notion that quantity IS quality. My Big Fat Greek Wedding also features Ian Gomez (Vardalos' real-life husband), Louis Mandylor, Andrea Martin, and Joey Fatone (from the pop group *NSYNC). Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson helped produce the film through the auspices of their production company, Playtone(n)</desc>

The premise is all in the title -- when the mother (Concetta Tomei) of a sniveling group of surly kids goes on a much-deserved summer vacation, she leaves her kids under the charge of an elderly distaff granny (Eda Reiss Merin). When granny ups and dies, the kids load her dead body in a trunk and deposit the package on the steps of the local funeral home. The kids are ecstatic thinking that with the big wad of cash Mom has left, they can have a summer of consumer madness. But when they find out that the money has been buried with the baby-sitter, the kids have to fend for themselves to make ends meet. Dream teen Sue Ellen (Christina Applegate) tries working at a fast food restaurant but she can't stand the grease. So, she puts together a false resume and, posing as a twenty-eight-year old, she applies for a job as a receptionist at a garment manufacturing company. The company vice president, Rose (Joanna Cassidy), is so impressed by her resume that she hires her on the spot as her executive assistant. Her deception looks to be working out great -- Sue Ellen manages to hold off the office lady killer Gus (John Getz), avoids exposure by the embittered receptionist, borrows money from the company's petty cash box for household incidentals, and continues her relationship with restaurant employee Bryan (Josh Charles). But suddenly, the clothing firm is set to go under, and Sue Ellen must use her teen fashion sense to save the company and her job . . . and she has to get the rest of the brood involved(n)</desc>

Ella (Hathaway) lives in a magical world in which each child, at the moment of their birth, is given a virtuous "gift" from a fairy godmother. Ella's so-called gift, however, is obedience. This birthright proves itself to be quite the curse once Ella finds herself in the hands of several unscrupulous characters whom she quite literally cannot disobey. Determined to gain control of her life and decisions, Ella sets off on a journey she hopes will end with the lifting of the curse in question. The path, however, isn't easy -- Ella must outwit a slew of unpleasant magical creatures ranging from ogres to talking books with evil plots. Though perilous, Ella's adventures turn out to be necessary obstacles in the path toward finding herself, and maybe even true love along the way. Ella Enchanted also features Cary Elwes, who has starred in a fantasy feature himself (the widely acclaimed The Princess Bride), Hugh Dancy, and Patrick Bergin, among others(n)</desc>

However, after years of treading water on Chicago's dinner theater circuit and playing bottom-of-the-barrel nightclubs, the two are facing middle age with minimal career success. One evening after a performance, Connie and Carla have the misfortune of witnessing the murder of nightclub owner Frank (Michael Roberds) by low-level Mafiosi; the gals are seen by the shooters, and they hit the road in fear for their lives. Connie and Carla end up in Los Angeles, where they struggle to create new identities for themselves. After witnessing a drag review at a nightclub, they realize that even they have more talent than most of the men performing that evening, and they decide to pose as female impersonators in hopes of landing a gig. Connie and Carla's new act is an immediate hit, and soon they're the toast of L.A.'s gay community. But the women discover it's difficult to keep on fooling people into believing they're men, and things become even more complicated when the Mobsters discover that Connie and Carla are in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, Connie finds herself falling for Jeff (David Duchovny), a regular guy looking for his cross-dressing brother who can't understand why he's developing a crush on a drag queen(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">A Perfect Murder</title>
    <desc lang="en">A Perfect Murder is based on Frederick Knott's play +Dial M for Murder, filmed by Alfred Hitchcock in 1954. Married to commodities trader Stephen Taylor (Michael Douglas), Emily Bradford (Gwyneth Paltrow) is romantically involved with artist David Shaw (Viggo Mortensen). Aware of this affair, Stephen researches David's past, visits his loft studio, and informs David that he knows about his aliases, jail sentences, and various cons and scams directed at rich women. Then Stephen offers David $500,000 to murder Emily, and David agrees. The plan is calculated to make the murder look like an accident, but events soon go on an unscheduled course. Enter Detective Mohamed Karaman (David Suchet). Knott's original play opened June 1952 in London, followed by a New York run that began October 1952. Several books and sources describe how Hitchcock's film was made in 3-D but neglect to mention that, despite trade screenings in 3-D, Dial M for Murder was originally released in 1954 with ordinary, flat 2-D prints. It was finally shown to audiences in 3-D during the mid-'80s(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Former Saturday Night Live "Weekend Update" co-anchors Tina Fey and Amy Poehler co-star in this baby-fever comedy about a single, career-oriented woman who previously put parenthood on hold, and is forced to hire a surrogate mother when she discovers there is only a one-in-a-million chance that she will be able to get pregnant. Kate Holbrook (Fey) is a 37-year-old business executive who has always put her professional life before her personal life, but these days her biological clock is ticking louder than ever before. As with everything else she has accomplished in life, Kate is determined to have a child on her own terms. Unfortunately for Kate, the chance of her ever becoming pregnant is slim to none. Undaunted, a willful Kate drafts South Philly working-class girl Angie Ostrowiski (Poehler) -- a woman who may just be her polar opposite -- to be a surrogate mother. Subsequently informed by the head of the surrogacy center (Sigourney Weaver) that her surrogate is indeed pregnant, the excited mother-to-be soon purchases every child-rearing book she can find and excitedly begins the nesting process. But life hasn't quit throwing Kate curveballs just yet, because when a pregnant Angie shows up on her doorstep with no place to live, the woman who once thrived on order finds her life descending into chaos. Now, as Kate attempts to transform Angie into the ideal expectant mother, this odd couple will discover that families aren't always biological, but occasionally formed through friendship as well. Writer Michael McCullers, who authored the screenplays for Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and Undercover Brother in addition to working on Saturday Night Live, makes his feature directorial debut with a self-penned screenplay(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Adapted from Mark Millar's hyper-violent comic book of the same name, director Matthew Vaughn's (Layer Cake) vigilante superhero film tells the tale of an average New York teenager who decides to don a costume and fight crime. Comic book geek Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) may not have good coordination or special powers, but that doesn't mean he isn't a fully capable crime fighter. After purchasing a flashy wet suit on the Internet, Dave starts busting up baddies with nothing but brute force. He calls himself Kick-Ass, and he can take a beating as good as he can dish one out. Before long, Kick-Ass has become a local sensation, and others are following his lead. Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) are a father-daughter crime-fighting duo who have set their sights on local mob heavy Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong). They're doing a decent job of dismantling Frank's sizable underworld empire when Kick-Ass gets drawn into the fray. But Frank's men play rough, and his son, Chris (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), is about to become Kick-Ass' very first arch nemesis. When Chris assumes the persona of Red Mist, the stage is set for a superhero showdown that could spell the end of Kick-Ass once and for all(n)</desc>

The stories of great Negro League players such as Satchel Paige, Josh Gibson, Cool Papa Bell, Judy Johnson, and Buck Leonard help set the stage for the history-making moment in 1942 when Jackie Robinson walked onto Ebbet's Field for the first time. Back in the Major Leagues, the program focuses on Lou Gehrig and Joe DiMaggio, the Yankees' challenge to Dizzy Dean and the Gas House Gang St. Louis Cardinals, and the impact of the Great Depression as inspiration for the first All-Star game(n)</desc>

Casey's newest protégé, Casey-Junior, is a six-week old ambassador Black Bear cub who will learn to walk, swim, climb, and forage, all for the first time under Casey's careful tutelage; but what starts out small doesn't stay that way as Casey embarks on an all-out quest to find Black Bears in the wild country of Maine's Big Woods. In this vibrant ecosystem, ancient rugged mountains, fertile bogs, rich moose habitat, and truly majestic wilderness hiking converge to form an unforgettable backdrop to Casey's quest to find and film Black Bears. And with one of the densest concentrations of black bears anywhere in the lower forty-eight states, action is sure to follow. In Maine, Casey discovers a wildness that rivals even his own Yellowstone; who knew that the East Coast could hide so much wild country? Meanwhile, Casey-Junior is growing - and he is tackling a series of increasingly difficult wild challenges: from raiding a beehive to foraging for berries. Before long, he'll have truly grown into a healthy young Black Bear . . . and going forward, the sky's the limit!(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Hurt Locker</title>
    <desc lang="en">Kathryn Bigelow's multiple-Oscar-winning film is a compelling fact-based, Iraq-set bomb disposal drama, scripted by journalist Mark Boal, drawing on his experiences while embedded with a United States Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal team in 2004. The focus is on the complex characters making up Bravo Company, who disable and destroy improvised explosive devices. The days are ticking down to the end of the bomb squad's tour, but their role puts the team in harm's way around the clock. And it doesn't help that one of the team is addicted to risk taking and pays scant attention to standard procedure, putting other lives in danger, as well as his own. The Hurt Locker provides a tense glimpse into the lives of these extraordinary men, and also probes the various psychologies of people whose job could kill them at any moment, as well as - briefly - exploring how they cope once away from their adrenaline-soaked vocation. Also starring Anthony Mackie, Ralph Fiennes, Guy Pearce, Brian Geraghty and Evangeline Lilly(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The film begins in 1965, when disc jockey Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams) is assigned to take over the AFR's Saigon radio broadcasts. In contrast to the dull, by-rote announcers that have preceded him, Cronauer is a bundle of dynamite, heralding each broadcast with a loud "Goooooood morning, Vietnaaaaam," playing whatever records tickle his fancy (even those not officially sanctioned by his hidebound superiors), and indulging in wild flights of improvisational fancy. Cronauer's immediate superior Lt. Hauk (Bruno Kirby), whose own notions of humor are puerile and pathetic, jealously attempts to dethrone Vietnam's favorite rock jock. Fortunately, Cronauer's popularity is such that he enjoys the full protection of the higher-ups. But when Cronauer, after experiencing the horrors of war first-hand, insists upon telling his listeners the truth instead of the official government line, he is instantly replaced by the unfunny Hauk and must struggle to get back on the air(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Father of Invention</title>
    <desc lang="en">An entrepreneur with a world-class ego has to rebuild his empire and his family relationships from scratch in this comedy. Robert Axle (Kevin Spacey) built a multi-million-dollar business out of selling household gadgets through television infomercials, and managed to alienate nearly everyone around him when fame and wealth turned him into an arrogant loudmouth. When one of Axle's products turns out to be dangerous and causes several thousand customers to lose a finger, he loses his fortune and spends eight years in prison for gross negligence. Back on the street, Axle is broke but determined to find a way back to the top, though he's just a bit more humble than he used to be and wants to win back the love of his daughter, Claire (Camilla Belle), whom he neglected as a child, and his ex-wife (Virginia Madsen). Things go badly for Axle on his first day working at a big-box discount store, and he's left with little alternative than to ask Claire to let him stay with her; she and her roommate, Fibbi (Heather Graham), aren't so sure this is a good idea, but they grudgingly agree and end up helping Axle in his bid to redeem himself. Father of Invention also stars Johnny Knoxville, Craig Robinson, and Michael Rosenbaum(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Sound and the Fury</title>
    <desc lang="en">James Franco directs this adaptation of William Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury, the writer's tale of the Compson family, a once wealthy Southern clan devolving into obscurity. Tim Blake Nelson portrays the patriarch, a boozy lawyer who oversees the lives of his children with cynical monologues delivered through an alcoholic haze. Quentin, the oldest child, goes to Harvard, but he's very close with Caddy, the only daughter in the family who has a child out of wedlock. Second son Jason attempts to rule the family with an iron fist, but he's full of resentment towards Caddy's bastard child. All of them attempt to care for the developmentally disabled Benjy (Franco). Franco employs a fractured approach to the narrative in an attempt to capture Faulkner's distinctive prose style. The Sound and the Fury screened at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Deep End of the Ocean</title>
    <desc lang="en">A drama that touches on the issues of the rights of adoptive vs. biological parents, and what is ultimately best for the child, The Deep End Of The Ocean stars Michelle Pfeiffer and Treat Williams as Beth and Pat Cappadora, working parents with three children. When Beth visits Chicago with the kids, she asks the oldest son to watch the youngest, three-year-old Ben, while she checks in to a hotel. When she returns a few minutes later, Ben has disappeared, nowhere to be found. Despite the best efforts of police detective Candy Bliss (Whoopi Goldberg), no trace of the boy can be discovered, and the loss has a profound effect on the family, especially Beth. Nine years later, a boy knocks on the Cappadoras' door, asking if they'd like him to mow their lawn. While Beth can hardly believe her first instinct, she soon discovers it's true -- the boy cutting the grass is actually Ben, who has been living with another family since his disappearance. While Ben is returned to the Cappadoras, the reunion isn't as blissful as everyone imagined at first; the family discovers Ben is in many ways a stranger to them, and Ben misses his adopted father, running away to be with him. Stephen Schiff based his screenplay on the 1996 novel by Jacquelyn Mitchard(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">First Sunday</title>
    <desc lang="en">Gospel-minded playwright David E. Talbert produces, writes, and directs this urban crime comedy concerning a pair of criminals who take a group of church parishioners hostage while attempting to rob the holy house, only to find their captives slowly convincing them to repent and give up their lawless lifestyles. Durell (Ice Cube) and LeeJohn (Tracy Morgan) are two best friends with a special knack for petty crime. Upset at discovering that his ex-girlfriend is planning to move out of state with the couple's young son, Durell knows that the only way to keep his fractured family in close proximity to one another is to raise the 17,000 dollars needed to pay off her growing debt. In order to get the money before his ex decides to make the big move, the desperate Durell enlists the aid of his scheming best buddy to rob their neighborhood church. But someone has beaten Durell and LeeJohn to the punch, and if they ever hope to get their hands on that quick cash, this bumbling pair will first have to spend an entire night in the presence of not just the almighty lord, but some of his most fervent followers as well.

    <desc lang="en">A young man tries to tie up some loose ends before he goes to war in this independent drama from director Neil Abramson. Mike Holland (Nick Cannon) is nineteen years old and has just completed his basic training as a private in the United States Marine Corps. Mike has a four-day leave so he can visit his family for Thanksgiving, and then has orders for combat duty in Iraq. Mike wants to spend time with his family and friends before he ships out, but he doesn't want to tell anyone that he'll be stationed in Iraq. While taking the bus home to Bakersfield, California, Mike meets Cristina (Melonie Diaz), and it doesn't take long for him to realize he's infatuated with her. Mike makes a date to spend some time with Cristina, but he already has a busy schedule over the next four days. Mike catches up with his little sister (Erica Gluck), his doting mother (April Grace) and her taciturn new husband (Tom Sizemore), and sees his estranged father (Chi McBride) for the first time in years. Mike also hangs out with his best friend Jake (Matt O'Leary), but discovers he's begun taking a different path in life while Mike was in boot camp. And Mike happens to meet a disabled soldier back from Iraq (Jay Hernandez) who gives him an idea of what he can expect during his tour of duty.

Roland (Taye Diggs) is a few hours away from getting married, and he is starting to have second thoughts; as much as he loves his fiancée, he can't stop thinking about Tanya (Tamala Jones), his first serious girlfriend in high school. Roland is hanging out with his two best friends, whom he also first met in school, Mike (Omar Epps), a solid regular guy, and Slim (Richard T. Jones), a flashy personality who plays pro basketball in Europe. They talk about the old days and flash back on growing up in Inglewood, California (nicknamed "The Wood") in the 1980's, when Run DMC and Eric B &amp; Rakim were the happening sounds, and guys used to argue over who was hotter, Vanity or Apollonia. At the last minute, Roland takes off, wanting to pay Tanya a visit, and Mike and Slim are determined to track him down and make sure that he gets to the altar on time. The Wood was the debut feature film for writer/director Rick Famuyiwa, whose first short subject, Blacktop Lingo, won an enthusiastic response at the 1996 Sundance Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Rookie</title>
    <desc lang="en">The true story of a middle-aged baseball rookie comes to the screen from Finding Forrester (2000) screenwriter Mike Rich and the studio behind the previous year's equally inspirational sports drama Remember the Titans (2001). Twelve years ago, the pro baseball aspirations of Texas pitcher Jim Morris (Dennis Quaid) were derailed by a severe shoulder injury. Jim became a high school science teacher and baseball coach, married his sweetheart, Lorri (Rachel Griffiths), and settled down to raise a family. After corrective surgery repairs, despite the longstanding damage to his shoulder, Jim discovers that he can pitch a ball even faster than he could before. When his team delivers a lackluster on-field performance in a losing game, coach and players agree to a wager: If they'll make it to the district championships, he'll try out for a major league ball club. When his team makes it to the championship and wins for the first time in the school's history, Jim is forced to live up to his end of the bargain. Nearly laughed off the field, he confounds the pro scouts by tossing successive fastballs that clock at nearly 100 miles per hour. It seems that Jim is about to live his dream of joining a major league team in middle age, when most players are planning their retirement. The Rookie (2002) co-stars Brian Cox, Beth Grant, and Jay Hernandez(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">People Are Alike All Over. Having scoffed at his colleague Warren Marcusson's (Paul Comi) assertion that "People are alike all over the universe," Astronaut Sam Conrad (Roddy McDowall) is given the opportunity to find out if Marcusson was telling the truth when his spaceship crash-lands on Mars. Though Marcusson is killed, Sam survives and is given the "red carpet" treatment by the humanlike Martians. Falling in love with the beautiful Teenya (Susan Oliver) and provided with a fully furnished luxury apartment, Sam is willing to concede that people everywhere are the same -- but just as the episode comes to an end, he realizes that this "sameness" is not an altogether good thing. Vic Perrin, who later provided the "control voice" on The Outer Limits, plays one of the Martian elders. Scripted by Rod Serling from Paul Fairman's short story "Brothers Beyond the Void," "People Are Alike All Over" made it Twilight Zone debut on March 25, 1960(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Third from the Sun</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Third from the Sun. Director Richard L. Bare made an impressive Twilight Zone debut with this classic episode. Fritz Weaver and Joe Maross star respectively as scientist William Sturka and test pilot Jerry Riden, who, aware that their country is on the brink of nuclear war, conspire to rescue themselves and their families by blasting off in an experimental spaceship. But first, the fugitives-to-be must escape the watchful eye of odious government functionary Carling (Edward Andrews). Though the episode's punch line is tipped off by its title, "Third from the Sun" scores points with some truly remarkable camerawork, courtesy of director Bare and cinematographer George Clemens. Scripted by Rod Serling from a short story by Richard Matheson, this episode first aired January 8, 1960(n)</desc>
