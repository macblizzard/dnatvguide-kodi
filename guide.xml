    <title lang="en">The Rocker</title>
    <desc lang="en">(2008) This comedy from The Full Monty director Peter Cattaneo stars Rainn Wilson as a man whose life has well and truly fallen apart. Twenty years previously, Robert 'Fish' Fishman (Wilson) was heavy rock band Vesuvius's drummer. But when Vesuvius were offered a support slot for Whitesnake on the condition that they ditch their drummer, Fish found himself packing his sticks. Two decades later, he's been sacked from his dead-end job, ditched by his girlfriend and forced to move into his sister's attic. However, he unexpectedly - and unwittingly - gets another bite at stardom while preparing for a one-off gig with his 18-year-old nephew Josh's (Matt Gadman) band. The only place Fish can find to rehearse in is very stuffy and humid, so - because he's on his own - he chooses to play naked. But he doesn't realise he's being recorded. And when the clip is posted on the web it goes viral... Network Premiere. M,W,S,HD(n)</desc>

Four aging former mobsters -- Joey "Bats" Pistella (Burt Reynolds), Bobby Bartellemeo (Richard Dreyfuss), Mike the Brick (Dan Hedaya), and Tony "The Mouth" Donato (Seymour Cassel) -- live in the same rundown Miami apartment complex, the Raj Mahal. New owners hope to clear out the current tenants and replace them with a younger, more lucrative clientele. But the veteran gangsters don't want to move, so to scrape up the extra rent money, they take a job executing the father of a Miami mob boss. They happen to know he's already dead, so all they have to do is make it look like they did the hit. Their problems start when loudmouthed ladies' man Tony tells too much to Ferris (Jennifer Tilly), a stripper, and soon she's talked him into murdering her mother (Lainie Kazan) in exchange for her silence. The Crew also features Carrie-Anne Moss as a detective and Jeremy Piven as a mob kingpin out to avenge his father's death(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Shawshank Redemption</title>
    <desc lang="en">Based on a story by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption is the directorial debut of screenwriter Frank Darabont. In 1946, a banker named Andy Dufresne is convicted of a double murder, even though he stubbornly proclaims his innocence. He's sentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine, where another lifer, Ellis "Red" Redding, picks him as the new recruit most likely to crack under the pressure. The ugly realities of prison life are quickly introduced to Andy: a corrupt warden,sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley, and inmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or beatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the hope of the truly innocent, which allow him to prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with the warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal business schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the prison staff. In exchange, he is able to improve the prison library and bring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates, including Red(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">After six Oscar-nominations, Martin Scorsese finally picked up the statuette for this stunning, gripping crime thriller, based on the equally superb Hong Kong original Infernal Affairs . Matt Damon plays Colin Sullivan, the protégé of Boston gangster Frank Costello who has been groomed through police academy to become Frank's ears and eyes in the police department. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Billy Costigan, a cop deliberately disgraced so he can infiltrate Costello's gang to get enough information to bring him down. But Costello begins to smell a rat and demands Sullivan get him the name of the insider while Costigan realises the net may be closing in before he can get the information he needs. Superb performances from the three leads, with Nicholson reined in by Scorsese, supplemented by Oscar-nominee Mark Wahlberg as the foul-mouthed Sgt Dignam and Martin Sheen as Captain Queenan, Costigan's handlers who Sullivan must get past to find out his identity(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The EastEnders actress looks back on her life and career in a special programme to mark her 90th birthday. She touches on the reasons she believes she was cast as Dot Cotton - a role she has played since 1985 - how in the early days a fellow cast member saw her as a rival, and the opportunities the soap has given her - from Bafta nominations to appearing on stage in Calendar Girls. There are also tributes from friends and colleagues including Danny Dyer, Adam Woodyatt, Gillian Taylforth, Rudolph Walker, Lacey Turner and Natalie Cassidy.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Death in Paradise</title>
    <desc lang="en">Another mystery for the cops on the Caribbean island of Saint Marie, where the sun shines all day and it seems half the residents are killers-in-waiting. However, it's all change for the team. Last week they waved goodbye to Humphrey Goodman. No one knows how Kris Marshall's character is bowing out of the show - will he walk off into the sunset with new love Martha, or will he meet a sticky end, like his predecessor Richard Poole (Ben Miller)? What we do know is that in his place is Ardal O'Hanlon as DI Jack Mooney, who first popped up in the two-part London special. His first Caribbean case sees the reopening of a seven-year-old murder when a tourist provides an alibi for the woman convicted of the crime.(n)</desc>

For the spot test, they must pierce and carve an intricate design into a lantern using a technique known as the `devil's work', and the throw down sees them back at the wheel, making as many rice bowls as they can in 15 minutes.(n)</desc>

He also finds out how Russian police are enacting new laws promising to get tough on any trouble-makers, and films an organised fight in the woods where one firm is `auditioning' new members.(n)</desc>

Southend single parent Donna also has plans to go into business, while for cancer survivor Kim and her partner Adam, just returning to normality is enough.

In the opening edition, she and her fellow passengers stop off in Nassau in the Bahamas, where Jane finds solace in the state's oldest baptist church, and St Martin, where she seeks an intimate underwater audience with a host of sharks.

Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) is a rare book broker who makes his living tracking down valuable items for rich bibliophiles. Corso is hired by Boris Balkan (Frank Langella), a millionaire New Yorker with a vast collection of occult literature and a keen interest in "The Nine Gates to the Kingdom of Shadows." Legend has it that the book was co-written by Satan in the 17th century, and only three copies are known to exist; the owner of one recently sold the book to Balkan a few days before killing himself. Balkan wants Corso to find the other two copies (one owned by a Mr. Fargas in Portugal and the other by a French collector named Kessler) and examine them to determine if they are forgeries. Corso is told to be thorough and spare no expense. He begins by visiting Liana Telfer (Lena Olin), the widow of the man who once owned Balkan's copy of the book, who has an unusually strong desire to get the book back, and confers with his friend Bernie (James Russo), who soon turns up dead, in a manner much like an illustration from the book. Corso learns that the book contains clues to a puzzle that will allow people to call up the devil, and certain people will stop at nothing to find the missing parts of the formula(n)</desc>

Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) is a rare book broker who makes his living tracking down valuable items for rich bibliophiles. Corso is hired by Boris Balkan (Frank Langella), a millionaire New Yorker with a vast collection of occult literature and a keen interest in "The Nine Gates to the Kingdom of Shadows." Legend has it that the book was co-written by Satan in the 17th century, and only three copies are known to exist; the owner of one recently sold the book to Balkan a few days before killing himself. Balkan wants Corso to find the other two copies (one owned by a Mr. Fargas in Portugal and the other by a French collector named Kessler) and examine them to determine if they are forgeries. Corso is told to be thorough and spare no expense. He begins by visiting Liana Telfer (Lena Olin), the widow of the man who once owned Balkan's copy of the book, who has an unusually strong desire to get the book back, and confers with his friend Bernie (James Russo), who soon turns up dead, in a manner much like an illustration from the book. Corso learns that the book contains clues to a puzzle that will allow people to call up the devil, and certain people will stop at nothing to find the missing parts of the formula(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Thirteen Days</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Roger Donaldson teams up with star Kevin Costner for another political thriller (after their 1987 pairing, No Way Out), only this time with a film based on the actual events surrounding the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, taking place during the titular thirteen days wherein the U.S. and the Soviet Union nearly engaged in full-scale nuclear war. After President John F. Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood) is shown photographs from a spy plane detailing the presence of missiles in Cuba capable of obliterating massive areas of the U.S., he must immediately decide the most effective course of action for the country. With the aid of best friend and special assistant Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner) and brother Robert (Steven Culp), the President must avoid a dire chain of events that could be dictated by General Curtis LeMay (Kevin Conway), who would rather take immediate action and invade Cuba. After initial reticence about leaking the information to the nation, President Kennedy eventually tells of the conflict, leading to widespread panic and a blockade of Cuba. With the aid of Robert McNamara (Dylan Baker) and Adlai Stevenson (Michael Fairman), the leaders must find a way to alleviate the tension of the situation. Thirteen Days also features Walter Adrian as Lyndon Johnson(n)</desc>

Now, in order to get out alive, The Fool will have to root out the killer in his midst, and make a quick escape before his co-workers catch him in their crosshairs.

Dave (Barry Watson), Adam (Michael Rosenbaum), and Doofer (Harland Williams) are a trio of broke playboy misogynists who are accused of embezzlement by their frat brothers and kicked out. The friends quickly find themselves with only one option if they wish to remain on campus rent-free and nab the real culprits: the sorority known as Delta Omicron Gamma (D.O.G.), an institution widely known for its members' deficiency of physical beauty. After undergoing radical transformations thanks to wigs, makeup, and some serious depilatory efforts, the boys are soon passing themselves off as Daisy, Adena, and Roberta. It's not long before their past mistreatment of women has come back to haunt them, while Dave falls in love with Leah (Melissa Sagemiller), the head of the sorority, forcing him to consider when and where to confess the truth. In the meantime, the boys draw closer to learning the identity of the real thieves. Sorority Boys (2002) co-stars Heather Matarazzo(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Day</title>
    <desc lang="en">A small band of friends make an uneasy alliance with a mysterious lone wolf in this blend of horror and adventure. An unnamed catastrophe has turned the Earth into a wasteland, and as packs of feral cannibals wander the countryside, a dwindling number of survivors struggle to stay alive. Rick (Dominic Monaghan), Adam (Shawn Ashmore), Henson (Cory Hardrict), and Shannon (Shannyn Sossamon) have been journeying together for months and are the last living members of a much larger group. Mary (Ashley Bell) is a solitary woman who crossed paths with the survivors and is now traveling with them. She isn't interested in discussing her past or becoming friends, but the others learn she's a powerful ally in a fight. The travelers take shelter in a house, but are soon surrounded by cannibals; they quickly realize just how strong a warrior Mary can be, while also discovering the terrible truth that led her to wander alone. The Day was directed by Douglas Aarniokoski, who has accumulated extensive credits as an assistant director and helming second-unit material on major films(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Elysium</title>
    <desc lang="en">In a future in which the privileged reside on an Earth-orbiting space station named Elysium and the less fortunate live on the surface of the blighted, overpopulated planet below, one man dares to defy the strict anti-immigration laws that separate the two disparate worlds in order to save all of mankind in this visceral sci-fi action thriller from District 9 director Neill Blomkamp. The year is 2154, and the division between social classes has grown wider than ever before. As the rich enjoy a life of luxury and access to cutting-edge medical technology on Elysium, the rest of the human race contend with poverty, crime, and disease on the surface of planet Earth. Meanwhile, hard-line immigration laws ensure that only those who have been explicitly approved will ever set foot on the elusive paradise in the stars. 36-year-old Max (Matt Damon) lives in an L.A. shantytown and earns his living by working on an Armadyne assembly line. He's had a rough past, but he's struggling to stay on the right side of the law when he realizes that his only hope for survival after being exposed to deadly radiation is to reach Elysium. Should Max succeed, he will strike a major blow for equality in the eyes of his fellow surface dwellers; should he fail, it will mean certain death. In his quest to become the hero who can restore the balance between the rich and the poor, however, Max must first do battle with Elysium's hawkish Secretary of Defense Delacourt (Jodie Foster), who has devoted her entire career to maintaining that division, and whose key enforcer Kruger (Sharlto Copley) is notorious for his brutal tactics in driving out illegals. With the fates of millions hanging in the balance, Max sets his sights on Elysium and never looks back. Alice Braga, Diego Luna, William Fichtner, and Faran Tahir co-star(n)</desc>

Once an ambitious D.A., Clayton is now a shell of his former dynamic self, thanks to a divorce, an unfortunate business venture, and astronomical debt. Though he longs to leave the cutthroat, ethically dubious world of corporate law behind, Clayton's poor financial situation and devotion to firm head Marty Bach (Sydney Pollack) leave him little choice but to remain on the job and tough it out. Meanwhile, litigator Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton) finds her entire company's future hinging on the outcome of a multi-billion-dollar settlement overseen by Clayton's friend, star lawyer Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson). When Edens snaps and decides to blow the whistle on the questionable case, sabotaging the defense, Clayton must decide between his loyalty and his conscience(n)</desc>

In Lost and Found, David Spade plays Dylan, who is about to open an new restaurant and has finally found the perfect apartment. The apartment just gets better when he meets his new neighbor, Lila (Sophie Marceau), a very beautiful women who has recently come to the United States from France. However, Lila has just gotten out of a bad relationship with René (Patrick Bruel), who doesn't want to leave her alone, so she has little interest in romance, preferring to devote herself to her cello and her dog Jack. One day, Jack runs away and Dylan finds him; when he returns the pooch to Lila, it's the first time she's been willing to speak in full sentences to him, though not for very long. Faster than you can say "That idea is so crazy it just might work!", Dylan decides to kidnap Jack; when Lila thinks the dog is lost, Dylan will generously volunteer to help look for him, which will give Dylan a chance to impress Lila when he's able to find Jack so quickly. Sure enough, Dylan swipes the dog, but from that point on the plan hardly goes the way he had hoped. Star David Spade also co-wrote the screenplay with J.B. Cook and Marc Meeks; the supporting cast includes Martin Sheen, Mitchell Whitfield, Artie Lang and Jon Lovitz(n)</desc>

Mick Dundee (Hogan) is still making his home in the tiny outback town of Walkabout Creek with his significant other Sue (Linda Kozlowski), and now joined by their young son Mikey (Serge Cockburn). Crocodile hunting has been made illegal, and Mick has been reduced to wrestling the animals for tourists. When an opportunity comes up for Sue to take over as L.A. bureau chief of a newspaper owned by her father, Mick and family cross the Pacific to California. There, Mick and his son's encounters with the natives cause more than a few cross-cultural mishaps, including a massive traffic jam on the freeway when the Dundees attempt an animal rescue. In the meantime, Mick becomes an amateur sleuth helping to probe the mysterious death of his wife's predecessor at the newspaper.

    <desc lang="en">The youngest child of the family often has the most problems -- so why should things be different for the Prince of Darkness and his offspring? Satan (Harvey Keitel) is considering retirement, and is pondering which of his sons should take over the family business -- ambitious Adrian (Rhys Ifans), strapping Cassius (Tommy "Tiny" Lister Jr.), or Nicky (Adam Sandler), an accident-prone demon who prefers to stay in his room playing his favorite heavy metal tunes. When Satan decides to stay on for another 10,000 years, Adrian is outraged, and leaves Hell to go to New York, where he and Cassius attempt to round up enough souls to vote Satan out of power. Satan, understandably upset, sends Nicky to bring Adrian and Cassius back home, but Nicky finds life on Earth is more complicated than he expected. Things don't get any easier when he develops a crush on Valerie (Patricia Arquette), a good-hearted mortal woman. Little Nicky also features Michael McKean as a city official trying to put Nicky behind bars, Kevin Nealon as Hell's gatekeeper, Rodney Dangerfield as Satan's father, Robert Smigel as the voice of Beefy -- a talking dog who is Nicky's guide on earth, Allen Covert as Todd -- Nicky's new roommate, and Peter Dante and Jonathan Loughran as a pair of metalheads who dig Satan.

    <desc lang="en">Set 100 miles south of the setting of the Polish brothers' first feature, Twin Falls Idaho, Jackpot tells the story of Sunny Holiday Jon Gries, a down-on-his-luck karaoke dweller who has hopes of becoming a country singer. He has abandoned his feisty wife Bobbi (Daryl Hannah) and young daughter to set off on a nine-month road odyssey with his manager Lester Irving (Garrett Morris), in an effort to collect cash at local karaoke gigs. Lester grooms Sunny by choosing what songs he will do, keeping up with what the judges are like, and negotiating with competitors like Sammy Bones (Mac Davis), another traveling hopeful. On his road journey, he encounters several women, including Janice (Peggy Lipton), a club waitress, and Cheryl (Crystal Bernard), whom he takes home after she has an accident in a restroom, only to find himself being enticed by her underage daughter Tangerine (Camellia Clouse). The road trip comes to a stop, however, when Sunny is pulled over by police who claim that his vehicle is stolen and that Bobbi has reported it. Sunny then seeks refuge with brother Tracy (Anthony Edwards) while he decides his next move. Jackpot is the first released film to be shot with the 24P HDTV camera, which was then blown up to Cinemascope 35 mm format(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Romantic comedy directed by Adam Brooks. Ryan Reynolds plays Will Hayes, an advertising executive whose marriage is on the cusp of ending in divorce. But before it does, his 10-year-old daughter Maya asks her father to explain how he met her mother. Instead of giving her a straight answer, Reynolds recounts his relationships with three women over the previous 16 years, changing their names and then inviting Maya to guess which woman he married. So, did Reynolds fall for his college sweetheart Emily; the kooky apolitical friend April he met while working on the Bill Clinton campaign in 1992; or is she the ambitious, carefree journalist Summer?(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Last Mimzy</title>
    <desc lang="en">An intergalactic package discovered on the beach holds a myriad of fantastic discoveries for siblings Noah and Emma Wilder in The Last Mimzy, studio head-turned-director Bob Shaye's wondrous sci-fi fantasy parable. The children stumble onto their discovery amid a trip to the family beach house, and find inside of the crate strange crystals that Emma levitates with her mind, as well as the Mimzy -- a stuffed bunny with a built-in supercomputer that advances its possessor's brain by great leaps and bounds by whispering into the person's ear. Meanwhile, via interaction with the box and its contents, Noah gains the ability to converse with spiders and instructs them to build miniature bridges. He also etches complex Tibetan mandalas, and somehow manages to black out half of Seattle. The children naturally keep these happenings (and the box) from their mom and dad (Joely Richardson and Timothy Hutton), but in time the kids set their sights higher and embark on correcting huge problems that cannot be missed. Rainn Wilson (The Office) co-stars as the children's hippie science teacher; New Age expert Bruce Joel Rubin (Ghost, Jacob's Ladder) and Toby Emmerich co-authored the script, adapting the 1943 short story Mimsy Were the Borogoves, by Lewis Padgett(n)</desc>

Devon Miles (Nick Cannon) is a talented young percussionist from Harlem who wins a music scholarship to Atlanta A &amp; T, a prestigious African-American university. For years, Atlanta A &amp; T has won awards for their show-style marching band, who combine expert musicianship (incorporating funk, R&amp;B, and jazz rhythms into the traditional marching band repertoire) with choreography, dancing cheerleaders, and roof-raising showmanship. Dr. Aaron Lee (Orlando Jones), the school's band director, gives Devon a spot in the marching band's drumline, the heart and soul of a show-style band, but discovers Devon's previous musical education hardly meets his usual standard when he learns that his new drummer can't read music. Devon soon earns a reputation as a stubborn individualist within the band, not necessarily a good thing in an ensemble where a strictly unified performance is considers the ideal. Devon's cocksure attitude and streetwise style doesn't mesh very comfortably with Sean Taylor (Leonard Roberts), a disciplined senior who resents the presence of the upstart freshman in the drumline, and things become even less harmonious when Devon begins making a play for Laila (Zoe Saldana), a beautiful girl who is also being courted by Sean. Songwriter and record producer Dallas Austin, who has worked with Boyz II Men, TLC, and Pink, served as executive producer for Drumline, helped produce the film's musical score, and contributed his own experiences as a marching band member to the screenplay(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The youngest child of the family often has the most problems -- so why should things be different for the Prince of Darkness and his offspring? Satan (Harvey Keitel) is considering retirement, and is pondering which of his sons should take over the family business -- ambitious Adrian (Rhys Ifans), strapping Cassius (Tommy "Tiny" Lister Jr.), or Nicky (Adam Sandler), an accident-prone demon who prefers to stay in his room playing his favorite heavy metal tunes. When Satan decides to stay on for another 10,000 years, Adrian is outraged, and leaves Hell to go to New York, where he and Cassius attempt to round up enough souls to vote Satan out of power. Satan, understandably upset, sends Nicky to bring Adrian and Cassius back home, but Nicky finds life on Earth is more complicated than he expected. Things don't get any easier when he develops a crush on Valerie (Patricia Arquette), a good-hearted mortal woman. Little Nicky also features Michael McKean as a city official trying to put Nicky behind bars, Kevin Nealon as Hell's gatekeeper, Rodney Dangerfield as Satan's father, Robert Smigel as the voice of Beefy -- a talking dog who is Nicky's guide on earth, Allen Covert as Todd -- Nicky's new roommate, and Peter Dante and Jonathan Loughran as a pair of metalheads who dig Satan.

    <title lang="en">Paradise Road</title>
    <desc lang="en">On February 10, 1942, a military fete held at the Raffles Hotel in Singapore is disrupted when the Japanese bomb the island. All women and children are placed upon a ship. The Japanese sink the vessel and a few survivors end up on the islands of Sumatra where they are promptly captured by the enemy and interned in segregated camps. In one such camp is a multinational group of European women. Featuring a distinguished female cast, this is the uplifting story of how the women overcame their considerable social and personality differences in the face of brutality and deprivation to form a women's choir that sang complex, wordless and symphonic arrangements of classical music. Filmmaker Bruce Beresford spent two years researching the story and interviewing survivors. For the musical sequences, he used the actual musical arrangements of the prisoners. Conditions at the camp are wretched and many of their Japanese guards brutally humiliate and torment the women at every turn. At first the ladies, who come from various walks of life, do not get along, but it doesn't take long before they figure out that the only way to survive is to unite. The vocal orchestra was dreamed up by British inmate Adrienne Pargiter (Glenn Close) who graduated from the royal Academy of Music. She is assisted by fellow music lover Margaret Drummond (Pauline Collins), an Australian missionary. At first no one in camp wants to take the risk involved in singing (which is forbidden), but eventually the other women are coerced into joining. Though the guards sometimes brutally interrupt their practices, the women persist and eventually win some of the guards over with their music. They are eventually allowed to perform publicly(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">P.S. I Love You</title>
    <desc lang="en">A grieving widow finds her husband's warmth radiating from the afterlife when she discovers that he left her a series of tasks to be revealed in ten monthly messages and designed to help her overcome her sorrow while gradually making the transition into a new life. Holly Kennedy (Hilary Swank) is a New York real estate broker whose good-humored husband, Irishman Gerry (Gerard Butler), always stood by her side. Suddenly, and seemingly out of nowhere, Gerry succumbs to a brain tumor and Holly is left to face an uncertain future. No one in the world knows Holly better than Gerry, not even her mother (Kathy Bates) or her best friends, Sharon (Gina Gershon) and Denise (Lisa Kudrow). But while Holly remains unsure if she can go on without the love of her life to help guide her, Gerry has planned ahead. On Holly's 30th birthday, she receives a cake and a special tape recording from Gerry that implores her to get out and celebrate instead of staying in and mourning. Later, as the months wear on, a series of additional messages arrive from Gerry -- always delivered in the most remarkable and surprising of ways. With each new message comes a new adventure, and each letter signs off in the same familiar way: "P.S. I love you." Despite the fact that Holly's mother and friends think these humorous, posthumous messages are keeping Holly bound to the past, the truth is that they are lovingly guiding her into the future while proving that sometimes death isn't just the end, but a new beginning as well. Director Richard LaGravenese teams with screenwriter Steve Rogers to adapt author Cecelia Ahern's best-selling novel(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Push</title>
    <desc lang="en">Lucky Number Slevin director Paul McGuigan takes the helm for this action thriller concerning a group of telekinetic American ex-patriots who band together in an attempt to take down the clandestine government agency that's genetically transforming normal citizens into powerful psychic warriors. The Division is a shadowy government operation devoted to making humankind the ultimate weapon. Those who accept this transformation have the power to move objects with the mind, see the future before it happens, create new realities, and dispense of their enemies without so much as a single touch; those who are unwilling to participate are immediately terminated. Nick Gant (Chris Evans) is a "mover," a second-generation telekinetic who went into hiding after the Division killed his father more than a decade earlier. He lives a life of anonymity in Hong Kong, a densely populated place where fugitive psychics such as himself are safe as long as they can keep their unique gift secret. Suddenly into Nick's life comes 13-year-old "watcher" Cassie Holmes (Dakota Fanning), a clairvoyant who needs his help in tracking down escaped "pusher" Kira, who may hold the key to bringing down the Division once and for all. A "pusher" is the most powerful kind of psychic due to his or her ability to influence the actions of others by planting thoughts in their minds. Now, as Nick emerges from hiding in order to help Cassie find Kira, the Division's human bloodhounds are hot on their trail. In order to elude the authorities, they'll need to disappear into the seedy underbelly of the city while relying on a team of rogue psychics to help cover their tracks. But Division Agent Henry Carver (Djimon Hounsou) is a powerful pusher who has made it his mission to stop them at all costs, regardless of the collateral damages that may occur in the process(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Peep World</title>
    <desc lang="en">A family's dirty laundry get aired out in public, and not everyone is happy about it in this dark comedy from director Barry W. Blaustein. Nathan (Ben Schwartz) is a writer who has recently published a best-selling novel that's being made into a major motion picture. Nathan is feeling very good about himself, but his siblings aren't so happy for him -- the book is a very thinly disguised version of his family's wildly dysfunctional history, and nearly everyone close to him can see themselves in its key characters. Nathan's older sister, Cheri (Sarah Silverman), a struggling actress, is so outraged that she's considering taking her brother to court, especially since the film version of the book is being shot outside her apartment and her father's new (and much younger) girlfriend (Alicia Witt) has been cast in the role patterned after her. Nathan's book has also become a thorn in the side of wildly irresponsible Joel (Rainn Wilson), who is on the run from loan sharks, and Jack (Michael C. Hall), whose career as an architect is crumbling almost as quickly as his marriage to Laura (Judy Greer). When the family gathers to celebrate the 70th birthday of their father (Ron Rifkin), along with their mother (Lesley Ann Warren) and her new husband (Nicholas Hormann), it makes for an evening with explosive potential. Peep World also features narration by comedian Lewis Black(n)</desc>

When a thick fog descends upon a rural community and claims the lives of anyone unfortunate enough to be caught outside, a small band of survivors seeks refuge in a local grocery store. Now trapped in a darkened cloud of pure horror, the frightened denizens of the town are forced to fend off an advancing horde of murderous monsters.

It is 1985 and Richard Nixon continues his tenure in the White House, massively popular with the electorate following his crushing defeat of the Viet Cong. However, it seems that the American public have fallen out of love with their superheroes, one of whom, Dr Manhattan, was largely responsible for the winning the Vietnam War. Now, he and his fellow crime-fighters are regarded as reprehensible vigilantes and have been banned by law. But, when one of their number - the vile, ironically named Comedian - is murdered, the former heroes begin to re-emerge from the shadows to investigate. They discover that a terrifying plan is afoot... Also starring Matthew Goode, Malin Akerman, Patrick Wilson and Jackie Earle Haley(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Muncie is convinced Manuel has now committed four murders, but William Watt is arrested on suspicion of killing his wife, daughter and sister-in-law, despite having been on a fishing trip at the time. With no arrest made following Anne Kneiland's murder, Muncie is determined to get the truth and visits Manuel's father, who has given his son the alibi he needed to be free of police suspicion. While Muncie finally casts enough suspicion on Watt's arrest to have him released, it is not long before another young girl goes missing.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The day after Isabelle Cooke disappears, Manuel hands himself in to Muncie with an alibi for his movements of the previous 24 hours, leaving him free once again. Four days later Peter and Doris Smart and their 12-year-old son are shot dead in their beds. The killer takes care to dispose of their bodies and the gun used to do the deed, but also pockets 15 one-pound notes found in Peter Smart's wallet. On discovering that the previously flat-broke Manuel had been generously buying rounds of drinks on New Year's Day, Muncie begins to put the pieces of the puzzle together, and begins to close in on the Beast of Birkenshaw.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Crash</title>
    <desc lang="en">(2004) Paul Haggis won two Oscars for his major feature debut as director and co-writer. Set in Los Angeles over two days, it is a picaresque, episodic film with a cast of disparate characters whose lives coincide for one reason or another, from racist cop John Ryan (Matt Dillon) who pulls over black TV director Cameron Thayer (Terrence Howard) and his wife Christine (Thandie Newton), to the simple hassles that Iranian Farad (Shaun Toub) encounters. Haggis shows a city where racism and its manifestations are easily encountered but where those at both the giving and receiving end are not simple ciphers but complex human beings whose intolerance is caused by both personal problems and issues within society at large.

    <title lang="en">The Hurt Locker</title>
    <desc lang="en">Kathryn Bigelow's compelling fact-based, Iraq-set bomb disposal drama was scripted by journalist Mark Boal, drawing on his experiences while embedded with a United States Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal team in 2004. The focus is on the complex characters making up Bravo Company, who disable and destroy improvised explosive devices. The days are ticking down to the end of the bomb squad's tour, but their role puts the team in harm's way around the clock. And it doesn't help that one of the team is addicted to risk taking and pays scant attention to standard procedure, putting other lives in danger, as well as his own. The Hurt Locker provides a tense glimpse into the lives of these extraordinary men, and also probes the various psychologies of people whose job could kill them at any moment, as well as - briefly - exploring how they cope once away from their adrenaline-soaked vocation(n)</desc>

Haggis shows a city where racism and its manifestations are easily encountered but where those at both the giving and receiving end are not simple ciphers but complex human beings whose intolerance is caused by both personal problems and issues within society at large.

Fifteen years ago, an elusive serial killer known as The Wolf claimed the lives of 15 young girls. Thanks to the work of Detectives Elliott Carbon (John Rhys-Davies) and Johnny Morgan ( Andrew Cymek), The Wolf was eventually captured, locked up, and placed in the care of Dr. Parker (William B. Davis). When the facility loses power and the lights go dark, however, The Wolf and the rest of the inmates seize the opportunity to reclaim their freedom. Now trapped in these winding corridors with a rampaging gang of maniacs, madmen, and murderers, Johnny and Dr. Parker must fight to survive the night, and ensure that no one escapes before order is restored(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A handful of inner-city kids move up to the big time in this teen-centric musical. Xavier Smith (Bow Wow), known to his friends as X, is a teenager growing up on the South Side of Chicago in the late '70s. X and his buddies are the hotshot skaters at the Palisades Gardens, a neighborhood roller rink where local kids roll to the latest disco sounds, but X loses his status as king of the hill when the Palisades closes down. With no skating action close by, X and his friends head uptown to the Sweetwater Roller Rink, where they feel like country mice in the big city among the expert skate dancers and beautiful women. But skating means a lot to X -- with his widower father, Curtis (Chi McBride) going through a bad patch, skating gives him a sense of accomplishment and a belief in his own talent. So X and company keep heading uptown to Sweetwater, where they prepare to take on Sweetness (Wesley Jonathan) and his crew of the rink's best dancers for the upcoming Roller Jam Skate-Off. X befriends a young local girl named Tori (Jurnee Smolett) and finds a good reason to go uptown when he meets a pretty skater girl, Naomi (Meagan Good). Meanwhile, Tori's mother, Vivian (Kellita Smith) takes an interest in Curtis. Featuring a score of classic '70s R&amp;B and disco, Roll Bounce was directed by Malcolm D.

    <title lang="en">Something New</title>
    <desc lang="en">A woman discovers that when it comes to love, sometimes opposites really do attract in this romantic comedy-drama. Kenya (Sanaa Lathan) is a successful African-American lawyer in her mid-thirties whose personal life is not going as well as her career. While she's attractive and intelligent, Kenya has rather high standards and isn't willing to settle for a man who isn't everything she wants. While attending a party, Kenya is introduced to Brian (Simon Baker), a landscape architect who handles the gardening at her host's mansion. Brian is immediately and obviously attracted to Kenya, through she doesn't feel the same way at all. However, she likes his work and hires him to refurbish her garden; before long, he asks her out on a date, and against her better judgment she accepts. While Kenya and Brian have little in common, in time they hit it off, and a romance begins to blossom between them. However, Brian happens to be white, which ruffles some feathers among Kenya's friends and family, who try to find her a more suitable, African-American suitor. Also starring Mike Epps, Donald Faison, Blair Underwood, and Alfre Woodard, Something New was the first feature film for director Sanaa Hamri, who previously established herself by directing music videos(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Twisted. Moving from its longtime Sunday-night timeslot to a Saturday-evening berth, Married. . .With Children launched its eleventh and final season on September 28, 1996 with an extended takeoff of the then-current film hit Twister. Bud Bundy (David Faustino) fakes a tornado in order to frighten his girl Ariel (Jennifer Lyons) into his arms--and, hopefully, into the sack. Alas, a real tornado foils this scheme, forcing the Bundys and the D'Arcys to take shelter in Bud's bedroom. This episode was slightly edited for content when it entered off-network syndication, but was subsequently seen intact on the FX cable channel(n)</desc>
