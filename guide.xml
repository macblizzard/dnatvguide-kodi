    <title lang="en">Ghost World</title>
    <desc lang="en">Filmmaker Terry Zwigoff, who enjoyed breakthrough success with his 1994 documentary Crumb, shifts gears as he examines the lives of two young women on the verge of leaving their adolescence behind in his first dramatic feature. Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) are two close friends who've just graduated from high school, and are trying to decide what to do with their lives. Enid is a dark-haired arch cynic who is tired of living at home with her ineffectual dad (Bob Balaban) and his annoyingly perky girlfriend Maxine (Teri Garr), while Rebecca is prettier and a bit cheerier, but no more certain about her future. While the two girls have vague plans of getting an apartment together, they seem content to while away their summer hanging out and indulging in their shared infatuation with Josh (Brad Renfro), a friend from school who works at a convenience store and doesn't seem to be especially attracted to either of them. Enid discovers that in order to get her diploma, she'll have to take an additional class over the summer, where she winds up studying art with Roberta (Illeana Douglas), who is determined to encourage Enid's creative impulses, whether Enid likes it or not. More significantly, Enid meets Seymour (Steve Buscemi), a geeky record collector more than twice her age, and while they would seem to have little in common (and Rebecca thinks he's a creep), Enid discovers a kindred spirit in fellow misfit Seymour, who shares her disgust with the world around them, and a relationship begins to develop between the two. Ghost World is based on the award-winning graphic novel by comic artist Daniel Clowes, who also wrote the film's screenplay(n)</desc>

Ultimately, the mother and daughter are able to relocate to an apartment, which, despite its excessively dilapidated interior, seems to be an adequate location for beginning a new life. Before long, however, what appears to be the spirit of a young girl begins to haunt them.

As time goes by and the apparent haunting does not subside, the apartment's new residents are forced to examine the history of its former tenants. Dark Water also features performances from John C. Reilly, Tim Roth, and Dougray Scott(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">I Am Legend</title>
    <desc lang="en">Adapted from acclaimed author Richard Matheson's influential novelette of the same name, Constantine director Francis Lawrence's I Am Legend follows the last man on Earth as he struggles to survive while fending off the infected survivors of a devastating vampiric plague. A brilliant scientist who raced to discover a cure for the man-made virus as humanity came crumbling down all around him, Robert Neville (Will Smith) was inexplicably immune to the highly contagious superbug. Now the entire population of New York City -- and perhaps the world -- has been transformed into carnivorous bloodsuckers that fear the light and live solely to spread their contagion to any remaining living creature that crosses their path. It's been three years since civilization came to an end, and the loneliness has taken a devastating toll on Neville. By day he scours the city for food and supplies while sending out desperate radio messages in hopes that someone might respond, and by night he attempts to find a way to reverse the effects of the virus by experimenting with his own blood. But time is running out for Neville as the legions of infected watch his every move from the safety of the shadows, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. They, too, long to learn the secret that lurks in Neville's blood, though they will have to take caution while attempting to procure it because Neville will sooner die attempting to slay every last one of them than willingly giving up a single drop. Previously adapted for the screen in the 1964 Vincent Price frightener The Last Man on Earth and the 1971 Charlton Heston action film The Omega Man, Matheson's novelette also served as the inspiration for George A. Romero's groundbreaking zombie classic Night of the Living Dead(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Neil Brand celebrates the art of the film soundtrack by exploring the work of movie composers and demonstrating their techniques. He begins by looking at how the classical orchestral score emerged, and investigates how its popularity remains strong today. He sheds light on the 1930s European composers such as Max Steiner and Erich Wolfgang Korngold, who brought their Viennese training to Hollywood for movies including King Kong and The Adventures of Robin Hood, and how it took an American talent to produce a darker, more modern sound. He also meets film-maker Martin Scorsese and composer Hans Zimmer to discuss their work.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">The Forth Rail Bridge.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Engineer Rob Bell sets out on a journey to discover how six of Britain's most stunning bridges were designed and built. Completed in 1890, the Forth Rail Bridge now carries around 200 trains every day. The last of the great Victorian engineering triumphs, it has grown to symbolise Scotland as much as Edinburgh Castle, bagpipes or kilts. But, as Rob learns, this incredible engineering achievement was born from the tragedy of the 1879 Tay Bridge disaster, and 73 deaths were connected with its construction and immediate aftermath.(n)</desc>

Bender asks what it would be like if he were 500 feet tall, so he becomes a giant and flies to Earth to the tune of Black Sabbath's "Iron Man." He befriends a boy (Fry) and accidentally destroys the city in a take on The Iron Giant. The Professor then makes Dr. Zoidberg a giant so they can fight each other. Leela asks what it would be like if she were more impulsive, so she ends up killing the Professor in order to get his fortune. As people find out about the murder, she is forced to kill them one by one until she has killed almost everyone. Fry asks what it would be like if he were never cryogenically frozen in 1999. He ends up meeting the Action Rangers -- made up of scientist Stephen Hawking, Vice President Al Gore, Star Trek actress Nichelle Nichols, and Dungeons and Dragons creator Gary Gygax(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">What killed Tutankhamun? Ever since the tomb of the boy king was discovered in 1922, he has become arguably the most famous pharaoh of all ancient Egypt. But his mysterious death at just 19 years of age has never been explained. Now, Dallas Campbell reveals new scientific research aimed at getting to the truth. A CT scan of the pharaoh's mummified body creates a full-size image of the real Tutankhamun, while DNA analysis uncovers a shocking secret about his family background - and the genetic trail leads to a revolutionary new theory about his sudden and unexpected death.(n)</desc>

Japan's leaders believed that if they could inflict sufficient casualties on enemy forces, the Allies would give up, and American president Harry S Truman realised that there was only one way to force this fanatical enemy into surrendering, and decided to deploy the atomic bomb.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The concluding programme looks at how Japan's forces waged a savage defence campaign despite a hopeless position, with US carriers and amphibious forces roaming at will across the Pacific and submarines cutting vital supply lines to the mainland.

    <desc lang="en">Though household pets have been trained over thousands of years, they were wild for millions more, and despite the fact that many have taken well to domestic life and provide valuable companionship, their natural instincts remain latent, but are able to be rekindled. David Tennant narrates the first of two programmes revealing the nation's favourite pets in a new light. From playful puppies to hamsters running on the wheel, via chirping budgerigars and scratching cats, the documentary illustrates how these apparently innocuous behavioural traits often conceal a more primitive significance. Cameras visit two islands in Japan, one crowded by rabbits and the other cats, while in Peru dogs leave their home comforts behind on a daily basis to meet up, fight and attempt to attract the interest of a bitch on heat.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Biscuits.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Having shown they have what it takes to bake a cake or two, the 11 remaining contestants turn their attention to biscuits. First up they create their signature savoury crackers for cheese, and are encouraged to push the flavour. In the technical challenge, they have to prepare Mary Berry's Florentines, with their chewy caramel sauce and brandy-snap texture, before ending with a showstopper like no other - three-dimensional scenes made entirely from biscuits. For one hopeful, there will be the pride of being crowned Star Baker, while another will be sent home - well aware that that's just the way the cookie crumbles. Hosted by Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">John Torode and Gregg Wallace set finalists Dale, Larkin and Natalie a test to come up with one spectacular dish from an array of fine dining ingredients. But to crank up the pressure, they bring in guest judge Michael Caines, a chef with a fearsome reputation. Then comes the penultimate challenge, in which they prepare one course each of a three-course meal to be judged by four chefs who each hold the coveted three Michelin stars - Clare Smyth, Jonny Lake, Jocelyn Herland and Jocky Petrie. As tomorrow's final cook-off draws nearer, this is their chance to show the best of the best that they have what it takes to one day join their ranks.(n)</desc>

Kate Holbrook (Fey) is a 37-year-old business executive who has always put her professional life before her personal life, but these days her biological clock is ticking louder than ever before. As with everything else she has accomplished in life, Kate is determined to have a child on her own terms. Unfortunately for Kate, the chance of her ever becoming pregnant is slim to none. Undaunted, a willful Kate drafts South Philly working-class girl Angie Ostrowiski (Poehler) -- a woman who may just be her polar opposite -- to be a surrogate mother. Subsequently informed by the head of the surrogacy center (Sigourney Weaver) that her surrogate is indeed pregnant, the excited mother-to-be soon purchases every child-rearing book she can find and excitedly begins the nesting process. But life hasn't quit throwing Kate curveballs just yet, because when a pregnant Angie shows up on her doorstep with no place to live, the woman who once thrived on order finds her life descending into chaos. Now, as Kate attempts to transform Angie into the ideal expectant mother, this odd couple will discover that families aren't always biological, but occasionally formed through friendship as well. Writer Michael McCullers, who authored the screenplays for Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and Undercover Brother in addition to working on Saturday Night Live, makes his feature directorial debut with a self-penned screenplay(n)</desc>

Kate Holbrook (Fey) is a 37-year-old business executive who has always put her professional life before her personal life, but these days her biological clock is ticking louder than ever before. As with everything else she has accomplished in life, Kate is determined to have a child on her own terms. Unfortunately for Kate, the chance of her ever becoming pregnant is slim to none. Undaunted, a willful Kate drafts South Philly working-class girl Angie Ostrowiski (Poehler) -- a woman who may just be her polar opposite -- to be a surrogate mother. Subsequently informed by the head of the surrogacy center (Sigourney Weaver) that her surrogate is indeed pregnant, the excited mother-to-be soon purchases every child-rearing book she can find and excitedly begins the nesting process. But life hasn't quit throwing Kate curveballs just yet, because when a pregnant Angie shows up on her doorstep with no place to live, the woman who once thrived on order finds her life descending into chaos. Now, as Kate attempts to transform Angie into the ideal expectant mother, this odd couple will discover that families aren't always biological, but occasionally formed through friendship as well. Writer Michael McCullers, who authored the screenplays for Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and Undercover Brother in addition to working on Saturday Night Live, makes his feature directorial debut with a self-penned screenplay(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">A Serious Man</title>
    <desc lang="en">Filmmaking duo Joel and Ethan Coen write, produce, and direct this period black comedy set in 1967 concerning a Midwestern physics professor whose staid and stable life slowly begins to unravel after his wife announces that she's leaving him. As if the failure of his longtime marriage wasn't enough for Larry Gopnik (Tony-nominated Michael Stuhlbarg) to contend with, now his socially inept brother refuses to move out of the house as well. Larry is a modest man of science. Up to this point, his life has been uneventful at best, but things are about to get interesting. When his wife, Judith, announces that she is leaving him to move in with his smug colleague Sy Ableman, Larry does his best to contend with his failed marriage while barely tolerating his unemployable brother, Arthur, who appears to have grown roots on Larry's couch. Meanwhile, Larry's son, Danny, is getting into trouble at Hebrew school, and his daughter, Sarah, is stealthily snatching money from his wallet so she can afford a nose job. As Judith and Sy merrily begin making plans for their new life of domestic bliss together, Larry begins receiving a series of anonymous letters from someone who seems intent on sabotaging his chance for tenure at the university. To further complicate matters, a graduate student with failing grades is attempting to bribe the professor while simultaneously threatening him with a defamation lawsuit. Larry is in some serious need of equilibrium, though it's hard to focus on getting your life in order when your beautiful neighbor insists on sunbathing in the nude just outside your window. Perhaps by seeking the advice of three trusted rabbis, Larry can finally learn to cope with his afflictions and become a genuine mensch. A Serious Man is the second in a two-picture deal that the siblings made with Focus Features and Working Title. The first film in the deal, entitled Burn After Reading and starring Brad Pitt, George Clooney, and Frances McDormand, was released nationwide in September 2008(n)</desc>

Arranged as an episodic comedy, the film follows a group of friends who live in the same apartment building and hang out at the same coffee shop. The central couple is Steve Dunne (Campbell Scott) and Linda Powell (Kyra Sedgwick), a pair who meet at an Alice In Chains concert and eventually fall in love. Singles follows the tumultuous relationship between Steve and Linda and their friendship with Janet Livermore (Bridget Fonda), who is trying to win the affection of grunge-rocker Cliff Poncier (Matt Dillon). The film also has a number of cameos, including actors Eric Stoltz, Tom Skerritt, Peter Horton, director Tim Burton and the film's author/director, Cameron Crowe. From the musical side of the fence, Singles features appearances by Sub Pop executive Bruce Pavitt, musicians Chris Cornell (Soundgarden), Pat DiNizio (Smithereens), Tad (Tad), and Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder, Jeff Ament, and Stone Gossard, who play Dillon's backing band, Citizen Dick(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Former Saturday Night Live "Weekend Update" co-anchors Tina Fey and Amy Poehler co-star in this baby-fever comedy about a single, career-oriented woman who previously put parenthood on hold, and is forced to hire a surrogate mother when she discovers there is only a one-in-a-million chance that she will be able to get pregnant. Kate Holbrook (Fey) is a 37-year-old business executive who has always put her professional life before her personal life, but these days her biological clock is ticking louder than ever before. As with everything else she has accomplished in life, Kate is determined to have a child on her own terms. Unfortunately for Kate, the chance of her ever becoming pregnant is slim to none. Undaunted, a willful Kate drafts South Philly working-class girl Angie Ostrowiski (Poehler) -- a woman who may just be her polar opposite -- to be a surrogate mother. Subsequently informed by the head of the surrogacy center (Sigourney Weaver) that her surrogate is indeed pregnant, the excited mother-to-be soon purchases every child-rearing book she can find and excitedly begins the nesting process. But life hasn't quit throwing Kate curveballs just yet, because when a pregnant Angie shows up on her doorstep with no place to live, the woman who once thrived on order finds her life descending into chaos. Now, as Kate attempts to transform Angie into the ideal expectant mother, this odd couple will discover that families aren't always biological, but occasionally formed through friendship as well. Writer Michael McCullers, who authored the screenplays for Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and Undercover Brother in addition to working on Saturday Night Live, makes his feature directorial debut with a self-penned screenplay(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Jim Carrey and Virginia Madsen star in this dark psychological thriller from director Joel Schumacher. Walter Sparrow is leading a contented life until his wife Agatha innocently gives him a battered old paperback as a gift. As he reads, Sparrow is astonished by the parallels between his life and that of the novel's protagonist, Fingerling. But as the plot progresses it grows darker, featuring themes of transgressive sex, suicide and murder. It also hinges around Fingerling's obsession with the number 23 - a prime number that seems to pop up everywhere in the universe once you start to notice it. It's not long before 23 takes a similar hold on Sparrow. And, when he begins unjustly to view Agatha in the same distrustful light that Fingerling views his own spouse Fabrizia, it seems as if Sparrow has locked on to the same tragic trajectory as the story's lead character. Or can he find a way to wrench himself from the novel's grip?(n)</desc>

But after a series of public controversies Jason's career has hit the skids, prompting the fans to write him off as a one-hit-wonder.

It turns out that the operation was also laundering money for the mob, so he agrees to help prosecutors build a case against the other executives and testify in court in exchange for going into hiding. George packs up his much younger second wife (Denise Richards), his bitter teenage daughter (Danielle Campbell), his neglected younger son (Devan Leos), and his dementia-addled mother (Doris Roberts), and together they travel to the safe house that Brian (Tyler Perry), the case's lead prosecutor, has chosen for them.

    <desc lang="en">An upstanding businessman finds his upcoming marriage thrown into question when his connection with a down-on-her-luck cleaning woman turns unexpectedly romantic. Wesley Deeds (Tyler Perry) is a prominent businessman who has successfully taken the reins of the family business.

    <desc lang="en">Ubiquitous MTV emcee/vee-jay/interviewer Carson Daly came to "mainstream" TV as host of this nightly NBC half-hour chatfest, which aired just after Late Night With Conan O'Brien in the 12:35 a.m. time slot previously occupied by Later With Bob Costas. Taped on the network's Saturday Night Live set in New York, the series did its best to eschew the usual couch-and-desk talk show format; with no monologue and no sketches, Daly simply sat down and talked to his guests, who returned the compliment by avoiding the standard relentless plugging of their latest movie, CD, or TV special. Last Call With Carson Daly was supposed to premiere on Monday, January 7, 2002, but a last-minute contract dispute between MTV and NBC forced the latter network to sheepishly issue an apology and move the debut episode to Tuesday, January 8(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Ubiquitous MTV emcee/vee-jay/interviewer Carson Daly came to "mainstream" TV as host of this nightly NBC half-hour chatfest, which aired just after Late Night With Conan O'Brien in the 12:35 a.m. time slot previously occupied by Later With Bob Costas. Taped on the network's Saturday Night Live set in New York, the series did its best to eschew the usual couch-and-desk talk show format; with no monologue and no sketches, Daly simply sat down and talked to his guests, who returned the compliment by avoiding the standard relentless plugging of their latest movie, CD, or TV special. Last Call With Carson Daly was supposed to premiere on Monday, January 7, 2002, but a last-minute contract dispute between MTV and NBC forced the latter network to sheepishly issue an apology and move the debut episode to Tuesday, January 8(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">To Catch a Hippo</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">To Catch a Hippo. Strong, fast and semi-aquatic, the hippo is one of Africa's biggest wildlife management challenges.1 The use of tranquilizer darts is nearly impossible, as a threatened hippo will dart straight for the nearest body of water and dig in. If the animal has been tranquilized, it can drown before the drug wears off, hampering the efforts of wildlife specialists. 2 But Brady has a new idea-he wants to see if a net will hamper the hippo enough to keep it out of water and make the capture safer. First, he pays a visit to Florida to test his idea out on wily Florida swamp gators-and it's a complete success. He then packs up his nets and heads for Malawi, where he'll learn the ins and outs of the net gun already in use on smaller game. After an unexpectedly intense pursuit of a slippery warthog, the team is prepared to tackle the big game-the hippopotamus. With ground and air units in place, the search begins to find and safely capture a hippopotamus and see if Brady and his team can rewrite the rules of hippo capture!(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">What Are You Eating</title>
    <desc lang="en">Up until the 1950s, food was a relatively simple matter, with narrow choice and a constant battle to keep food fresh. Fast forward to the present day and mass production, intensive farming, refrigeration, freezing and food technology have provided more choice and lower prices. However, a sizeable proportion of food is now processed to maintain freshness, leading presenter Philip Boucher-Hayes to ask if people really know what they are eating. In the first edition, the presenter examines how the Irish consumer has changed over the years, and is joined by chef Hilary O'Hagan to look at processed meat products and the Paleo diet.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Tyler Perry's Meet the Browns</title>
    <desc lang="en">Prolific playwright Tyler Perry adapts his popular stage play of the same name in this family-oriented comedy concerning a desperate mother who connects with the family she never knew. Brenda is a single Chicago mother of three who has been struggling for years to keep her kids off of the streets. Suddenly let go from her job with no warning to speak of, the eternally optimistic mother begins to experience a suffocating sense of hopelessness for the very first time in her life. When Brenda receives a death notice claiming that the father she has never met has passed away, she quickly gathers up the kids and sets out for Georgia to attend the funeral. Upon arriving in the Deep South, the once fretful mother is pleasantly surprised to discover that there is a whole side of the family she never knew existed. A crass but good-natured clan that welcomes Brenda and her children with open arms, the Browns' lazy summer afternoons and frequent trips to the county fair offer a much-needed contrast to the stress of surviving in inner city Chicago. Writer/director/actor Perry reprises his role as indomitable, law-breaking grandmother Madea in a comedy that proves sometimes second chances come when you least expect it(n)</desc>

This historical and personal film tells the story of several Cuban exiles who left their island country from the port of Mariel during the boatlift of 1980. Following a rush on the embassy in Havana, more than 100,000 Cubans fled their homeland in hopes of creating a new life in the U.S. A mass of Cuban residents -- from average middle-class families to hardened criminals -- huddled onto boats. Upon their arrival in Florida, many of them were met with violence. Perez-Ray visits with many of the surviving exiles for in-depth interviews(n)</desc>

Convinced that he will capture video evidence of Sasquatch at the same place where the legendary Patterson-Gimlin film was shot, Jim (Bryce Johnson) persuades his skeptical girlfriend Kelly (Alexie Gilmore) to join him on a cryptozoological excursion into the deep woods. Before Jim and Kelly set out on their mission, however, they first visit Willow Creek -- a town that thrives on the Bigfoot phenomenon -- to interview the locals about the legend. There, the couple are repeatedly warned that the forest can be a dangerous place at night -- warnings that go unheeded by Jim as he single-mindedly focuses on making the journey he's dreamt about for years. Later, in the darkened woods, however, the once-carefree couple experience paralyzing fear when someone -- or something -- begins rooting around their campsite, and uttering inhuman howls. Uncertain if they've actually survived an encounter with Bigfoot or simply fallen victim to a cruel prank by the locals, Jim and Kelly agree to pack their bags, and return to civilization at sunrise.

    <title lang="en">Tyler Perry's Meet the Browns</title>
    <desc lang="en">Prolific playwright Tyler Perry adapts his popular stage play of the same name in this family-oriented comedy concerning a desperate mother who connects with the family she never knew. Brenda is a single Chicago mother of three who has been struggling for years to keep her kids off of the streets. Suddenly let go from her job with no warning to speak of, the eternally optimistic mother begins to experience a suffocating sense of hopelessness for the very first time in her life. When Brenda receives a death notice claiming that the father she has never met has passed away, she quickly gathers up the kids and sets out for Georgia to attend the funeral. Upon arriving in the Deep South, the once fretful mother is pleasantly surprised to discover that there is a whole side of the family she never knew existed. A crass but good-natured clan that welcomes Brenda and her children with open arms, the Browns' lazy summer afternoons and frequent trips to the county fair offer a much-needed contrast to the stress of surviving in inner city Chicago. Writer/director/actor Perry reprises his role as indomitable, law-breaking grandmother Madea in a comedy that proves sometimes second chances come when you least expect it(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In the aftermath of a job gone awry, an American hitman retreats to the Italian countryside, where he befriends a local priest and strikes up an unexpected romance while awaiting the details of his next assignment. Jack (George Clooney) is lucky to be alive after his Swedish assignment went sour, and he knows that it's only a matter of time before his luck runs out. Not eager to tempt fate again, Jack arrives in a small Italian town and takes a job assembling a weapon for the mysterious Mathilde (Thekla Reuten). During this uncharacteristically peaceful interlude, Jack befriends kindly clergyman Father Benedetto (Paolo Bonacelli), and connects with pretty local Clara (Violante Placido). But in the process of reaching out for a little human contact, Jack is making himself more vulnerable than ever. The American was adapted for the screen from the novel A Very Private Gentleman by author Martin Booth(n)</desc>

Primo (Tony Shalhoub) is the extremely gifted but difficult chef and his brother Secondo (Stanley Tucci) is the smooth front man who tries in vain to keep the restaurant afloat and to control his brother's temper. The restaurant is in dire trouble and the brothers are staring failure in the face when successful restaurant owner Pascal (Ian Holm) offers a solution. He owns a flashy Americanized Italian eatery which offers customers entertainment and mediocre food and suggests that he invite his 'friend', a big jazz musician, to play at the brothers' restaurant.

Primo (Tony Shalhoub) is the extremely gifted but difficult chef and his brother Secondo (Stanley Tucci) is the smooth front man who tries in vain to keep the restaurant afloat and to control his brother's temper. The restaurant is in dire trouble and the brothers are staring failure in the face when successful restaurant owner Pascal (Ian Holm) offers a solution. He owns a flashy Americanized Italian eatery which offers customers entertainment and mediocre food and suggests that he invite his 'friend', a big jazz musician, to play at the brothers' restaurant. Excited, the brothers set about preparing for the big night, inviting friends along for the event. Primo is planning a feast fit for a king with enough food to feed the whole of Italy! When the guests arrive, the food and drink begins to flow and the crowd enjoy a riotous night of dancing and singing as the brothers discover what really matters in life(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Two mismatched wolves embark on a cross-country quest to get back home and restore peace in their pack after being relocated thousands of miles away by well-meaning park rangers. Quick-witted Humphrey (voice of Justin Long) likes to frolic with friends and play video games with squirrels; disciplined Kate (voice of Hayden Panettiere) likes to call the shots and hunt caribou. Normally, an omega wolf like Humphrey would never stand a chance with an alpha wolf like Kate, but when they're both transported halfway across the country they must work together to get back to their natural habitat. And it won't be easy either, because the one thing Humphrey and Kate can agree on is that they don't have anything in common. Perhaps by working together toward a common goal, however, the two contentious traveling companions will finally realize that even lone wolves can use a helping paw every once in a while. Christina Ricci, Danny Glover, Dennis Hopper, and Larry Miller also supply voices for the Crest Animation production, helmed by Anthony Bell and Ben Gluck from a script by Chris Denk(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Trumpet of the Swan</title>
    <desc lang="en">E.B. White's children's story of a swan searching for his voice comes to life in this animated adventure. When young Louie the Swan is hatched, it's soon discovered that he isn't able to make a sound, which is a matter of no small annoyance to his boastful father (voice of Jason Alexander) and doting mother (voice of Mary Steenburgen). As Louie gets a bit older, he falls in love with Serena (voice of Reese Witherspoon), but he has no way of telling her how he feels. Despondent, Louie flies away, and makes friends with a young boy named Sam (voice of Sam Gifaldi). Sam realizes Louie has a problem, and with the help of his schoolteacher, Mrs. Hammerbotham (Carol Burnett), Louie learns to read and write. Louie is thrilled that he has finally found a way to communicate, but his joy is short-lived when he discovers his fellow swans are not well acquainted with the English language. At long last, Louie finds a way to speak in a way his family and fellows can understand when his father gives him a trumpet; while Louie is thrilled and shows a remarkable gift for the instrument, his dad's happiness is diluted by the fact that the horn is stolen merchandise. Determined to pay for the stolen trumpet and make his family proud, Louie flies away to the big city, where he lands a lucrative gig playing with a jazz combo. At last, Louie has found fame, fortune, and self-respect, but can he win the heart of Serena away from her fiancé, Boyd (Seth Green)? The score for The Trumpet of the Swan was written by noted jazz artist Marcus Miller; rock &amp; roll pioneer Little Richard also contributed a song to the soundtrack(n)</desc>

When young Louie the Swan is hatched, it's soon discovered that he isn't able to make a sound, which is a matter of no small annoyance to his boastful father (voice of Jason Alexander) and doting mother (voice of Mary Steenburgen). As Louie gets a bit older, he falls in love with Serena (voice of Reese Witherspoon), but he has no way of telling her how he feels. Despondent, Louie flies away, and makes friends with a young boy named Sam (voice of Sam Gifaldi). Sam realizes Louie has a problem, and with the help of his schoolteacher, Mrs. Hammerbotham (Carol Burnett), Louie learns to read and write. Louie is thrilled that he has finally found a way to communicate, but his joy is short-lived when he discovers his fellow swans are not well acquainted with the English language.

    <title lang="en">The Perfect Holiday</title>
    <desc lang="en">Gabrielle Union, Morris Chestnut, Queen Latifah, and Terrence Howard star in a film concerning a young girl who implores a department-store Santa to find a new husband for her divorced mother for Christmas. Single mother of three Nancy (Union) has been putting the needs of her three children ahead of her own for as far back as she can remember, and lately her youngest daughter, Emily (Khail Bryant), has become acutely aware of her mother's palpable sadness. As Christmas draws near, Nancy takes her kids to the mall for a cheerful visit with jolly old Saint Nick. When it comes time for Emily's turn to sit on Santa's lap and make her Christmas wish, she selflessly remembers her mother's recent comment that a compliment from a man would be the best gift of all. Determined to make her mother happy again even if it means sacrificing her own wish, Emily relays the message to Santa (Chestnut), not realizing that the man beneath the beard is actually an office-supply salesman and ambitious singer/songwriter named Benjamin. Recognizing the daughter's love for her mother and sensing something truly special in Nancy, Benjamin cheerfully obliges the young girl, setting into motion a series of events that promise to make this the most memorable holiday in quite some time.

Barney Martin and Liz Sheridan guest star as Jerry's parents. Viewers may wish to note that this is the only episode in the show's history to not feature an appearance by Jason Alexander's character, George Costanza. In addition, only this and "The Chinese Restaurant" are void of Michael Richards' Cosmo Kramer.
