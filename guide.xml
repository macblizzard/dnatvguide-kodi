Russell Crowe stars as Captain Jack Aubrey, a high-seas adventurer who maintains a strong bond with ship-surgeon Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany). After conquering much of Europe already, Napoleon's forces have set their sights on taking Britain, so Aubrey and the crew of his ship, the HMS Surprise, take to the Pacific to intercept any attacking ships from the French fleet. When Aubrey eyes a renegade French super-frigate, the Surprise pursues, leading to an adrenaline-charged chase through the distant reaches of the sea. Edward Woodall, James D'Arcy, and Lee Ingleby also star as members of the Surprise's crew(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Endlessly imitated, The Terminator made the reputation of cowriter/director James Cameron -- who would go on to make 1997's titanic Titanic -- and solidified the stardom of Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), a member of the human resistance movement, is teleported back to 1984. His purpose: to rescue Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), the mother of the man who will lead the 21st-century rebels against the tyrannical machines, from being assassinated before she can give birth. Likewise thrust back to 1984 is The Terminator (Schwarzenegger), a grim, well-armed, virtually indestructable cyborg who has been programmed to eliminate Sarah Connor. After killing two "Sarah Connors" who turn out to be the wrong women, he finally aims his gunsights at the genuine article. This is the film in which Schwarzenegger declared "I'll be baaaack" -- and back he was, in "kinder and gentler" form, in the even more successful Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)(n)</desc>

Adapted from the off-Broadway play by Tracy Letts, Bug centers on Agnes (Ashley Judd), who tends bar alongside pal R.C. (Lynn Collins), and has recently moved into a shoddy roadside motel in hopes of avoiding her menacing and recently paroled ex-husband, Jerry (Harry Connick Jr.). Upon making the acquaintance of subdued former soldier Peter (Michael Shannon, repeating his stage role), a veteran of the first Gulf War, Agnes finally senses that things are looking up. Quietly charming despite his melancholy aura, Peter soon reveals to Agnes that he contracted a "bug" while serving in the Middle East, and that it may have been deliberately administered as part of a secret military medical experiment. Convinced that the microscopic insects are quickly multiplying just under the surface of his skin and that they have now infected Agnes as well, Peter soon descends into a psychotic rage as he resorts to increasingly desperate measures to purge himself of the offending subdermal arthropods(n)</desc>

Pretending to be a dog, Curly is delivered to the insurance doctor on a leash, but the good doc insists on performing a cerebrum decapitation on his patient and the Stooges flee on a runaway gurney. One of the busiest starlets in the Stooges stock company, Dorothy Appleby, headed the supporting cast which also included black comic Dudley Dickerson, former boxer Cy Schindell, the formidable-looking Blanche Payson and sour-faced Ned Glass (in his second of two early Stooges appearances). The latter became one of the victims of the insidious Hollywood "red scare" blacklist, but his friendship with Moe Howard led to work in such Stooge comedies as Hokus Pokus (1949) and Three Hams on Rye (1954)(n)</desc>

Wheelsy is a small rural town where not much happens, but that's about to change, and not for the better. Grant Grant (Michael Rooker), the town's wealthiest and most powerful citizen, is taking a walk through the woods when he comes across a strange and unfamiliar life form. Grant makes the mistake of getting too close to it, and soon an otherworldly creature has taken over his body. It isn't long before Grant isn't the only one who has been attacked by the strange and slimy things, as a local girl and a handful of house pets go missing. Grant's wife, Starla (Elizabeth Banks), notices that something is very wrong with her husband around the same time that Sheriff Bill Pardy (Nathan Fillion) becomes aware of the pattern of missing people and animals, and they set out to put a stop to the alien invaders intent upon taking over Wheelsy.

    <desc lang="en">Following the life of cocaine-trafficking pioneer George Jung in a way that recalls Martin Scorsese's Casino, Blow recounts the man's days from his 1950s childhood in Boston to his downfall in the 1980s. George (played by Johnny Depp) begins his life as the son of Fred (Ray Liotta), an earnest breadwinner, and Ermine (Rachel Griffiths), who frequently walks out on them in pursuit of a more fulfilling life. When George moves west to California in the late '60s, accompanied by best pal Tuna (Ethan Suplee), he becomes an entrepreneur in the marijuana business, which soon spreads to the East Coast as well, with girlfriend Barbara (Franka Potente) smuggling the product during her stewardess shifts. George is arrested in 1972 -- at which time Barbara dies of cancer -- but George finds a new ally in Diego (Jordi Molla), who proposes the idea that he become the American conduit for Colombian kingpin Pablo Escobar (Cliff Curtis). George flourishes in the heyday of the disco era, and falls for Mirtha (Penelope Cruz), a self-serving bombshell who eventually has a daughter with him. Trouble escalates as the FBI threatens to bring George and his crew down, while he desperately tries to be a stable parent to his young offspring. Blow also features Paul Reubens and Max Perlich in featured roles(n)</desc>

This is demonstrated by the emperor tamarin males conned into childcare in Peru and the South African vervet monkeys that have a sophisticated alarm system to protect them from predators. But living together often has its problems, like the Barbary macaques in Gibraltar who have their babies stolen by others out to impress their boss, the matriarchal ring-tailed lemur societies where females battle one another with their children in tow, and the hamadryas baboons of Ethiopia where the males rule with an iron fist.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Gold.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Art historian James Fox follows up his British Masters series by investigating artists' use of blue, white and gold, and explains how, by choosing these colours, painters have stirred emotions, changed the way people behave and had an impact on the course of history. He begins with gold and its use in early sun worship, before reinterpreting the treasures of the pharaohs, the mosaics of Byzantium and the work of Renaissance master Benvenuto Cellini. He also explores Gustav Klimt's The Kiss and discovers a Birmingham inventor who tried to achieve the alchemist's dream - turning base metals into gold.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Actor-turned-director and producer Griffin Dunne (Practical Magic, Addicted to Love) teams up with scenarist Dirk Wittenborn for the slice-of-life ensemble drama Fierce People. As summer encroaches, 16-year-old Manhattanite Finn Earl (Anton Yelchin) would love nothing more than to trek off to South America and spend the year's sun-drenched months near the equator, embarking on thrilling adventures with his estranged archaeologist father, whom he's never met. Alas, the bonds of family rein in tight when Finn's booze- and coke-addled mother, the masseuse Liz (Diane Lane), cries out for help -- and, in the process, unwittingly gets Finn arrested. In a dramatic attempt to reverse circumstances and sort out the complications in both of their lives, Liz insists on taking custody of Finn for the summer. Both, she insists, will live in the home of one of her former massage clients, the aging billionaire Ogden C. Osborne (Donald Sutherland) -- with whom she may be amorously involved. Though Finn agrees begrudgingly at first, in time he finds the environment welcoming -- as he develops a crush on Ogden's gorgeous granddaughter (Kristen Stewart) and befriends Ogden's grandson. But when an unforeseen and shocking act of violence erupts, it estranges Finn and Liz from their posh surroundings and provides a sobering, harrowing reminder of the socioeconomic differences between the Earls and their new friends(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">(2010) Michael Cera (Juno, Superbad) stars in this unconventionally structured, inventive and comic paean to the alternate universe of manga and computer gaming. The movie is based on an acclaimed series of graphic novels by Canadian cartoonist Bryan Lee O'Malley, and is directed by British film-maker Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Channel 4's TV series Spaced), here making his Hollywood debut. Computer game fanatic Scott Pilgrim (Cera) is the bass player with Toronto band Sex Bob-omb. He shares his flat with his slightly-out-of-control gay friend Wallace Wells (Kieran Culkin), and courts a little controversy by dating 17-year-old schoolgirl Knives Chau (Ellen Wong). However, theirs is a fairly platonic relationship, and one he's prepared to ditch the moment he sets eyes on the woman (literally) of his dreams: Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). But if Scott wants to capture the impossibly cool New Yorker's heart, he must first defeat her former lovers, the Seven Evil Exes, in video game end-level-style combat. So he embarks on a kinetic, romantic quest, largely conducted within his own head, replete with slapstick violence, impressive effects and witty retorts(n)</desc>

Martin Lawrence and Steve Zahn star, respectively, as Earl Montgomery, a loudmouthed police academy reject, and Hank Rafferty, a mild-mannered cop who is disgraced and dismissed from his job. Having met once before on a traffic stop, the two men are less than thrilled to be paired together as security guards. When the two men discover a complex smuggling scheme, however, they put aside their animosity to investigate the criminal scheme. They soon learn that the illegal enterprise involves a mastermind named Nash (Eric Roberts) and a new, virtually indestructible metal that's worth a fortune. Unable to persuade Hank's former police department superiors that they're onto a huge case, the two partners must devise a way to expose the sophisticated scam and bring down Nash on their own. National Security co-stars Colm Feore, Bill Duke, Timothy Busfield, and Wayne Knight(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Respect - Part Two.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Conclusion of the two-part series finale, bringing to an end Britain's longest-running police procedural drama, which has been broadcast in 55 countries. The show, which began life as one-off drama Woodentop in 1984, broke new ground by exploring the lives and loves of the officers of the fictional London station of Sun Hill. Callum finally proves himself to Smithy as they hunt the members of the Parkway Crew responsible for the death of Liam Martin, and Mickey goes all-out to get justice for his informant Jasmine Harris following the gang rape.(n)</desc>

At the end of the show, Kellerman would award points for the most cogent opinions and arguments, and also subtract points from contributors whom he determined had not effectively expressed themselves.

    <title lang="en">Around the Horn</title>
    <desc lang="en">Hosted--or rather, refereed--by boxing expert Max Kellerman, this lively cable-TV discussion show featured four sports columnists, each from a different part of the USA, discussing recent pro-athletic developments in a sort of electronic summit meeting. Kellerman determined how much time each of the columnists would be permitted to express his or her opinions--and he was harsh indeed, frequently limiting the discourse to ten seconds or less. At the end of the show, Kellerman would award points for the most cogent opinions and arguments, and also subtract points from contributors whom he determined had not effectively expressed themselves. The inagural episode of ESPN's Around the Horn was seen on September 30, 2002(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A woman realizes that friends can be lovers, but now has to convince the friend in question in this romantic comedy. Michael O'Neal (Dermot Mulroney) and Julianne Potter (Julia Roberts) were romantically involved in college, and after breaking up, they have managed to remain close friends. For years, Julianne and Michael have had a pledge that if both were single when they turned 28, they would get married. Shortly before her 28th birthday, Julianne is lamenting the sad state of her love life when she gets a call from Michael, who announces that he has important news. Julianne is convinced that Michael is going to ask her to marry him, and she is crestfallen when he announces that he's engaged to Kimmy Wallace (Cameron Diaz). Kimmy seems like the perfect woman for Michael; she's sweet, pretty, bright, and adores Michael, and her wealthy family is just as fond of him as she is. But now that Julianne has realized how much she loves Michael, she's not about to give him up without a fight -- and isn't afraid to fight dirty. Julianne's uneasy ally in the battle for Michael's affections is her friend and editor George Downes (Rupert Everett), a cheerfully out-of-the-closet homosexual who is not prepared when Julianne asks him to pose as her boyfriend(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Beware of what goes "bump" (and "squeak" and "flap flap flap") in the night. Dr. Sheila Casper (Dina Meyer) is a respected zoologist dispatched by the government to Gallup, TX, a small community suffering from an unusual number of reported bat attacks. Casper finds this news puzzling, since bats are generally placid creatures who avoid contact with humans. The local sheriff, Emmett Kimsey (Lou Diamond Phillips), assures Casper that the reports are on the level and that something needs to be done about swarms of aggressive bats so thick they blot out the moon. Caspar and Kimsey discover that a new breed of genetically altered bats have escaped from a research facility and taken up residence in a cave near Gallup -- but the nocturnal bloodsuckers have no intention of leaving as quickly as they arrived. Bats was written by John Logan, who had two other projects hit the screen within a few months of Bats' release: Oliver Stone's Any Given Sunday and Ridley Scott's Gladiator. The supporting cast includes Leon and Bob Gunton(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Kung Fu Hustle</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Stephen Chow made his name in this country with the deliriously wonderful Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle continues his love of comedy kung-fu films. Set in pre-revolutionary China, Chow plays Sing, a street hustler who makes the mistake of pretending to be a member of the notorious Axe gang. He becomes caught up in a war between the gang and the residents of Pig Sty Alley, which the gang want to take over. Little do they know that two of the Alley's residents are retired martial arts experts and soon the fists and feet are flying in knockabout fights that owe as much to Kill Bill (some of the wire work is done by Yuen Wo Ping, who worked on Tarantino's film) as they do to classic Hollywood silent comedies. Film fans can enjoy Chow's references to films ranging from Top Hat to The Shining while the rest can just enjoy a wildly entertaining romp. In Cantonese with English subtitles(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Bats</title>
    <desc lang="en">Beware of what goes "bump" (and "squeak" and "flap flap flap") in the night. Dr. Sheila Casper (Dina Meyer) is a respected zoologist dispatched by the government to Gallup, TX, a small community suffering from an unusual number of reported bat attacks. Casper finds this news puzzling, since bats are generally placid creatures who avoid contact with humans. The local sheriff, Emmett Kimsey (Lou Diamond Phillips), assures Casper that the reports are on the level and that something needs to be done about swarms of aggressive bats so thick they blot out the moon. Caspar and Kimsey discover that a new breed of genetically altered bats have escaped from a research facility and taken up residence in a cave near Gallup -- but the nocturnal bloodsuckers have no intention of leaving as quickly as they arrived. Bats was written by John Logan, who had two other projects hit the screen within a few months of Bats' release: Oliver Stone's Any Given Sunday and Ridley Scott's Gladiator. The supporting cast includes Leon and Bob Gunton(n)</desc>

Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright) makes the mistake of trying to protect a batch of cupcakes Lisa (voice of Yeardley Smith) made for her teacher from schoolyard bully and thug in training Nelson (voice of Cartwright). Nelson gives Bart a beating, and promises more of the same; Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) suggests that Bart try to reason with the bully, while Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) tells his son that fighting dirty is the only answer. Neither strategy seems to work, so Bart turns to Grampa Simpson (voice of Castellaneta) for advice. With the help of Herman (voice of Harry Shearer), the mildly insane owner of a store specializing in military relics, Bart and Grampa organize his fellow fourth graders into an army and orchestrate an all-out water-balloon war against Nelson and his fellow bullies. "Bart the General" was first aired on February 4, 1990(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In the last programme of knockout week, the second group of five chefs face two tough tests. First they work together to cook a three-course fine dining lunch for ex-England captain Mike Gatting and his guests at Lord's cricket ground. They have to build their menu around mackerel, rabbit, apples and pears - and teamwork will be key as they to plan, execute and transport their dishes to the table. They then return to the MasterChef kitchen to produce a showstopper dish in just 90 minutes - hoping it will be enough to book their place in the semi-finals. As ever, deciding their fates will be no-nonsense judges Marcus Wareing and Monica Galetti.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Kevin Bacon, Marcia Gay Harden, and Miles Heizer star in director Alison Eastwood's tale of two families locked into an emotional -- and physical -- collision course. There once was a time when Tom and Megan Stark had all the time in the world to take their dream vacation and start a family, but these days the couple's marriage is suffering and their time appears to be running short. Megan has been diagnosed with a potentially terminal illness, and when the prospect of losing his wife becomes too much to bear, railroad engineer Tom seeks escape in his work. On the tracks Tom is in control; all the routes are predetermined and he knows he'll eventually arrive at his destination. But sometimes even the most predictable events can go suddenly awry, and when Tom's train hits a car that was parked on the tracks by a suicidal mother, his life is plunged into ruin. While there was no way that Tom could have possibly stopped the train on time, the grieving conductor's woes are suddenly compounded upon realizing that he may lose his job because of the accident. Not only that, but the deceased woman's son, Davey, is consumed by the guilt that he could do nothing to prevent the accident, and he now places the blame for his mother's death squarely on Tom. But not all sad stories have to end in tragedy, and perhaps in the aftermath of this fateful accident Megan could receive a second chance at fulfilling her dreams, Tom could learn to open his heart before he is consumed by bitterness, and Davey could finally learn the true meaning of family(n)</desc>

There once was a time when Tom and Megan Stark had all the time in the world to take their dream vacation and start a family, but these days the couple's marriage is suffering and their time appears to be running short. Megan has been diagnosed with a potentially terminal illness, and when the prospect of losing his wife becomes too much to bear, railroad engineer Tom seeks escape in his work. On the tracks Tom is in control; all the routes are predetermined and he knows he'll eventually arrive at his destination. But sometimes even the most predictable events can go suddenly awry, and when Tom's train hits a car that was parked on the tracks by a suicidal mother, his life is plunged into ruin. While there was no way that Tom could have possibly stopped the train on time, the grieving conductor's woes are suddenly compounded upon realizing that he may lose his job because of the accident. Not only that, but the deceased woman's son, Davey, is consumed by the guilt that he could do nothing to prevent the accident, and he now places the blame for his mother's death squarely on Tom. But not all sad stories have to end in tragedy, and perhaps in the aftermath of this fateful accident Megan could receive a second chance at fulfilling her dreams, Tom could learn to open his heart before he is consumed by bitterness, and Davey could finally learn the true meaning of family(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Selena</title>
    <desc lang="en">Selena was a 23-year old Tejana singer on the verge of an international breakthrough when she was shot by the president of her own fan club. Her death spawned an outpouring of grief not seen since the death of Elvis Presley. This upbeat and tuneful biopic, executive produced by her father, Abraham Quintanilla (portrayed in the film by Edward James Olmos), is a celebration of his daughter's life, chronicling her rise to fame. The film opens with Selena (Jennifer Lopez) performing at the Houston Astrodome before a sold-out audience. The story moves backwards and begins not with Selena, but with Abraham who in the early '60s had an unsuccessful doo-wop group in Texas. As a child, Selena (Rebecca Lee Meza) showed an exceptional talent for singing. Abraham exploited that and the talents of his other two children to form a band. Much of the film focuses on the fact that Selena, though born in Texas in a Mexican-American community, had to learn Spanish as a second language. Her father insisted that she sing in the language, but it was not easy for her. To maintain the story's celebratory air, it only lightly touches on Selena's relationship with her killer -- the actual shooting occurs off-screen. The after-effects of Selena's death are also only briefly presented(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Conjuring</title>
    <desc lang="en">A demonic entity lays claim to family living in a secluded farmhouse, prompting them to seek the aid of two renowned paranormal researchers in this tale of possession inspired by actual events. The story gets underway as paranormal researchers Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) evaluate a mysterious doll discovered by a trio of young roommates in 1968. Believing their house to be haunted by the wayward spirit of a deceased young girl, they give the girl permission to inhabit the doll, and soon their lives become a waking nightmare. Informed by Ed and Lorraine that they have fallen victim to an inhuman spirit (aka a demon) seeking a human host, the roommates entrust the doll to the Warrens, who place it in their personal museum for safekeeping. Flash forward three years to Harrisville, RI, where the Perron family have just moved into their country dream home -- an 18th century farmhouse that offers plenty of space for parents Carolyn (Lili Taylor) and Roger (Ron Livingston), as well as their five daughters Andrea (Shanley Caswell), Nancy (Hayley McFarland), Christine (Joey King), Cindy (Mackenzie Foy), and April (Kyla Deaver). It seems like the ideal place to raise a family until a series of unsettling events leave the Perron family convinced they are not alone. Terrified, Carolyn reaches out to the Warrens for help, and learns that a demonic entity has attached itself to her family, and has no intentions of letting them go. Meanwhile, the deeper the Warrens delve into the farmhouse's history, the clearer it becomes that this spirit has a murderous agenda, and that no one will be safe until it is driven back into darkness(n)</desc>

It is 1985 and Richard Nixon continues his tenure in the White House, massively popular with the electorate following his crushing defeat of the Viet Cong. However, it seems that the American public have fallen out of love with their superheroes, one of whom, Dr Manhattan, was largely responsible for the winning the Vietnam War. Now, he and his fellow crime-fighters are regarded as reprehensible vigilantes and have been banned by law. But, when one of their number - the vile, ironically named Comedian - is murdered, the former heroes begin to re-emerge from the shadows to investigate. They discover that a terrifying plan is afoot... Also starring Matthew Goode, Malin Akerman, Patrick Wilson and Jackie Earle Haley(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Selena</title>
    <desc lang="en">Selena was a 23-year old Tejana singer on the verge of an international breakthrough when she was shot by the president of her own fan club. Her death spawned an outpouring of grief not seen since the death of Elvis Presley. This upbeat and tuneful biopic, executive produced by her father, Abraham Quintanilla (portrayed in the film by Edward James Olmos), is a celebration of his daughter's life, chronicling her rise to fame. The film opens with Selena (Jennifer Lopez) performing at the Houston Astrodome before a sold-out audience. The story moves backwards and begins not with Selena, but with Abraham who in the early '60s had an unsuccessful doo-wop group in Texas. As a child, Selena (Rebecca Lee Meza) showed an exceptional talent for singing. Abraham exploited that and the talents of his other two children to form a band. Much of the film focuses on the fact that Selena, though born in Texas in a Mexican-American community, had to learn Spanish as a second language. Her father insisted that she sing in the language, but it was not easy for her. To maintain the story's celebratory air, it only lightly touches on Selena's relationship with her killer -- the actual shooting occurs off-screen. The after-effects of Selena's death are also only briefly presented(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Conjuring</title>
    <desc lang="en">A demonic entity lays claim to family living in a secluded farmhouse, prompting them to seek the aid of two renowned paranormal researchers in this tale of possession inspired by actual events. The story gets underway as paranormal researchers Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) evaluate a mysterious doll discovered by a trio of young roommates in 1968. Believing their house to be haunted by the wayward spirit of a deceased young girl, they give the girl permission to inhabit the doll, and soon their lives become a waking nightmare. Informed by Ed and Lorraine that they have fallen victim to an inhuman spirit (aka a demon) seeking a human host, the roommates entrust the doll to the Warrens, who place it in their personal museum for safekeeping. Flash forward three years to Harrisville, RI, where the Perron family have just moved into their country dream home -- an 18th century farmhouse that offers plenty of space for parents Carolyn (Lili Taylor) and Roger (Ron Livingston), as well as their five daughters Andrea (Shanley Caswell), Nancy (Hayley McFarland), Christine (Joey King), Cindy (Mackenzie Foy), and April (Kyla Deaver). It seems like the ideal place to raise a family until a series of unsettling events leave the Perron family convinced they are not alone. Terrified, Carolyn reaches out to the Warrens for help, and learns that a demonic entity has attached itself to her family, and has no intentions of letting them go. Meanwhile, the deeper the Warrens delve into the farmhouse's history, the clearer it becomes that this spirit has a murderous agenda, and that no one will be safe until it is driven back into darkness(n)</desc>

Recognizing the possibility for profit, the scheming duo plans to sell the cocaine to Brody's drug-dealing cousin (Omari Hardwick). Meanwhile Jesus (Cisco Reyes) and his girlfriend Chita (Yasmin Deliz), the intended recipients of the cocaine, set out to procure the package before notorious drug lord Bodego Diablo (Emilio Rivera) realizes it's gone missing. But Bodega is no slouch; he already knows the shipment was botched, and he's determined to get his drugs back no matter what the cost.

When elderly Mrs. Xiao (Lisa Lu) dies in her sleep at home, her housekeeper and close friend Viola (Talia Shire) contacts her four adult children in hopes they'll come home to help with the funeral. Unfortunately, Mrs. Xiao didn't have many friends besides Viola, her children all have issues with her, and given her zeal to assimilate into American culture, the siblings are more than puzzled that she insisted upon a traditional Chinese funeral lasting a full seven days. Alexander (Russell Wong), a successful doctor, is still coming to terms with his overly strict mother and philandering father, and is unexpectedly reunited with his ex-wife (Kelly Hu), who he lost through his own infidelity. Elizabeth (Julia Nickson), a writer, also crosses paths with her former spouse (Adrian Hough) while she mourns both her mother and her young son. Victoria (Francoise Yip) has never been able to forgive her mom after she rejected her for marrying an African-American. And MeiMei (Steph Song), an actress, is a lesbian who wants to have children with her significant other Deedee (Bai Ling); they've been having trouble finding a suitable sperm donor, though they think one of the monks at the funeral may be just what they're looking for.

Revisiting the "Americans in France" theme that Ivory explored in 1998's A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries, the film stars Kate Hudson as Isabel Walker. When she receives word that her pregnant poetess sister Roxy (Naomi Watts) has been left by her philandering French husband, artist Charles-Henri de Persand (Melvil Poupaud), Isabel offers her help and moral support. As the depressive Roxy struggles with the separation proceedings -- which include the rights to ownership of a work of art that's a family heirloom -- Isabel takes a job with author Olivia Pace and has a fling with the bohemian Yves (Romain Duris). But things get complicated when the younger, more impudent sister decides instead to pursue Charles' uncle, the snooty, married diplomat Edgar (Thierry Lhermitte), and when a mysterious man (Matthew Modine) starts stalking Roxy. Eventually, the rest of the plucky Walker clan has to come to the aid of the siblings. Stockard Channing and Sam Waterston co-star(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Parenthood</title>
    <desc lang="en">This feel-good ensemble comedy tracks a quartet of suburban siblings and their families over the course of a single summer. Hardworking Gil Buckman (Steve Martin) and his stay-at-home wife, Karen (Mary Steeenburgen), have just a few months to help their oldest son, Kevin (Jasen Fisher), overcome his high-strung behavior problems before he'll be relegated to special-education classes. Gil's difficult relationship with his own father, Frank (Jason Robards), has led him to become a would-be super-dad for his three kids, so he takes his son's difficulties more than a little personally. Gil's sister, Helen (Dianne Wiest), is trying to raise a moody, adolescent son (Leaf Phoenix) and an independent-minded daughter (Martha Plimpton) with no help from her well-off ex-husband, who's more interested in his new wife and family. Gil and Helen's sister, Susan (Harley Jane Kozak), meanwhile, must participate in the too-scripted Big Life Plans of her anal-retentive husband, Nathan (Rick Moranis), whose overachiever zeal infects even their toddler daughter. When long-lost brother Larry (Tom Hulce) show up with yet another get-rich-quick scheme, he brings with him a surprise addition to the family. Screenwriters Babaloo Mandel, Lowell Ganz, and Ron Howard negotiate their varied subplots with a deftness and comedic touch that transforms this conflicted clan into a suburban everyfamily(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Adam Shankman's adaptation of the 2002 musical (itself an adaptation of John Waters' 1988 original movie) stars John Travolta, Queen Latifah and Nikki Blonsky. Teen Tracy Turnblad's regular cultural highlight is a local television music-and-dance programme called The Corny Collins Show. And, like all her friends, she dreams of having a chance to appear on it.

    <title lang="en">Disney's The Kid</title>
    <desc lang="en">If you could talk to the child that you used to be, what advice would you give him? That question forms the basis of this comic fantasy. Forty-year-old Russ Duritz (Bruce Willis) is a wealthy and powerful "image consultant" who has made a career out of telling people how to present themselves. But while he's a success in business, he's a failure in life; he's vain, mean-spirited, and hasn't been able to hold onto a marriage (or even a pet dog). One day, Russ is startled to meet Rusty (Spencer Breslin), a stocky kid whom he soon realizes is himself at the age of eight, having passed through a wrinkle in time. Young Rusty doesn't seem much happier than the grown-up Russ, so the older man takes his younger self under his wing and tries to teach him how to avoid the mistakes he's made, while Rusty encourages Russ to be a more caring human being. Along the way, Russ and Rusty become friends, and realize how much they can learn from each other. Disney's The Kid also stars Jean Smart as one of Russ' clients, Lily Tomlin as his assistant, and Daniel Von Bargen as his father(n)</desc>

When Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio), a multiple murderer who methodically drowns his victims and performs bizarre rituals with their bodies, falls into a coma, FBI agent Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) asks Deane to enter the killer's psyche, in the hope of finding a missing girl whom Stargher has kidnapped; if she's not soon found, in all likelihood she'll die in his torture cell. However, once Deane enters the bizarre world of Stargher's mind, she finds getting out to be a very difficult matter. The Cell was the first feature from director Tarsem, who previously made award-winning commercials and music videos, including the video for R.E.M.'s "Losing My Religion."

    <title lang="en">The Happening</title>
    <desc lang="en">Lady in the Water director M. Night Shyamalan puts PG-13 suspense on pause to tell this grim apocalyptic tale about a family fleeing a natural disaster that poses a grave threat to the whole of humanity. Philadelphia high-school science teacher Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) is discussing the disappearance of the bees with his students when the staff is summoned to the theater and briefed about a mysterious event that is currently unfolding in New York City. According to reports, citizens in the vicinity of Central Park have suddenly and inexplicably begun seizing up just before killing themselves by whatever means are at their disposal. As the phenomena begins to spread and talk of terrorism fills the airwaves, Elliot, his wife, Alma (Zooey Deschanel), their friend Julian (John Leguizamo), and his daughter, Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez), board a train bound for the presumed safety of the country. When the train screeches to a halt before arriving at its final destination, however, the frightened passengers are forced to fend for themselves as each consecutive news report paints an increasingly grim picture of the situation in more urbanized areas. Theories abound on what could be causing the unexplainable rash of suicides, but the only thing that everyone seems to agree on is that it's some kind of airborne contagion that is carried in the wind. It would appear that humankind's reign on planet Earth has come to an end, but perhaps if this small band of survivors can find a safe place to lie low until this all blows over, all hope for survival of the species might not be lost just yet(n)</desc>

Rifat lives in a modest, suburban Houston home next to racist reservist Mr. Vuoso (Aaron Eckhart) and meddling expectant mother Melina (Toni Collette). Adjusting to life in the suburbs isn't easy for young Jasira, though she tries her hardest to adapt to the unfamiliar environment by striking up casual conversations with her curious new neighbors. In the process, Jasira finds herself increasingly attracted to hormone-driven African-American teen Thomas (Eugene Jones). When Rifat finds out that his daughter's new boyfriend is black, he vehemently condemns the relationship. As America launches its initial invasion of Iraq, Jasira finds herself caught up in a potentially explosive situation that is only compounded by her raging hormones and the snooping of her pregnant, busybody neighbor(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Blair Witch Project</title>
    <desc lang="en">Combining Hi-8 video with black-and-white 16 mm film, this film presents a raw look at what can happen when college students forego common sense and enter the world of voodoo and witchcraft. Presented as a straightforward documentary, the film opens with a title card explaining that in 1994, three students went into the Maryland back woods to do a film project on the Blair Witch incidents. These kids were never seen again, and the film you are about to see is from their recovered equipment, found in the woods a year later. The entire movie documents their adventures leading up to their final minutes. The Blair Witch incident, as we initially learn from the local town elders, is an old legend about a group of witches who tortured and killed several children many years ago. Everyone in town knows the story and they're all sketchy on the details. Out in the woods and away from their parked car (and civilization), what starts as a school exercise turns into a nightmare when the three kids lose their map. Forced to spend extra days finding their way out, the kids then start to hear horrific sounds outside their tents in the pitch-black middle of night. They also find strange artifacts from (what can only be) the Blair Witch, still living in the woods. Frightened, they desperately try to find their way out of the woods, with no luck. Slowly these students start to unravel, knowing they have no way of getting out, no food, and it's getting cold. Each night they are confronted with shrieking and sounds so haunting that they are convinced someone is following them, and they quickly begin to fear for their lives. The film premiered in the midnight movie section at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Cruel Intentions</title>
    <desc lang="en">A loose adaptation of Choderlos De Laclos' 1782 novel Les Liaissons Dangereuses (which has been filmed three times before), Cruel Intentions revamps the story by moving it to the United States in the late 1990's and revising the context from royal romantic intrigue to teenage trechery among the filthy rich. Sarah Michelle Geller plays Kathryn, a beautiful but cold-hearted and manipulative young woman who enjoys making wagers with her jaded step-brother Sebastian (Ryan Phillippe). When Kathryn's boyfriend breaks off with her because he's infatuated with the less worldly Cecile (Selma Blair), Kathryn challenges Sebastian to seduce Cecile in order to ruin her new love. Sebastian reluctantly agrees, but is far more intrigued with a newer challenge -- Annette (Reese Witherspoon), the daughter of his private school's headmaster, who is intelligent, beautiful and has appeared in "Seventeen" magazine proudly announcing she intends to remain a virgin until the day she's married. Katheryn and Sebastian make a new bet: if he can bed Annette before the end of summer vacation, Katheryn will spend a debauched evening with him, but if he fails, she'll take ownership of his prized 1956 Jaguar. Supporting cast includes Swoozie Kurtz, who has gone this route before, having appeared in Stephen Frears' period adaptation of this story, Dangerous Liasons(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The architect visits a futuristic home designed to save space, with a double bed rising into the ceiling to reveal the living area beneath, and the kitchen and bathroom cleverly hidden from view.

He also meets a couple who are building the ultimate wilderness beach hut.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Lift Off. This landmark new series takes viewers back in time to see how the '80s created our modern world. The first episode of this six-part miniseries explores the revolution in personal entertainment brought on by Pac-Man, Sony Walkmans and Jane Fonda's ground-breaking workout video. Apple's Steve Wozniak helps explain how Bill Gates saw the future by selling IBM the rights to use MS-DOS software for a relatively small one-time fee, only to clean up when IBM competitors entered the market and all wanted the same software. The assassination of John Lennon heralded the end of one music era, while a bratty new kid on the block defined a new one - spelt 'MTV'. Revel in the joy of July 1981 in Britain as more than half a million people line the streets of London - and another 750 million tune-in around the globe - to see Prince Charles wed Lady Diana Spencer. And, hear from maverick businessman turned multimedia mogul Richard Branson on how he took Rock 'N Roll to new heights - literally - with the acquisition of his first 747. Sharing their first-hand stories are Darryl DMC McDaniels, Steven Tyler, Jane Fonda, Steve Wozniak, Richard Branson and Princess Diana's private secretary(n)</desc>

But for the animals that live in the jagged heart of the great Rocky Mountains, those myths are a savage reality. The mountains of the American West remain an epic stage, and even today, the iconic figures of the Old West have their real life counterparts in the animals that live there. A wolf gang preys on a moose calf and out here, only the strong will survive. Deadly banditos attack prairie dog villagers, and a young grizzly bear goes prospecting, desperate for edible gold. Mountain lions, lone rangers striking out to settle the vast living wilderness, survive by being as wild as the mountains themselves. This is the iconic Wild West as it truly is, as wild now as it was in the glory days of cinematic lore(n)</desc>

Charlotte Cartwright (Bates) and Alice Pratt (Woodard) may be from different sides of the tracks, yet over the years they've managed to nurture a strong and healthy friendship. That friendship is put to the ultimate test, however, when their adult children begin to act out in ways that neither parent ever saw coming. Alice's daughter Andrea (Sanaa Lathan) is married to a trusting husband named Chris (Rockmond Dunbar), but lately she's been betraying that trust by sleeping with her boss, William (Cole Hauser), who just so happens to be Charlotte's son. William is married to Jillian (KaDee Strickland), and in addition to being unfaithful, he's also scheming to take over the role of COO at his mother's lucrative construction firm. Meanwhile, Alice's other daughter, Pam (Taraji P. Henson), and her husband, Ben (Perry), a faithful family man and construction worker, have both recognized that their family has strayed from the course of righteousness, and become determined to help their loved ones back on the right path. When paternity secrets, shady double dealings, and a series of other scandals become too much for Charlotte and Alice to take, the two women set out on a cross-country trip in order to clear their heads and devise a plan for saving their families(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Bernie</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Richard Linklater teams with writer Skip Hollandsworth for this darkly comic docudrama detailing the unusual friendship between a likable Texas mortician and a wealthy but reviled widow, and the shocking crime that followed. Inspired by Hollandsworth's 1998 Texas Monthly article that first caught the attention of Linklater, Bernie takes place in Carthage, TX, where effeminate mortician Bernie Tiede (Jack Black) enjoys a reputation as a friendly and upstanding member of the community. Marjorie Nugent (Shirley MacLaine), on the other hand, couldn't hold a lower position on the local social scale. Repressed and bitter, nasty Marjorie has isolated herself from her neighbors, and as a result has been essentially shunned in her small town. The moment Bernie shows Marjorie a shred of kindness, she clings to him tightly and refuses to let go. Meanwhile, as Marjorie becomes Bernie's sugar mama and the pair becomes inseparable, the local rumor mill begins to churn. Eventually, her intense jealousy becomes too much for Bernie to take. When the caustic widow's body is discovered stuffed in her own freezer, local District Attorney Buck Davidson (Matthew McConaughey) vows that justice will be served, but he finds it difficult to build a convincing case against Bernie as the locals rally to his defense(n)</desc>

The group persevered and became the first team to reach the summit in October 2008.

However, a bogus neighborhood Santa Claus (Rickey Smiley) decides to help Craig and Day-Day share the wealth by robbing their apartment, and when he rips off their stereo, he also makes off with their rent money, which was hidden in the speaker cabinets. Desperate to make rent and have some money for Christmas presents, Craig and Day-Day land jobs at a local strip mall, where their fathers, Mr. Jones (John Witherspoon) and Uncle Elroy (Don "D.C." Curry), have gone into business together running a barbecue joint. Craig and Day-Day are installed as security guards, and while Craig tries to make time with Donna (K.D. Aubert), a saleswoman at the Pimp N' Ho's Boutique, and keep things orderly at Holy Moly's Doughnut Shop, Day-Day attempts to transform himself into a master of crime-fighting, which causes a lot more problems than it solves. Friday After Next is the first feature film from director Marcus Raboy, who previously directed music videos for Sting, Li'l Kim, Staind, and Friday After Next star Ice Cube(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Friday After Next</title>
    <desc lang="en">The gang from Friday and Next Friday are back in this urban comedy, in which Craig (Ice Cube) and Day-Day (Mike Epps) have finally moved out of their respective parents' homes and gotten an apartment together. However, a bogus neighborhood Santa Claus (Rickey Smiley) decides to help Craig and Day-Day share the wealth by robbing their apartment, and when he rips off their stereo, he also makes off with their rent money, which was hidden in the speaker cabinets. Desperate to make rent and have some money for Christmas presents, Craig and Day-Day land jobs at a local strip mall, where their fathers, Mr. Jones (John Witherspoon) and Uncle Elroy (Don "D.C." Curry), have gone into business together running a barbecue joint. Craig and Day-Day are installed as security guards, and while Craig tries to make time with Donna (K.D. Aubert), a saleswoman at the Pimp N' Ho's Boutique, and keep things orderly at Holy Moly's Doughnut Shop, Day-Day attempts to transform himself into a master of crime-fighting, which causes a lot more problems than it solves. Friday After Next is the first feature film from director Marcus Raboy, who previously directed music videos for Sting, Li'l Kim, Staind, and Friday After Next star Ice Cube(n)</desc>

Meanwhile, former high school beauty queen Michelle (Catherine Keener), the eldest of the three, lives a life of quiet desperation with two kids and a husband who refuses to understand her artistic yearnings. On the other hand, Elizabeth (Emily Mortimer), an actress whose career is about to take off, is in a loving marriage with James LeGros, though she remains insecure about her talents and abilities. Only the youngest daughter, eight-year-old African-American adoptee Annie (Raven Goodwin), seems likely to come out of the family without the neurosis or self-absorption of her elder siblings.

Sixto Diaz Rodriguez had the kind of musical career that every aspiring rock star fears -- lauded by critics but ignored by the public, he released two albums before unceremoniously disappearing from the spotlight. But while sales of Rodriguez's debut CD Cold Fact fell flat in the U.S., overseas in Australia and South Africa, the fans couldn't get enough. In apartheid-torn South Africa in particular, Cold Fact became something of an anti-establishment classic, eventually going platinum. Later, rumors began to swirl that Rodriguez had suffered a horrible death. When Rodriguez's second album Coming From Reality makes it's belated debut in South Africa, a pair of devoted fans take it upon themselves to uncover the facts surrounding the mysterious musician, and get the surprise of a lifetime while attempting to track the profits from his record sales(n)</desc>

Eventually, his investigation leads him from a kinky Hollywood action icon (James Van Der Beek) to a multi-talented pornographer (Snoop Dogg) and a physics-obsessed waitress (Autumn Reeser) with an insatiable sexual appetite. Ned's hard work starts to pay off, however, when he ventures deep into the New Mexico desert, where an eccentric billionaire (Sam Elliott) and a brilliant physicist (Jimmi Simpson) have hatched a plan to recreate the Big Bang. Now, with the cops hot on his tail and a potentially catastrophic experiment unfolding right beneath his feet, Ned races to find the girl and recover the diamonds before the world comes to an end(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Stolen Summer</title>
    <desc lang="en">Pete (Adi Stein) is an eight-year-old Catholic boy growing up in the suburbs of Chicago in the mid-'70s. Pete attends Catholic school, where as classes let out for the summer, he's admonished by a nun to follow the path of Lord, and not that of the Devil. Perhaps taking this message a bit too seriously, Pete decides it's his goal for the summer to help someone get into heaven; having been told that Catholicism is the only sure path to the kingdom of the Lord, Pete decides to convert a Jew to Catholicism in order to improve their standing in the afterlife. Hoping to find a likely candidate, Pete begins visiting a nearby synagogue, where he gets to know Rabbi Jacobson (Kevin Pollack), who responds to Pete's barrage of questions with good humor. Pete also makes friends with the Rabbi's son, Danny (Michael Weinberg), who is about the same age; when he learns that Danny is seriously ill, he decides Danny would be an excellent choice for conversion. When the priest at Pete's church (Brian Dennehy) informs Pete that all will be tested before they pass the Pearly Gates, he sets up a mini-decathlon and puts Danny in training as he attempts to reshape his spiritual thinking. Pete's parents (Bonnie Hunt and Aidan Quinn) aren't sure just what to make of Pete's new summer project, and as they become aquatinted with Rabbi Jacobson, they share their perspectives on the unexpected trials of parenting. Stolen Summer received more than its share of pre-release publicity; writer/director Pete Jones' script was the winner in a nationwide screenwriting competition sponsored by producers Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, with Miramax Pictures pledging a one-million-dollar budget and a theatrical release to the winning story. As part of the deal, the production of Stolen Summer was documented by a film crew from the premium cable network HBO, who aired a documentary miniseries about the making of the film, Project Greenlight(n)</desc>

Two years ago, a pair of thirty foot-long prehistoric crocodiles terrorized the residents of Lake Placid. While most of the locals assumed that the nightmare had ended when the murderous creatures were killed, local crocodile lover Sadie (Cloris Leachman) knows that the truth is far more terrifying. Beneath the surface of Lake Placid, the remaining predators have been quietly reproducing, awaiting the moment they will emerge from the water and cement their status on the top of the food chain. Now, as Sheriff Riley's rebellious teenage son (Shad Collins) departs for a relaxing lakeside camping trip, the desperate father realizes the danger that lies beneath the surface and races to confront a prehistoric predator that won't stop until it's consumed every last local(n)</desc>

James Bond's latest mission has gone horribly awry, resulting in the exposure of several undercover agents, and an all-out attack on M16. Meanwhile, as M (Judi Dench) plans to relocate the agency, emerging Chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee Mallory (Ralph Fiennes) raises concerns about her competence while attempting to usurp her position, and Q (Ben Whishaw) becomes a crucial ally. Now the only person who can restore M's reputation is 007.
