    <desc lang="en">Though ostensibly a family-oriented outing, Ivan Reitman's Kindergarten Cop ensures that fans of star Arnold Schwarzenegger's action films won't be disappointed by pumping up the Cop half of the equation to a surprisingly high degree. Schwarzenegger stars as John Kimble, an L.A. cop who learns that the ex-wife and son of his drug-dealer quarry Crisp (Richard Tyson) are living in secrecy in small-town Oregon. Kimble is partnered with Phoebe (Pamela Reed), a former teacher, who is slated to begin undercover work at the school where Crisp's ex is suspected of working under an assumed identity. However, Phoebe becomes ill, forcing rough, gruff Kimble to take over the kindergarten class instead(n)</desc>

The life of office worker Wesley Gibson (McAvoy) has been one of frustration, disappointment and anxiety; he has an overbearing boss, his girlfriend and his best friend are duplicitously having an affair, and he's on medication to calm his nerves. To top it all, he one day finds himself on the wrong end of an assassination attempt. Luckily, the agile, honed and lethal Fox (Jolie) is at hand to save his life. However, she also reveals that his recently deceased father was secretly a supremely skilled killer, and that it's her job to ensure that Wesley takes his place in the Fraternity, the mystical organisation overseen by Sloan (Freeman), which exists to rid the world of evil-doers. And so begins Wesley's journey to unlock his hitherto unsuspected innate deadly abilities and use them for good. The cinematography echoes the inventiveness of Bekmambetov's earlier movies and takes a Matrix-like delight in playing with the tempo and camera angles of the fight scenes(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Buddy Holly: Rave On</title>
    <desc lang="en">Rock 'n' roll started with Elvis, but some believe that pop music started with Buddy Holly and the Crickets. As a songwriter, Holly revolutionised the genre by introducing dynamic new rhythms and unpredictable melodies beyond its traditional blues roots. In his songs written and recorded in the late '50s, it is already possible to hear the beat group sound of the 1960s, and beyond. This documentary tells the story of Holly's tragically short life and career through interviews with those who knew him and worked with him. Contributors include Don McLean, Paul Anka, Don Everly, Hank Marvin and Bob Harris.(n)</desc>

However, they are also invisible by definition, and difficult to study. This documentary examines the work of astronomers and theoretical physicists who are trying to map a black hole, in the hope of discovering whether they are the key to solving the mystery of what existed before the Big Bang.(n)</desc>

All three work, at varying levels of the upper echelons, for the Boston global transportation systems giant GTX, which is keen to boost its share prices.

    <desc lang="en">(2008) Angelina Jolie, James McAvoy and Morgan Freeman star in this violent action adventure from Russian director Timur Bekmambetov (Nightwatch, Daywatch). The life of office worker Wesley Gibson (McAvoy) has been one of frustration, disappointment and anxiety; he has an overbearing boss, his girlfriend and his best friend are duplicitously having an affair, and he's on medication to calm his nerves. To top it all, he one day finds himself on the wrong end of an assassination attempt. Luckily, the agile, honed and lethal Fox (Jolie) is at hand to save his life. However, she also reveals that his recently deceased father was secretly a supremely skilled killer, and that it's her job to ensure that Wesley takes his place in the Fraternity, the mystical organisation overseen by Sloan (Freeman), which exists to rid the world of evil-doers. And so begins Wesley's journey to unlock his hitherto unsuspected innate deadly abilities and use them for good. The cinematography echoes the inventiveness of Bekmambetov's earlier movies and takes a Matrix-like delight in playing with the tempo and camera angles of the fight scenes(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">James Cox directs the sleazy Hollywood murder tale Wonderland, starring Val Kilmer as legendary porn star John Holmes. Using a non-linear plot structure, the film explores different perspectives of the quadruple homicide that occurred on July 1, 1981, in the Hollywood Hills. At the lowest point of his career and the height of his drug addiction, Holmes was implicated in the murders of the Wonderland gang: Ron Launius (Josh Lucas), Billy Deverell (Tim Blake Nelson), Barbara Richardson (Natasha Gregson Wagner), and Joy Miller (Janeane Garofalo). Launius' wife, Susan (Christina Applegate), was the only survivor. Led by Detective Sam Nico (Ted Levine), the police investigation reveals a dark criminal underworld surrounding Holmes, his disapproving wife, Sharon (Lisa Kudrow), and his innocent teenage girlfriend, Dawn Schiller (Kate Bosworth). Eric Bogosian stars as notorious Hollywood nightclub owner Eddie Nash. Wonderland premiered at the 2003 Toronto Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In this dark comedy, a group of retirees wants to save their homes -- but they're not typical senior citizens trying to make the most of their Social Security checks. Four aging former mobsters -- Joey "Bats" Pistella (Burt Reynolds), Bobby Bartellemeo (Richard Dreyfuss), Mike the Brick (Dan Hedaya), and Tony "The Mouth" Donato (Seymour Cassel) -- live in the same rundown Miami apartment complex, the Raj Mahal. New owners hope to clear out the current tenants and replace them with a younger, more lucrative clientele. But the veteran gangsters don't want to move, so to scrape up the extra rent money, they take a job executing the father of a Miami mob boss. They happen to know he's already dead, so all they have to do is make it look like they did the hit. Their problems start when loudmouthed ladies' man Tony tells too much to Ferris (Jennifer Tilly), a stripper, and soon she's talked him into murdering her mother (Lainie Kazan) in exchange for her silence. The Crew also features Carrie-Anne Moss as a detective and Jeremy Piven as a mob kingpin out to avenge his father's death(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Novelist William Peter Blatty based his best-seller on the last known Catholic-sanctioned exorcism in the United States. Blatty transformed the little boy in the 1949 incident into a little girl named Regan, played by 14-year-old Linda Blair. Suddenly prone to fits and bizarre behavior, Regan proves quite a handful for her actress-mother, Chris MacNeil (played by Ellen Burstyn, although Blatty reportedly based the character on his next-door neighbor Shirley MacLaine). When Regan gets completely out of hand, Chris calls in young priest Father Karras (Jason Miller), who becomes convinced that the girl is possessed by the Devil and that they must call in an exorcist: namely, Father Merrin (Max von Sydow). His foe proves to be no run-of-the-mill demon, and both the priest and the girl suffer numerous horrors during their struggles. The Exorcist received a theatrical rerelease in 2000, in a special edition that added 11 minutes of footage trimmed from the film's original release and digitally enhanced Chris Newman's Oscar-winning sound work(n)</desc>

Their problems start when loudmouthed ladies' man Tony tells too much to Ferris (Jennifer Tilly), a stripper, and soon she's talked him into murdering her mother (Lainie Kazan) in exchange for her silence. The Crew also features Carrie-Anne Moss as a detective and Jeremy Piven as a mob kingpin out to avenge his father's death(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Exorcist</title>
    <desc lang="en">Novelist William Peter Blatty based his best-seller on the last known Catholic-sanctioned exorcism in the United States. Blatty transformed the little boy in the 1949 incident into a little girl named Regan, played by 14-year-old Linda Blair. Suddenly prone to fits and bizarre behavior, Regan proves quite a handful for her actress-mother, Chris MacNeil (played by Ellen Burstyn, although Blatty reportedly based the character on his next-door neighbor Shirley MacLaine). When Regan gets completely out of hand, Chris calls in young priest Father Karras (Jason Miller), who becomes convinced that the girl is possessed by the Devil and that they must call in an exorcist: namely, Father Merrin (Max von Sydow). His foe proves to be no run-of-the-mill demon, and both the priest and the girl suffer numerous horrors during their struggles. The Exorcist received a theatrical rerelease in 2000, in a special edition that added 11 minutes of footage trimmed from the film's original release and digitally enhanced Chris Newman's Oscar-winning sound work(n)</desc>

Brought to light by the memorable Rodney King beating, police brutality has become a hot issue. It has even affected working conditions. The Los Angeles police department hardly has enough staff to work the streets due to a drop in enrollment and support. That condition is not surprising given the far-reaching amount of corruption in the system. Ex-police chief Daryl Gates remembers the King incident and the subsequent fall in popularity. Also recalled is the exposure of New York police corruption in all its forms. Frank Serpico investigated the toughest units and found a deep misuse of power.

    <desc lang="en">Documentary revisiting the pride of African lions featured in Africa's Giant Killers: Natural World, which detailed a clash between drought-weakened elephants and hungry big cats in the northern stretches of the Kalahari Desert in Botswana. This follow-up rejoins the pride at the start of the rainy season, when the departure of the elephants brings a whole host of new problems for the lions. The males begin to turn against each other, and one inexperienced lioness places her cubs in mortal danger as a rival group challenges the area's resident lions. Wild fires caused by lightning devastate the landscape, and as the dust begins to settle, the pride must once again face off with the elephants or risk starvation. Narrated by Imogen Stubbs.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In this documentary centered on legendary filmmaker John Ford's cinematic contributions to Allied morale during World War II, actor/musician Kris Kristofferson narrates as the How Green Was My Valley director turns his back on Tinseltown in order to fulfill his patriotic duty. By the time the United States became involved in World War II, John Ford was already a film legend, but when Uncle Sam came calling the veteran filmmaker eagerly packed his bags and set his sites on the frontlines. Though Ford did sustain battlefield injuries during the production of the Oscar-winning documentary The Battle of Midway, the remarkable film endeared him to patriotic American audiences across the country and his next wartime effort, 1943's December 7th, proceeded to earn the filmmaker yet another Oscar. In addition to featuring footage from these and other, lesser-known wartime films from Ford, this documentary also offers an intimate look at the complex filmmaker and explores his remarkable legacy through both archive footage and interviews with such notable directors as Oliver Stone and Peter Bogdanovich(n)</desc>

Twenty years later, the adult Quinn is the fire chief of a refortified castle community, responsible for dousing the blazes lit by the dragon's prodigious number of flame-spewing offspring, airborne juggernauts that have wreaked havoc across the globe, torching civilization and turning humans into an endangered species. Hope arrives in the form of Denton "Dragon Slayer" Van Zan, an American known to be the only man to ever kill one of the dragons, and Alex Jenson, a scientist/pilot who's a member of Van Zan's army, a zealous fighting force that includes a secret weapon: the Archangels, paratroopers using themselves as bait to attract and then dispatch the deadly beasts(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A workaholic architect, frustrated in his job but determined to make a better life for his family, is bestowed with a powerful universal remote that allows him more control over his life than he ever knew possible in director Frank Coraci's high-concept fantasy comedy. On the surface, Michael Newman (Adam Sandler) seems to have it all, yet with all the demands forced upon him by his ungrateful boss (David Hasselhoff), Michael finds that setting aside time to spend with his loving wife, Donna (Kate Beckinsale), and two picture-perfect children, Ben (Joseph Castanon) and Samantha (Tatum McCann), has grown increasingly difficult. When a frustrating bout with the television remote leads the overworked husband and father to a nearby Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond in search of a universal remote with the power to control all of his electronic devices, a curious peek into the back room leads Michael into the company of eccentric employee and talented inventor Morty (Christopher Walken). It seems that Morty has created a device that will not only allow Michael complete control over his television and stereo, but his entire life as well. As Michael discovers that the remarkable device has the power to muffle the barks of the family dog, zoom himself past an irritating quarrel with his wife, and even allow him to travel back and forth through time to different points in his life, the rush of being able to skip straight to the good parts in life soon leaves him feeling as if he's missing out on the total experience. Only when Michael begins to realize that the he has lost control of his life and the remote is now programming him does he finally learn that life is as much about the moments he'd rather forget as it is the moments he will always remember(n)</desc>

Lisa Simpson (voice of Yeardley Smith) has been looking forward to seeing a special exhibit of rare Egyptian lore at the Springtonian Museum called "the Treasures of Isis," and her mother Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) promises to take her on the show's final day. However, Marge's plans change when Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright) comes home with various items from "Yuk-ingham Palace," the neighborhood novelty shop, super-glued to his face and she has to take him to the doctor. While Marge insists Lisa must stay home, Lisa tricks her easily misled father Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) into giving his permission for her to take the bus to the museum. But Lisa misreads the schedule and ends up on the outskirts of Springfield, and she flies into a panic when she ends up in the city's Russian district. When Homer and Marge realize Lisa is lost, Homer leaps into action to find her, though his actions make a difficult situation all the more complicated. "Lost Our Lisa" was first aired on May 10, 1998(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Fast Times at Ridgemont High</title>
    <desc lang="en">Back in the late 1970s, author Cameron Crowe banked upon his youthful appearance to pose as a teen-aged high school student. The results of his hands-on research was the revelatory book Fast Times at Ridgemont High, which went on to spectacular success as a theatrical feature. The sociological inner lining of Crowe's book was sacrificed in favor of standard teen-movie dialogue and Animal House-style comedy, but the film is impossible to dislike, and it spawned a legion of future imitators. Ostensibly, the main characters are brother and sister Jennifer Jason Leigh and Judge Reinhold. However, the real breakthrough star is Sean Penn as the perpetually zoned-out Jeff Spicoli. It is Penn who has the film's most famous scene, wherein the decorum of teacher Hand (Ray Walston)'s classroom is interrupted by a pizza delivery. Fast Times at Ridgemont High was spun off into a TV series, the short-lived 1986 weekly Fast Times(n)</desc>

Lee quickly corners the would-be assassin, Kenji, but his shock at coming face-to-face with an old friend gives the baddie just enough time to escape. Kenji's trail leads the mismatched cops to Paris, where car chases and a sequence among the under-dressed dancers of the Folies Bergère await them, plus rather a lot of dodgy French stereotypes and a finale atop the Eiffel Tower. Also starring Youki Kudoh and Noémie Lenoir, together with, in unlikely cameos, Max von Sydow and Roman Polanski(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Fast Times at Ridgemont High</title>
    <desc lang="en">Back in the late 1970s, author Cameron Crowe banked upon his youthful appearance to pose as a teen-aged high school student. The results of his hands-on research was the revelatory book Fast Times at Ridgemont High, which went on to spectacular success as a theatrical feature. The sociological inner lining of Crowe's book was sacrificed in favor of standard teen-movie dialogue and Animal House-style comedy, but the film is impossible to dislike, and it spawned a legion of future imitators. Ostensibly, the main characters are brother and sister Jennifer Jason Leigh and Judge Reinhold. However, the real breakthrough star is Sean Penn as the perpetually zoned-out Jeff Spicoli. It is Penn who has the film's most famous scene, wherein the decorum of teacher Hand (Ray Walston)'s classroom is interrupted by a pizza delivery. Fast Times at Ridgemont High was spun off into a TV series, the short-lived 1986 weekly Fast Times(n)</desc>

Lee quickly corners the would-be assassin, Kenji, but his shock at coming face-to-face with an old friend gives the baddie just enough time to escape. Kenji's trail leads the mismatched cops to Paris, where car chases and a sequence among the under-dressed dancers of the Folies Bergère await them, plus rather a lot of dodgy French stereotypes and a finale atop the Eiffel Tower.

    <title lang="en">The Last Mimzy</title>
    <desc lang="en">An intergalactic package discovered on the beach holds a myriad of fantastic discoveries for siblings Noah and Emma Wilder in The Last Mimzy, studio head-turned-director Bob Shaye's wondrous sci-fi fantasy parable. The children stumble onto their discovery amid a trip to the family beach house, and find inside of the crate strange crystals that Emma levitates with her mind, as well as the Mimzy -- a stuffed bunny with a built-in supercomputer that advances its possessor's brain by great leaps and bounds by whispering into the person's ear. Meanwhile, via interaction with the box and its contents, Noah gains the ability to converse with spiders and instructs them to build miniature bridges. He also etches complex Tibetan mandalas, and somehow manages to black out half of Seattle. The children naturally keep these happenings (and the box) from their mom and dad (Joely Richardson and Timothy Hutton), but in time the kids set their sights higher and embark on correcting huge problems that cannot be missed. Rainn Wilson (The Office) co-stars as the children's hippie science teacher; New Age expert Bruce Joel Rubin (Ghost, Jacob's Ladder) and Toby Emmerich co-authored the script, adapting the 1943 short story Mimsy Were the Borogoves, by Lewis Padgett(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Glenn Close goes to the dogs once again in this sequel to 101 Dalmatians, Disney's 1996 live-action adaptation of their beloved animated classic. After three years in prison, Cruella De Vil (Close) is judged to have paid her debt to society and is set free, as she pledges to have nothing to do with animal fur (especially dogs) ever again. Meanwhile, Kevin (Ioan Gruffudd) operates an animal shelter that has fallen on hard times; unless he's able to find new financial support, the lost dogs he's been caring for will have nowhere to go. Kevin and his girlfriend Chloe (Alice Evans), who happens to be Cruella's parole officer, get the idea of bringing their plight to the people through the press, but media reports of the shelter's problems attract an unlikely benefactor -- Cruella. While Ms. De Vil claims the purest of intentions, it seems the shelter is housing a large number of dalmatians, and in cahoots with mad fashion designer Monsieur Le Pelt (Gérard Depardieu), she plans to turn the puppies into haute couture. 102 Dalmatians was the first live-action feature for director Kevin Lima, who previously helmed two animated features for Disney, A Goofy Movie and Tarzan(n)</desc>

Kate Holbrook (Fey) is a 37-year-old business executive who has always put her professional life before her personal life, but these days her biological clock is ticking louder than ever before. As with everything else she has accomplished in life, Kate is determined to have a child on her own terms. Unfortunately for Kate, the chance of her ever becoming pregnant is slim to none. Undaunted, a willful Kate drafts South Philly working-class girl Angie Ostrowiski (Poehler) -- a woman who may just be her polar opposite -- to be a surrogate mother. Subsequently informed by the head of the surrogacy center (Sigourney Weaver) that her surrogate is indeed pregnant, the excited mother-to-be soon purchases every child-rearing book she can find and excitedly begins the nesting process. But life hasn't quit throwing Kate curveballs just yet, because when a pregnant Angie shows up on her doorstep with no place to live, the woman who once thrived on order finds her life descending into chaos. Now, as Kate attempts to transform Angie into the ideal expectant mother, this odd couple will discover that families aren't always biological, but occasionally formed through friendship as well. Writer Michael McCullers, who authored the screenplays for Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and Undercover Brother in addition to working on Saturday Night Live, makes his feature directorial debut with a self-penned screenplay(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Accused of cheating and desperate to prove his innocence, an eighteen-year-old orphan from the slums of Mumbai reflects back on his tumultuous life while competing to win 20 million rupees on India's Who Wants to Be a Millionaire in Danny Boyle's inspirational drama. Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) may not have a penny to his name, but that could all change in a matter of hours. He's one question away from taking the top prize on India's most popular television game show, but as with everything else in Jamal's life, it isn't going to be easy. Arrested by police under suspicion of cheating, Jamal is interrogated by the authorities. The police simply can't believe that a common "slumdog" could possibly possess the knowledge to get this far in the game, and in order to convince them of how he gained such knowledge, Jamal begins reflecting back on his childhood. As young boys, Jamal and his older brother, Salim, lived in squalor, and lost their mother in a mob attack on Muslims. Subsequently forced to rely on their own wits to survive, the desperate siblings fell back on petty crime, eventually befriending adorable yet feisty young Latika as they sought out food and shelter on the unforgiving streets of Mumbai. Though life on the streets was never easy, Jamal's experiences ultimately instilled in him the knowledge he needed to answer the tough questions posed to him on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. And though Jamal makes a convincing case for himself, one question still remains: why would a young man with no apparent desire for wealth or fame be so determined to win big on a national game show? Of course, it won't be long until everyone finds out the answer to this burning question, because as Jamal sits down to find out whether he will be rich beyond his wildest dreams, 60 million viewers remain transfixed to their televisions eager to see if he'll correctly answer the final question(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Peep World</title>
    <desc lang="en">A family's dirty laundry get aired out in public, and not everyone is happy about it in this dark comedy from director Barry W. Blaustein. Nathan (Ben Schwartz) is a writer who has recently published a best-selling novel that's being made into a major motion picture. Nathan is feeling very good about himself, but his siblings aren't so happy for him -- the book is a very thinly disguised version of his family's wildly dysfunctional history, and nearly everyone close to him can see themselves in its key characters. Nathan's older sister, Cheri (Sarah Silverman), a struggling actress, is so outraged that she's considering taking her brother to court, especially since the film version of the book is being shot outside her apartment and her father's new (and much younger) girlfriend (Alicia Witt) has been cast in the role patterned after her. Nathan's book has also become a thorn in the side of wildly irresponsible Joel (Rainn Wilson), who is on the run from loan sharks, and Jack (Michael C. Hall), whose career as an architect is crumbling almost as quickly as his marriage to Laura (Judy Greer). When the family gathers to celebrate the 70th birthday of their father (Ron Rifkin), along with their mother (Lesley Ann Warren) and her new husband (Nicholas Hormann), it makes for an evening with explosive potential. Peep World also features narration by comedian Lewis Black(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Kick-Ass</title>
    <desc lang="en">Adapted from Mark Millar's hyper-violent comic book of the same name, director Matthew Vaughn's (Layer Cake) vigilante superhero film tells the tale of an average New York teenager who decides to don a costume and fight crime. Comic book geek Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) may not have good coordination or special powers, but that doesn't mean he isn't a fully capable crime fighter. After purchasing a flashy wet suit on the Internet, Dave starts busting up baddies with nothing but brute force. He calls himself Kick-Ass, and he can take a beating as good as he can dish one out. Before long, Kick-Ass has become a local sensation, and others are following his lead. Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) are a father-daughter crime-fighting duo who have set their sights on local mob heavy Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong).

    <title lang="en">Die Hard</title>
    <desc lang="en">It's Christmas time in L.A., and there's an employee party in progress on the 30th floor of the Nakatomi Corporation building. The revelry comes to a violent end when the partygoers are taken hostage by a group of terrorists headed by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), who plan to steal the 600 million dollars locked in Nakatomi's high-tech safe. In truth, Gruber and his henchmen are only pretending to be politically motivated to throw the authorities off track; also in truth, Gruber has no intention of allowing anyone to get out of the building alive. Meanwhile, New York cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) has come to L.A. to visit his estranged wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), who happens to be one of the hostages. Disregarding the orders of the authorities surrounding the building, McClane, who fears nothing (except heights), takes on the villains, armed with one handgun and plenty of chutzpah. Until Die Hard came along, Bruce Willis was merely that wisecracking guy on Moonlighting. After the film's profits started rolling in, Willis found himself one of the highest-paid and most sought-after leading men in Hollywood(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Kick-Ass</title>
    <desc lang="en">Adapted from Mark Millar's hyper-violent comic book of the same name, director Matthew Vaughn's (Layer Cake) vigilante superhero film tells the tale of an average New York teenager who decides to don a costume and fight crime. Comic book geek Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) may not have good coordination or special powers, but that doesn't mean he isn't a fully capable crime fighter. After purchasing a flashy wet suit on the Internet, Dave starts busting up baddies with nothing but brute force. He calls himself Kick-Ass, and he can take a beating as good as he can dish one out. Before long, Kick-Ass has become a local sensation, and others are following his lead. Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) are a father-daughter crime-fighting duo who have set their sights on local mob heavy Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong). They're doing a decent job of dismantling Frank's sizable underworld empire when Kick-Ass gets drawn into the fray. But Frank's men play rough, and his son, Chris (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), is about to become Kick-Ass' very first arch nemesis.

They discover that the pyramid is home to two species of aliens. One regards humans as incubators for their young. The other are intergalactic sportsmen who hunt their opposite number for fun. And Weyland's team are caught in the middle. Paul W Anderson's pairing of two of film's most iconic extra-terrestrial monsters is a roller-coaster action movie, with a surprising, shocking coda(n)</desc>

With Ryan's actions now affecting everyone else, the men have a choice. Do they bring him back into the fold?.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Australia v Germany (Kick-off 4.00pm). Darragh Maloney presents coverage of both teams' opening Group B encounter, held at the Fisht Olympic Stadium in Sochi, Russia. Australia qualified by winning the 2015 AFC Asian Cup and have a solid record in this competition, having finished as runners-up in 1997 and third in 2001. However, their last appearance was in 2005, when they finished bottom of their group, and they face a tough task against the world champions, who were third when they last entered this tournament 12 years ago on home soil. With analysis from Damien Duff and Didi Hamann, and commentary by George Hamilton and Jim Beglin.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">First to Fly.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The veteran naturalist examines the world of flight, travelling across the globe to chart the evolutionary story of those creatures who seemingly defy the rules of gravity by taking to the air. Initially focusing on insects, Attenborough meets a descendant of the dragonfly, before examining the Atlas beetle, which tends to restrict flight to times when it needs a mate or a fresh supply of food. More aesthetically pleasing is a group of beautiful tropical butterflies, followed by an in-depth study into the blow fly - the jet fighter of insects.(n)</desc>

He then moves on to the floating forests of Ecuador to find out what makes the humble hummingbird tick, before ending his journey at the Gomantong bat caves of Borneo - a place he first filmed in 1972 - witnessing a mass exodus of the creatures.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Robert De Niro makes his directorial debut with this expanded adaptation of Chazz Palminteri's one-character play. De Niro's role of Lorenzo Anello, an Italian-America bus driver, is secondary to the part of his son Calogero. The top dog in Calogero's Bronx neighborhood is flashy "wiseguy" Sonny. When the boy witnesses Sonny commit a murder, he honors the code of the streets and refuses to tell the cops. Sonny befriends him and introduces the impressionable youngster to the creature comforts that mob connections can bring. But though he idolizes Sonny, the boy loves and respects his decent, honest father. It takes a major tragedy for the 17-year-old boy (now played by Lillo Brancato) to decide his true course in life(n)</desc>

Looking for help, the four happen upon the farmhouse of an elderly couple, Elvin (Richard Little) and May (Barbara Wilhide), which is located next to a huge barn. Elvin and May have already become lost in the darkness of the barn, and soon two of the lost travelers are suffering the same fate as they search for friendly strangers. However, while they can barely see a hand in front of their face, they discover they're not alone in the barn, which has become home to a huge swarm of bloodthirsty bats. The Roost is framed by an introduction and postscript from a television horror show host, played by Tom Noonan(n)</desc>

As the days go by, their relationship develops until, after a heavy night drinking whisky, they make passionate love. Initially denying the attraction each feels for the other, they go their separate ways at the end of the job. Both marry and have children but meet regularly to ignite their undying passion for each other, living desperate, unfulfilled lives between each meeting until the untimely death of one leaves the other broken and devastated. Ang Lee's Oscar-winning drama is a bold, emotional story of a passion that cannot be denied but must be hidden from a world that can only condemn it. Premiere(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Bride of the Wind</title>
    <desc lang="en">Bruce Beresford (Driving Miss Daisy) delivers this fact-based drama about one of the most fascinating private lives of the 20th century. Alma Schindler (Sarah Wynter) was one of the most renowned young beauties in turn-of-the-century Vienna, sought after as a romantic conquest by some of the most famous men in the city, including the artist Gustav Klimt (August Schmolzer). She is won, however, by the most challenging and enigmatic artistic figure of them all, composer/conductor Gustav Mahler (Jonathan Pryce). His one demand is that she give up her own aspirations as a composer, which she has nursed for years. She agrees, and their marriage proves to be a devoted yet loveless union, producing two children but leaving Alma bereft of affection. She suppresses her frustrations as her husband's star rises, sublimating her ambitions completely. His career advances yield extraordinary music but equally notable controversies, and the marriage is riven by stress. When their oldest daughter dies, Alma's health is broken. While convalescing at a sanitarium, she meets another patient, Walter Gropius (Simon Verhoeven). He is gentle and attentive, and they begin an affair, which her husband accidentally learns of later. Their marriage survives, but Mahler also knows that he is a doomed man because of a damaged heart. After his death, Alma Mahler marries Gropius, an ambitious young architect with revolutionary ideas. Their marriage lasts but a few years, for Alma is drawn to another man, the artist Oskar Kokoschka (Vincent Perez). Kokoschka is young, iconoclastic, and daring -- all of the things that the career- and status-oriented Gropius isn't. Their affair yields a renowned painting of Alma that Kokoschka calls Bride of the Wind, a depiction of their passion amid a storm-swept background. They also conceive a child that Alma decides not to carry to term. She returns to Gropius for a time, while Kokoschka sells the painting for enough money to buy a commission in the army, and he is reported killed in action during World War I. Finally, after leaving Gropius, Alma meets a gifted author, Franz Werfel (Gregor Seberg), whom she marries. Her past catches up with her in an odd way, however, when Kokoschka returns, having survived the war and captivity -- he is still obsessed with Alma, to the point that he walks around Vienna in the company of a life-size doll of her, which he destroys in a fit of anger one night at a party. Meanwhile, in Alma's life with Franz Werfel, she finally finds peace and fulfillment, even as a composer -- the movie ends with a 1925 recital at which soprano Frances Alda (Renee Fleming) performed Alma Mahler Werfel's songs(n)</desc>

The new man (McGregor, in an un-named role) is dispatched to the ex-PM's swish home in the States, where he now resides. As the writer begins his task, he thinks it odd that he's not allowed access to his predecessor's draft but gets on with the work, under pressure from all sides to finish the job quickly. But, later, he uncovers documents, seemingly left by the dead man, which throw a new light on everything: they suggest Lang and his wealthy friends have very dark secrets, ones they'd possibly even kill for in order to keep them hidden.

    <desc lang="en">A corporate workaholic finds that her decision to work late on Christmas Eve has potentially deadly consequences in this thriller starring Wes Bentley and Rachel Nichols. It's that time of the year, and as the snow falls outside and families gather around the dinner table, Angela vows to close one last deal before the holiday. Now late for her family gathering, Angela rushes down to the garage in hopes of racing home and catching dinner before it gets cold. When her car refuses to start, her phone fails to get a signal, and everyone else has already left, it begins to appear as if Angela's luck may have finally run out. Thankfully, a friendly security guard appears and offers to lend a helping hand. During the course of discussion, the security guard flirtatiously invites Angela to share the Christmas dinner he has prepared in the parking office -- an offer that the high-powered corporate climber laughingly dismisses. The next thing Angela knows, she wakes up tied to a chair in the cold security office located on level P2. It appears as if the security guard's invitation wasn't optional, and that Christmas dinner was the last thing on his mind. Upon realizing just how serious her situation truly is, Angela struggles to escape her subterranean prison and make it out so that she might live to see another Christmas morning(n)</desc>

Something deep within Sam begins to stir however, when he discovers his late son's demo tapes, and decides to take a listen. Deeply moved by his son's artistry and determined not to let the boy's dreams die with him, Sam determines to learn each song note-for-note, and later summons the courage to perform one of them publicly. That performance, in turn, prompts aspiring musician Quentin (Anton Yelchin) to approach Sam, and together they form a band that transforms their lives in ways neither ever dreamt possible.

Tim Blake Nelson portrays the patriarch, a boozy lawyer who oversees the lives of his children with cynical monologues delivered through an alcoholic haze. Quentin, the oldest child, goes to Harvard, but he's very close with Caddy, the only daughter in the family who has a child out of wedlock. Second son Jason attempts to rule the family with an iron fist, but he's full of resentment towards Caddy's bastard child. All of them attempt to care for the developmentally disabled Benjy (Franco). Franco employs a fractured approach to the narrative in an attempt to capture Faulkner's distinctive prose style.

    <title lang="en">The Black Stallion</title>
    <desc lang="en">Featuring extraordinary cinematography that imbues the classic Walter Farely horse story with the hues and feeling of a great painting and telling the touching (without undue sentiment) yet truly exciting tale of a boy and his horse, The Black Stallion is truly a classic family film. The story begins on a storm-tossed sea in a large steamer heading west from the Middle East. Among the passengers are young Alec and his jovial father. Also aboard is a dangerously wild, but glorious black stallion. Alec is fascinated by the almost outworldly creature and gingerly slips him some sugar cubes. That night a terrible storm overtakes the ship and it sinks, killing everyone aboard but Alec and the horse, whom he manages to free before the ship goes down. Caught up in the horse's lead rope and floundering in the rough seas, Alec nearly drowns. But with Alec towed along behind the strongly swimming horse, the two make it to the safety of a tiny desert island. It is here, as boy and horse struggle to survive, that a great bond is formed. Initially theirs is a relationship formed out of necessity, but eventually the two become the best of friends so that when a rescue ship finally comes, Alec refuses to leave without the horse. Once back in his urban American home, Alec must face new challenges and figure out what to do with his still half-wild friend. Once again it is "the Black" who provides the solution when he escapes and ends up at the barn of a former jockey who sees in the steed great potential on the track. With his help, Alec and "the Black" enter an important horse race and this leads to the story's exciting and suspenseful conclusion(n)</desc>

Deducing that they've somehow passed through a time warp, the crew of Flight 33, headed by Captain Farver (John Anderson), desperately seek out a way of returning to their own time. Managing to retrieve the tailwind, the crew succeeds in its goal -- almost. Written by Rod Serling, with technical advice from his novelist brother Robert J. Serling (then an aviation writer for American Airlines), this Twilight Zone episode is highlighted by some disturbingly convincing "monster" animation, courtesy of film producer Jack H. Harris (of Dinosaurus! fame) and the special-effects wizards at Project Unlimited. "The Odyssey of Flight 33" first aired February 24, 1961(n)</desc>

A powerful underwater tremor has released scores of man-eating prehistoric fish into the waters, and now it's up to a group of unlikely heroes to band together and defeat the razor-toothed predators. With time running out and the aquatic carnivores taking over, one brave heroine (Elisabeth Shue) will risk everything to save the lake and prevent her family from becoming fish food.

    <desc lang="en">Donald P Borchers' remake of the supernatural horror, based on a short story by Stephen King, and starring David Anders, Kandyse McClure and Daniel Newman. Back in 1963 a dreadful drought hit Nebraska, and it had a devastating effect on one small, isolated town. Out in the parched fields, one of the community's children had a fire-and-brimstone dream in which it was revealed by an entity called He Who Walks Behind the Rows that the blight was due to the erroneous ways of the adults. The solution was simple: everyone over the age of 18 must die; and so the children slaughtered the town's adult population. From that point on, everyone would be ritually sacrificed upon reaching their 19th birthday to appease He Who Walks... Now, 12 years on, Burton and VIcky Stanton have the misfortune of stumbling upon the ill-fated outpost. Will they make it out alive - or are they destined to come to the same gory end as the others?(n)</desc>

To prepare Joey for his big date the following night, Rachel eagerly agrees to go out with him for a rare night on the town, but when each is pleasantly surprised with their newfound compatibility, they begin to regard each other in a way that no one could have predicted. Meanwhile, Chandler sets a new record on Monica's new Ms Pac-Man machine, but his three-letter ID might prove too offensive when Ben visits. And Ross is finally allowed to teach an honours class but its location on the far side of town means that he must break the land speed record to get there on time(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Fore, Father. When Lois (voice of Alex Borstein) announces that it's time for "spring cleaning," Peter (voice of Seth MacFarlane) is anxious to get out of it. He ends up taking Chris (voice of Seth Green) on a fishing trip with his neighbors, Joe (voice of Patrick Warburton) and Cleveland (voice of Mike Henry) and their children. Cleveland is also eager to get away as his wife is having a visit from her "Aunt Flo." "Loretta likes to personify her menses in humorous ways," he needlessly explains. On the disastrous trip ("All we caught was a tire, a boot, a tin can, and this book of clichés"), Joe criticizes Peter's parenting skills, and says he's turning Chris into a slacker. Peter responds by getting Chris a job shagging golf balls at a driving range. But Peter is soon distracted from his own son by Cleveland, Jr. (Henry), who can drive a ball 300 yards. Cleveland warns him that the boy has a short attention span, but Peter is determined to turn the boy into a pro, and enters him into the golf club's "Man-Boy Golf Tournament," all the while ignoring his own son. Meanwhile, Stewie (MacFarlane) destroys Brian's (MacFarlane) library. Revenge is served cold when Stewie returns from getting his first vaccination, and Brian soon has him convinced that he's been injected with some kind of mind control serum. This episode features the voice talents of Gary Cole and Nicole Sullivan. The cold opening, a cruel parody of Little House on the Prairie, was edited from FOX's original airing of the episode, but was restored in repeats(n)</desc>
