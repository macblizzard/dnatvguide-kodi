Roping in his wife Carol, daughter Abby and a selection of favoured workmates, Paul and his team begin work on the ultra-modern, five-bedroom build, and Kevin McCloud reveals how extreme weather, exhaustion, and rapidly dwindling funds place the entire project in jeopardy.(n)</desc>

Taking over from the earlier series' host Regis Philbin was Meredith Vieira of The View. To make certain that the series would not be bankrupted after its first week on the air, the questions posed to contestants were considerably harder than those on the prime-time incarnation. Also, the famous "fastest finger" round was eliminated, taking some of the pressure off the contestants when they struggled to come up with answers. The most noteworthy change from the original version was the absence of Regis Philbin's familiar catchphrases: One would never hear Meredith Vieira chime in with the legendary "Is that your final answer?"

    <title lang="en">Death Defying Acts</title>
    <desc lang="en">My Brilliant Career and Oscar and Lucinda director Gillian Armstrong explores the final feat of the greatest illusionist ever to deceive a live audience in this docudrama concerning Harry Houdini's obsessive quest to find proof of an afterlife. The year is 1926, and Houdini (Guy Pearce) is an international superstar. Not only does the illusionist's otherworldly ability to bend reality hold audiences completely enthralled, but his easy charm finds him winning the hearts of his growing legion of fans as well. Yet behind Houdini's winning smile resides the restless heart of a tortured soul. Isolated by fame and drowning in regret over having not been present to hear his mother's last words, Houdini sets out in tour of Scotland and announces that he will pay 10,000 dollars to anyone who can prove spiritual contact with his deceased mother. But in his determination to prove that there is life after death, Houdini also becomes the target of countless charlatans, scam artists, and self-proclaimed spiritualists. Of course, stunning psychic Mary McGregor (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and her daughter/sidekick, Benji (Saoirse Ronan), seem remarkably sincere in their supernatural talents, yet that doesn't mean that the pair doesn't have their own ulterior motives for making a connection with the world-famous magic man(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Denzel Washington stars in this powerful and moving film about the early days of forced racial integration in the US, and how a high school football team helped bring in a new era of racial harmony. It's 1971. One all-white school and one all-black school have been forcibly merged, and a black coach appointed over the existing white football coach. It could be a recipe for disaster, but the two men shares certain qualities: integrity, honour and a strong work ethic. Together they mould a group of angry, disillusioned young men into a dynamic, winning football team - and provide a model for future integration. A top class film with a superb cast(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Rooster Cogburn</title>
    <desc lang="en">(1975) John Wayne reprises his role as Federal Marshal "Rooster" Cogburn, for which he won his sole Oscar in True Grit , six years earlier. This time out, the rambunctious, one-eyed lawman finds himself in pursuit of a gang of outlaws who've made off with a consignment of nitro-glycerine. As they flee, the violent criminals stumble across a village in Indian Territory, where they rape the women and murder most of the inhabitants. Bible-bashing spinster Eula Goodnight (Katharine Hepburn) survives the massacre and insists on Cogburn taking her along to avenge her father's killing. Despite the grim start to the adventure, Stuart Miller's light-hearted Western is shot through with humour and is especially noted for the sparky exchanges between the two lead stars.

With the bar so high this early on, the rest of the contestants will be keen not to be left behind - although with talented dancers like Danny, Louise and Claudia, that's unlikely to happen as they all take to the floor for a fifth time. Presented by Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman. The results are tomorrow at 7.15pm.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Gary Lineker presents highlights of the latest Premier League matches, including Bournemouth v Tottenham Hotspur, and Liverpool v West Bromwich Albion. Spurs are being touted as possible title contenders, especially after their recent exceptional victory over Manchester City, and were looking to continue the away form that has already seen them claim notable wins at Stoke City and Middlesbrough. Liverpool are also tipped by many for honours this year, and have proven themselves to be a potent attacking force under Jurgen Klopp, but it remained to be seen whether they could penetrate a West Brom defence organised by Tony Pulis with as much ease as some of the others they have faced.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Genesis: Together &amp; Apart</title>
    <desc lang="en">Many schoolboys get together to form a band, but few of them go on to become multi-million-selling recording artists - but that's what happened to Genesis. Its core members - Peter Gabriel, Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks - met at Charterhouse, a public school in Surrey, and began playing together with two other students in 1967. A few years and personnel changes later (including the addition of drummer Phil Collins) and the classic line-up was in place. But relationships within the band were fraught; Gabriel left for a solo career in 1975, and Rutherford, Collins, Banks and Steve Hackett carried on without him. Here, they're back together again to discuss their careers. Rare archive footage helps tell the story.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Rufus Hound and his guests consider futuristic cars of the past. Martin Kemp proposes that the 1966 Jensen FF, part of the Interceptor range, was way ahead of its time technically. The innovative Rover P6 from 1963 was not very futuristic to look at, but it was one of the most forward-thinking cars ever made. Jonny Smith believes that it was the pinnacle of the car industry. Plus, Dom Joly takes a DeLorean out for a spin and recalls the man behind the car, John DeLorean. A notable failure, the Sinclair C5, is also celebrated. Last in the series.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Tower Bridge.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">For years, London's East End was denied a new bridge because of the need to guarantee passage of ships up and down the Thames. For years, the greatest engineers of the age hunted for a design that would keep both road and water traffic moving. As Rob Bell explains, the solution came from architect Horace Jones, whose revolutionary design, with its thousand-tonne opening sections, was powered by nothing more than water. Rob also explains the bridge was lucky to survive the Second World War, having been a target for German V-1 flying bombs.(n)</desc>

Bored with the middle-class success financed by his investment banking job, Richard Cooper questions his apparently perfect life with a lovely wife, two children and a home in the suburbs when a sultry old acquaintance, Nikki, comes back into his life. Frustrated by the lack of sex in his marriage and plagued by a rich fantasy life, Richard at first takes Nikki's declaration that she just wants to be friends at face value.

Steve Buscemi plays Richard's best friend, George(n)</desc>

Leonard Peltier is one of the most well-known political prisoners in America. Serving two life sentences for the murders of federal agents in 1975, the Nobel Peace Prize nominee maintains his innocence while blasting the intimidating techniques of the U.S. government. The shootout which put him in prison is known as "the Incident at Oglala" and has roots going back to the massacre at Wounded Knee. Peltier claims he is serving time for his radical views on Native American rights while the government thinks it has finally tamed a violent troublemaker. But, beyond the political ramifications, Peltier's case is full of inconsistencies. There are no witnesses or physical evidence to identify Peltier as the shooter. During his trial, he was deprived of crucial background testimony which established the FBI's reign of terror over the South Dakota reservation. Peltier continues his appeal for justice while many are left wondering what really happened that fateful day(n)</desc>

But his mysterious death at just 19 years of age has never been explained. Now, Dallas Campbell reveals new scientific research aimed at getting to the truth. A CT scan of the pharaoh's mummified body creates a full-size image of the real Tutankhamun, while DNA analysis uncovers a shocking secret about his family background - and the genetic trail leads to a revolutionary new theory about his sudden and unexpected death.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Combining elements of A Christmas Carol and Rain Man (1988), this modern-day parable of greed and redemption was crafted with generous helpings of sentimentality by director Mike Nicholas. Harrison Ford stars as Henry Turner, a slick, ruthless corporate attorney willing to spin any falsehood to win a case. A bully to his teenage daughter Rachel (Mikki Allen), Henry also cheats on his wife Sarah (Annette Bening) and treats everyone from the maid to his assistant with cruel selfishness. Stepping out to a local mini-market for a pack of cigarettes late one night, Henry accidentally interrupts a burglary and is shot in the head by a stick-up artist. After a long coma, Henry survives only to find that he has no memory and must re-learn everything from reading to tying his shoes. Reborn as a friendly, childlike innocent, Henry charms his therapist (Bill Nunn) and reconnects with his wife and daughter, only to uncover some secrets about how truly appalling he once was(n)</desc>

Dr Guy Luthan (Grant) is working through another hard shift in the emergency room when he treats a delusional, homeless patient who exhibits wildly erratic and unfamiliar symptoms. To add to the mystery, the man is naked, except for a medical bracelet on his wrist that can only have come from another hospital. Luthan is unable to save the patient, but neither can he forget the unusual circumstances surrounding the man's arrival. He resolves to look into the case further, but when he looks for the autopsy report he finds that it is missing - and so is the body. Unwilling to let the matter drop, despite strong urging from his superiors at the hospital, Luthan continues to search for answers. As this search progresses, he experiences more bad 'luck': his apartment is broken into and he is loses his job. Clearly somebody wants him to stop his investigation. Undeterred, Luthan pursues the truth, and the trail leads to internationally renowned neurologist Dr. Lawrence Myrick (Gene Hackman), acclaimed for his research into regenerating spinal tissue. Myrick's research has the potential to change the world for countless victims of spinal injury - but does this excuse the terrible price being paid by innocent victims?(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Extreme Measures</title>
    <desc lang="en">Intelligent thriller about an idealistic young doctor (Hugh Grant) who uncovers a sinister world of illegal medical experiments. Dr Guy Luthan (Grant) is working through another hard shift in the emergency room when he treats a delusional, homeless patient who exhibits wildly erratic and unfamiliar symptoms. To add to the mystery, the man is naked, except for a medical bracelet on his wrist that can only have come from another hospital. Luthan is unable to save the patient, but neither can he forget the unusual circumstances surrounding the man's arrival. He resolves to look into the case further, but when he looks for the autopsy report he finds that it is missing - and so is the body. Unwilling to let the matter drop, despite strong urging from his superiors at the hospital, Luthan continues to search for answers. As this search progresses, he experiences more bad 'luck': his apartment is broken into and he is loses his job. Clearly somebody wants him to stop his investigation. Undeterred, Luthan pursues the truth, and the trail leads to internationally renowned neurologist Dr. Lawrence Myrick (Gene Hackman), acclaimed for his research into regenerating spinal tissue. Myrick's research has the potential to change the world for countless victims of spinal injury - but does this excuse the terrible price being paid by innocent victims?(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Flight of the Phoenix</title>
    <desc lang="en">Based on a novel by Elleston Trevor, director John Moore's The Flight of the Phoenix is a remake of a 1965 film of the same name starring film icon James Stewart. The story revolves around the plight of Captain Frank Towns (Dennis Quaid), a pilot whose C-119 cargo plane full of oil workers could not withstand the violent winds of a desert sandstorm. Stranded in the harsh terrain of Mongolia's Gobi Desert (a departure from the original, in which the plane crashed in the Sahara), Frank and his navigator face an equal challenge in maintaining order among the survivors. The group of oilmen had planned on an uneventful trip to shut off a group of rigs falling below their productivity expectations -- not fending for their very lives. Before long, some men are revealed as cowards, while others exhibit a surprising show of strength, all the while hoping that the wreckage of the original plane can be salvaged before a Lord of the Flies situation occurs. Miranda Otto is featured in a supporting role, as well as Giovanni Ribisi and Tyrese Gibson(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Last Temptation of Krust. A veritable who's who of famous comedians have come to Springfield for a special fund-raising event, but Bart Simpson (voice of Nancy Cartwright) is appalled to discover that local legend Krusty the Clown (voice of Dan Castellaneta) hasn't been added to the bill. Bart persuades organizer and headliner Jay Leno to give Krusty a spot in the show, but the clown's offensive and out-of-date material goes over like a lead balloon, and subsequent attempts by Krusty to juice up his act fail miserably. Convinced he spent more time on marketing than material, Krusty decides to retire, but in his farewell show, he delivers a venomous screed against the current state of comedy and television that brings down the house. It becomes clear the world wants an angrier and edgier Krusty, and the clown works up a new act to match his new image. However, when a pair of auto company admen ask Krusty to endorse a new sport utility vehicle, the clown's rejection of corporate culture proves to be short-lived. "The Last Temptation of Krust" features voice cameos from Jay Leno, Steven Wright, Janeane Garofalo, Bobcat Goldthwait and Bruce Baum, all appearing as themselves, while Hank Williams Jr. contributes the SUV jingle. The episode first aired on February 22, 1998(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Drumline</title>
    <desc lang="en">After decades of movies about college sports, the bands who take the field at halftime finally get their day in the sun in this musical comedy drama. Devon Miles (Nick Cannon) is a talented young percussionist from Harlem who wins a music scholarship to Atlanta A &amp; T, a prestigious African-American university. For years, Atlanta A &amp; T has won awards for their show-style marching band, who combine expert musicianship (incorporating funk, R&amp;B, and jazz rhythms into the traditional marching band repertoire) with choreography, dancing cheerleaders, and roof-raising showmanship. Dr. Aaron Lee (Orlando Jones), the school's band director, gives Devon a spot in the marching band's drumline, the heart and soul of a show-style band, but discovers Devon's previous musical education hardly meets his usual standard when he learns that his new drummer can't read music. Devon soon earns a reputation as a stubborn individualist within the band, not necessarily a good thing in an ensemble where a strictly unified performance is considers the ideal. Devon's cocksure attitude and streetwise style doesn't mesh very comfortably with Sean Taylor (Leonard Roberts), a disciplined senior who resents the presence of the upstart freshman in the drumline, and things become even less harmonious when Devon begins making a play for Laila (Zoe Saldana), a beautiful girl who is also being courted by Sean. Songwriter and record producer Dallas Austin, who has worked with Boyz II Men, TLC, and Pink, served as executive producer for Drumline, helped produce the film's musical score, and contributed his own experiences as a marching band member to the screenplay(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Drumline</title>
    <desc lang="en">After decades of movies about college sports, the bands who take the field at halftime finally get their day in the sun in this musical comedy drama. Devon Miles (Nick Cannon) is a talented young percussionist from Harlem who wins a music scholarship to Atlanta A &amp; T, a prestigious African-American university. For years, Atlanta A &amp; T has won awards for their show-style marching band, who combine expert musicianship (incorporating funk, R&amp;B, and jazz rhythms into the traditional marching band repertoire) with choreography, dancing cheerleaders, and roof-raising showmanship. Dr. Aaron Lee (Orlando Jones), the school's band director, gives Devon a spot in the marching band's drumline, the heart and soul of a show-style band, but discovers Devon's previous musical education hardly meets his usual standard when he learns that his new drummer can't read music. Devon soon earns a reputation as a stubborn individualist within the band, not necessarily a good thing in an ensemble where a strictly unified performance is considers the ideal. Devon's cocksure attitude and streetwise style doesn't mesh very comfortably with Sean Taylor (Leonard Roberts), a disciplined senior who resents the presence of the upstart freshman in the drumline, and things become even less harmonious when Devon begins making a play for Laila (Zoe Saldana), a beautiful girl who is also being courted by Sean. Songwriter and record producer Dallas Austin, who has worked with Boyz II Men, TLC, and Pink, served as executive producer for Drumline, helped produce the film's musical score, and contributed his own experiences as a marching band member to the screenplay(n)</desc>

Blitz, like his onscreen alter ego, struggled with a stammer as a young man -- a disability he eventually surmounted -- which imparted him with a lifelong interest in speech and storytelling(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Jane Fonda, Felicity Huffman, and Lindsay Lohan star in director Garry Marshall's tale of a rebellious young woman who is sent to spend the summer with her grandmother when her frustrated mother fails to find a means of curbing her unruly behavior. Rachel (Lohan) is an out-of-control teen whose reckless drinking, foul mouth, and hysterical fits have become a constant source of embarrassment for her long-suffering mother, Lily (Huffman). When Rachel crashes her car, Lily determines that the only way to tame her savage daughter is to take her as far away from San Francisco as possible. Though Lily had once sworn never to return to the Idaho farm presided over by her demanding mother, Georgia (Jane Fonda), desperation has a funny way of dulling the pains of the past, and it's not long before Lily is packing Rachel in the car and setting out for potato country. Contrary to the common image of the sweet and doting grandmother, Georgia is a stern matriarch whose beliefs in the power of God and a hard day's work stand in stark contrast to the carefree lifestyle of the tempestuous Rachel. An interesting thing happens as the summer wears on, though; despite her initial efforts to disrupt the quiet Mormon community, Rachel's rage is gradually tempered as she learns the value of structure and responsibility. Later, as Rachel's protective walls begin to crumble and she begins to embrace compassion and kindness, the doors are opened for three generations of family to confront the long-buried secrets of their past and finally move forward in the healing process(n)</desc>

When the film opens, Arthur is on the threshold of an arranged marriage with simpering socialite Susan (Jill Eikenberry), whom he does not love. Everyone expects Arthur to behave himself, but nobody truly cares for his well-being, with the exception of father-figure butler Mr. Hobson (John Gielgud, who won an Oscar for his performance) and blue-collar shoplifter Linda (Liza Minnelli). Arthur would prefer to marry the lowly Linda, but his iron-willed grandmother (Geraldine Fitzgerald) threatens to pull the plug on his huge inheritance if he doesn't honor his position in life and go through with his marriage to Susan. A sequel, Arthur 2: On the Rocks, followed in 1988(n)</desc>

As is her habit, Sam ends up playing amateur detective herself, this time at a fancy health spa called Drummonds. One of the spa's customers, a woman named Debbie (Allison Smith) is found murdered, and suspicion immediately falls upon Alice (Bess Meyer), whose husband George (Scott Grimes) and Debbie were having an affair. Complicating matters is the presence of a psychic named Emily (Felicia Day) who with unbecoming eagerness offers to direct the police to the location where Debbie's body has been hidden. As a result, Emily herself is accused of the murder--and at this point Sam and her friends Cassie (Nina Siemaszko) and Philby (Clarence Williams III)--the latter a former CIA agent!--try their hand at ferreting out the real killer. Mystery Woman: Vision of Murder debuted June 5, 2005(n)</desc>

They were already known to the police for kidnapping and sexually assaulting a woman they picked up in their car in 1973, while in 1992 incriminating video footage came to light, yet they continued to fool the authorities.(n)</desc>

His walk across the medieval monarch's stamping grounds of Sherwood Forest and the Peak District reveals a hapless man stumbling from crisis to crisis who, in the end, had no choice but to sign away some of his power. In the midst of what are now cultivated fields, Tony finds the scant remains of Laxton Castle, once the control centre where strict `forest law' was administered and where taxes and fines flooded into the royal coffers. Later, in Sherwood, he explores how the myth of Robin Hood has helped to skew the public's image of King John.(n)</desc>

One of Carnby's assignments leads him to discover the secrets of the Abskani, an ancient tribe that worshiped demonic forces which gave them incredible powers. Carnby's findings suggest that the Abskani are poised to return to take over the world, and only one person has the knowledge to stop them -- archeologist Aline Cedrac (Tara Reid), who happens to be Carnby's former girlfriend. But Carnby's psyche has been tainted by his encounter with the Abskani demons, and he must now fight against their attempts to take over his mind as well as their attempts to conquer the Earth.

    <desc lang="en">A horror semi-parody targeted at the young adult market that ravenously gobbles up horror books like R.L. Stine's Goosebumps series, this made-for-TV vampire tale stars Chauncey Leopardi as Zach, a teenage rebel with a flair for telling ghost stories, who stumbles on an underground cabal of vampires when he takes a fateful ride on a New York subway. The vampire's leader, Valentine (Ron Silver), proposes a deal to young Zach, offering him safe passage to the world above, thus enabling the trapped vampire -- who can only mingle with humanity through the willing assistance of an innocent youth -- to reach the surface as well. Our young hero balks at this idea and escapes to the surface with a wild story for his skeptical pals, who shun him until one of their number is kidnapped by the undead subway dwellers in exchange for Zach's cooperation. Though atmospherically photographed, this low-budget production is a bit too corny to provide either laughs or chills, and it suffers further from lethargic pacing(n)</desc>

College football coach Tom Baker (Steve Martin) and his wife, author Kate Baker (Bonnie Hunt), have decided its time they took their sizable brood of 12 children on a summer vacation, and so they pack up the cars and take the kids to Lake Winnetka for some camping. Not all the kids are happy about this, but the one who is really annoyed turns out to be Tom, who discovers his old rival Jimmy Murtaugh (Eugene Levy) is also staying near the lake. Jimmy and his trophy wife, Sarina (Carmen Electra), also have a large family of eight children, and Jimmy and Tom seem intent upon one-upping each other at every opportunity. As the tensions mount, the Baker family and the Murtaugh clan face off in a not-so-good-natured series of family games to determine which of the parents have the greater bragging rights. In addition to Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt, the actors playing the 12 Baker children from the 2003 film return for Cheaper by the Dozen 2, including Hilary Duff, Piper Perabo, Tom Welling, and Kevin Schmidt(n)</desc>

College football coach Tom Baker (Steve Martin) and his wife, author Kate Baker (Bonnie Hunt), have decided its time they took their sizable brood of 12 children on a summer vacation, and so they pack up the cars and take the kids to Lake Winnetka for some camping. Not all the kids are happy about this, but the one who is really annoyed turns out to be Tom, who discovers his old rival Jimmy Murtaugh (Eugene Levy) is also staying near the lake. Jimmy and his trophy wife, Sarina (Carmen Electra), also have a large family of eight children, and Jimmy and Tom seem intent upon one-upping each other at every opportunity. As the tensions mount, the Baker family and the Murtaugh clan face off in a not-so-good-natured series of family games to determine which of the parents have the greater bragging rights. In addition to Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt, the actors playing the 12 Baker children from the 2003 film return for Cheaper by the Dozen 2, including Hilary Duff, Piper Perabo, Tom Welling, and Kevin Schmidt(n)</desc>

Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is hopelessly trapped in Davy Jones' locker after a harrowing encounter with the dreaded Kracken, and now Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) must align themselves with the nefarious Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) if they hold out any hope of saving their old friend from a fate worse than death. The East India Trading Company and its fearsome leader, Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), have taken control of the ghostly Flying Dutchman and its captain, Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), and now the baleful Admiral Norrington (Jack Davenport) has taken the helm in a relentless bid to destroy every pirate ship in his path and bring the Age of Piracy to a violent close. Meanwhile, Will, Elizabeth, and Captain Barbossa navigate treacherous waters and face bitter betrayal as they set sail to gather the only army that can stand up to Beckett -- The Nine Lords of the Brethren Court. But Captain Jack Sparrow is one of the lords, and as long as he's stuck in Davy Jones' locker, Beckett and his nefarious armada are sure to emerge victorious. There's still hope, however, if the heroic team that includes Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris), Pintel (Lee Arenberg), and Ragetti (Mackenzie Crook) can reach exotic Singapore and convince vulpine pirate Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat) to provide them with charts and a ship.

    <title lang="en">The Emperor's Club</title>
    <desc lang="en">A dedicated teacher learns some important lessons about himself years after he retired from the classroom in this drama. William Hundert (Kevin Kline) is an instructor at St. Benedict's School for Boys, an exclusive private academy on the East Coast where Hundert drills his charges on the moral lessons to be learned through the study of Greek and Roman philosophers. Hundert is fond of telling his students, "A man's character is his fate," and he strives to impress upon them the importance of the ordered and examined life. In 1976, however, Hundert finds himself with an especially challenging group of students -- party-minded Fred Masoudi (Jesse Eisenberg) , introverted Martin Blythe (Paul Dano), bright but mischievous Deepak Mehta (Rishi Mehta), and most notably, openly rebellious Sedgewick Bell (Emile Hirsch). The son of a powerful politician, Bell pointedly runs against the current of Hundert's example, questioning the importance of the material, flouting the school's rules, talking out of turn in class, and devoting as much time to his interest in girls as in his studies. However, Hundert sees the possibility of great things in Bell, and encourages him to take part in the school's annual academic competition for the title of Mr. Julius Caesar. Hundert even goes so far as to bend the rules in scoring to favor Bell in the early stages of the contest, but his faith is betrayed when Bell is discovered cheating during the contest finals. Years later, Hundert is reunited with his students, where they learn the years have taught them all a great deal about their virtues and weaknesses. The Emperor's Club also features Harris Yulin, Rob Morrow, and Edward Herrmann(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The many emotional scars left by South Africa's history of institutionalized racism come under the microscope in this drama. As South Africa comes to terms with the legacy of apartheid, their government has created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, in which the perpetrators of racial violence and injustice must come face to face with their victims if they are to be forgiven for their crimes. Langston Whitfield (Samuel L. Jackson) is an African-American journalist who is assigned to cover these hearings by The Washington Post; Whitfield doubts the efficacy of this process, and sets out to interview Col. De Jager (Brendan Gleeson), a notorious former officer of the South African police who was famous for his violence against blacks in order to put this method to the test. While in South Africa, Whitfield meets Anna Malan (Juliette Binoche), an Afrikaner poet who is covering the hearing for a radio station and is both appalled and disturbed by the details of the violence inflicted against her countrymen. After striking up a friendship, Whitfield and Malan become romantically involved as they try to come to terms with their feelings about what they've learned. Also screened under the title Country of My Skull, In My Country was adapted from a book by South African author Antjie Krog(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Nicholas Hytner (The Crucible) directed this Wendy Wasserstein screenplay, adapted from Stephen McCauley's novel, about the romantic mismatch of a gay man and a young pregnant woman. When literary agent Sidney Miller (Alan Alda) and his wife Constance (Allison Janney) have a dinner party, Constance's social-worker stepsister Nina Borowski (Jennifer Aniston) attends without her lawyer boyfriend Vince McBride (John Pankow). Also present are gay schoolteacher George Hanson (Paul Rudd) and his lover, Dr. Robert Joley (Tim Daly). George learns from Nina that he's being dumped by Robert, a scene ensues, and Nina then invites George to stay in the spare room of her Brooklyn apartment. Nina still has sex with boyfriend Vince, but during late-night talks, she begins to bond with her gay roommate. Nina and George take dance lessons at the local senior citizen's community center, and Gershwin's "You Were Meant for Me" sets the tone for romance as the two become soul mates. Unfortunately, shortly after their love blooms, Nina learns she's pregnant by Vince, who is no longer the object of her affections. Instead of telling the unwanted Vince right away, Nina asks George to join her in raising the child. George stays on, but in the months that follow, he also begins to see men again. Robert takes him along to a Connecticut conference where drama critic Rodney Fraser (Nigel Hawthorne) has Paul James (Amo Gulinello) in tow. George and Paul have an instant attraction, and this prompts everyone involved to reassess their emotional commitments(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Nicole Beharie, Tim Blake Nelson, Will Patton, and Xzibit headline this fact-based drama about an innocent Texas mother caught up in a high-profile drug raid, and unjustly accused due to the uncorroborated testimony of a single informant. Dee Roberts (Beharie) is a young single mother of four living in a small Texas town. Arrested during a drug raid and accused of a crime she didn't commit, Dee goes against the wishes of her mother, Alma (Alfre Woodard), and rejects the plea-bargain that would free her from jail, but brand her as a felon for life. As word begins to spread that similar incidents are occurring in poor communities all across the country, Dee realizes that there are more mothers out there like her, and decides to take a stand against powerful district attorney Calvin Beckett (Michael O'Keefe). Now, despite being well aware of District Attorney Beckett's fierce reputation, Dee enlists the aid of ACLU attorney David Cohen (Nelson) and former narcotics officer Sam Conroy (Patton) in overcoming the seemingly insurmountable obstacles that, if not navigated with the greatest of caution, now threaten to destroy her life. With the custody of her children on the line, one brave mother wages a valiant battle to strike at the very heart of the corrupt Texas justice system(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Are you ready for a new kind of superhero -- a thirty-something virgin in long underwear? Darryl Walker (Damon Wayans) is a bright but socially inept man with a gift for inventing things but little skill for functioning in the real world. His brother Kevin (David Alan Grier) works on a low-class tabloid news show featuring beautiful anchorwoman Kimberley Jonz (Robin Givens), whom he secretly loves. The Walkers live in Metro City, Illinois, a city that's been hit with a massive crime wave after the mayor is kidnapped by gangsters. After his grandmother is killed, Darryl builds a collection of crime-fighting robots from household junk, invents bullet-proof long underwear (made from his grandmother's old housecoat), and becomes Metro City's newest crime fighter, Blankman. Blankman's escapades put fear into the heart of mob boss Michael Minelli (Jon Polito), and when Kevin turns out to have an inside track on Blankman's activities, it brings him closer to Kimberley. But how long can a superhero with no superpowers last against the forces of organized crime? Damon Wayans wrote the original story for Blankman as well as co-writing the screenplay and playing the title role, which was based in part on his "Handi-Man" character from the TV comedy series In Living Color(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Live-action filmmaking mixes with imaginative animation in director Michael Landon Jr.'s feature adaptation of author Margery Williams' beloved children's book. An energetic child with a vivid imagination, Toby Morgan (Matthew Harbour) lives with his father (Kevin Jubinville), a successful businessman who seemed to shut down emotionally following the death of Toby's mother. When Toby is sent to spend the Christmas holidays with his loving but stern grandmother (Una Kay), he wanders through the lonely house until he eventually discovers the "magic attic" that was once his father's childhood playroom. There, Toby is surprised to find that his mother left him a stuffed velveteen rabbit -- her final gift to her beloved son. Hugging the rabbit close as he starts to cry, the grieving boy watches in wonder as his tears magically bring the toy to life. Before long, Toby is frolicking in the enchanted attic with a whole new group of friends, including the impetuous Horse (voiced by Tom Skerritt) and the wise but skittish Swan (voice of Ellen Burstyn). Toby's one wish is to spend Christmas with his father, and Rabbit's one wish is to someday hop across the fields as a real rabbit. Later, when Toby falls seriously ill, the courageous Rabbit helps him to win over his grandmother and make a full recovery. When Toby's father returns in time for Christmas, the power of the young child's love grants the Velveteen Rabbit its one true wish(n)</desc>

Unfortunately, little Fievel ends up trapped in a bottle and landing in New York City alone. At first the city's bustling streets are terrifying to the tiny mouse. Not all his fellow rodents are friendly, and the Big Apple cats are definitely dangers to be avoided. Still, he is determined to find his family. Things perk up a bit though when Fievel becomes friends with Tiger, the vegetarian cat. One song from the film, "Somewhere out There" was a chart-topping hit and earned an Oscar nomination(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Millions</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Danny Boyle revisits a theme from his Shallow Grave and Trainspotting days -- greed -- but focuses on a much younger protagonist with this comedy drama. Millions opens with recent widower Ronnie (James Nesbitt) moving his two precocious pre-pubescent sons to the suburbs. Missing his mother and the comforts of his old neighborhood, the young Damian (Alex Etel) builds a cardboard-box fort on the outskirts of the suburb, where one day his placid introvert existence is literally crushed by a giant gym bag full of thousands of pounds' worth of cash. Less concerned with the origin of the money than with how to spend it, Damian and his older brother, Anthony (Lewis McGibbon), decide to keep it a secret from their father, which becomes an increasingly tricky proposition as the days pass. His conscience getting in the way of his spending, Damian debates the ethics of his ill-gotten gains with a handful of imaginary saints, and begins to try to spend his cash a little more altruistically. But his charitable deeds inadvertently attract the attention of a mysterious, threatening man who's desperate to get his hands on the money. Marking a distinct change of pace for Boyle after the horror film 28 Days Later, Millions world-premiered at the 2004 Toronto Film Festival(n)</desc>

Well, probably not, but seeing one of their killers walk free after striking a bargain with the prosecuting lawer wouldn't make things any easier. And so it is for Clyde Shelton. But the experience doesn't destroy him; instead it eats away at him for a decade, until he snaps and takes sadistic revenge on the freed murderer. And then, even after he himself has been jailed, he embarks on a deadly campaign against everyone else connected with the case - including the police and legal representatives. Also starring Jamie Foxx, Leslie Bibb and Colm Meaney(n)</desc>
