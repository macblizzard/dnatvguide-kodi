    <title lang="en">Zorba the Greek</title>
    <desc lang="en">If ever there was a role that Anthony Quinn was born to play, it was the lusty, life-affirming title character in Zorba the Greek. The scene is the isle of Crete, where English writer Alan Bates arrives in the hopes of realigning his own values and outlook on life. He is "adopted" by the flamboyant Zorba, who determines to educate Bates in the ways of the world-or, to be more precise, Zorba's world. Along the way, Bates is introduced to widow Irene Papas, the unrequited love object of everyone on the island, who comes to a tragic end when she is accused of adultery. The writer is also a spectator to the equally benighted romance between Zorba and venerable courtesan Lila Kedrova. Other disasters follow, but Zorba is able to convince Bates that failure is an inescapable part of life, and that only by constantly tasting defeat can one truly enjoy life's victories. Based on the novel by Nikos Kazantzakis, Zorba the Greek earned Oscars for actress Lila Kedrova, cinematographer Walter Lassally and art director Vassilis Fotopoulos(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">I Am Legend</title>
    <desc lang="en">Adapted from acclaimed author Richard Matheson's influential novelette of the same name, Constantine director Francis Lawrence's I Am Legend follows the last man on Earth as he struggles to survive while fending off the infected survivors of a devastating vampiric plague. A brilliant scientist who raced to discover a cure for the man-made virus as humanity came crumbling down all around him, Robert Neville (Will Smith) was inexplicably immune to the highly contagious superbug. Now the entire population of New York City -- and perhaps the world -- has been transformed into carnivorous bloodsuckers that fear the light and live solely to spread their contagion to any remaining living creature that crosses their path. It's been three years since civilization came to an end, and the loneliness has taken a devastating toll on Neville. By day he scours the city for food and supplies while sending out desperate radio messages in hopes that someone might respond, and by night he attempts to find a way to reverse the effects of the virus by experimenting with his own blood. But time is running out for Neville as the legions of infected watch his every move from the safety of the shadows, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. They, too, long to learn the secret that lurks in Neville's blood, though they will have to take caution while attempting to procure it because Neville will sooner die attempting to slay every last one of them than willingly giving up a single drop. Previously adapted for the screen in the 1964 Vincent Price frightener The Last Man on Earth and the 1971 Charlton Heston action film The Omega Man, Matheson's novelette also served as the inspiration for George A. Romero's groundbreaking zombie classic Night of the Living Dead(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May attempt to improve the ambulance, with the presenters all going their own separate ways to enhance one area they think could do with an overhaul. James focuses on passenger comfort, Richard tries to shorten response times by getting other drivers out of the way more effectively, an issue Jeremy tackles with the invention of what he calls the `sports ambulance'. Their three very different creations are then put to the test with a series of severe and often messy challenges. Plus, Formula One driver Daniel Ricciardo is the Star in the Reasonably Priced Car.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">By late summer 1944, the Allied forces in Europe were thrusting toward the German border, but supply problems brought the advance to a halt, while Soviet leader Josef Stalin had halted his main push to Berlin while he laid the basis for a Communist empire. Hitler decided to stake his last reserves on a major counter-offensive in the Ardennes region of Belgium, leading to what became known as the Battle of the Bulge. Meanwhile, Soviet troops discovered the first death camps and evidence emerged of the Nazi programme to exterminate the Jewish people.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Cowboy Bebop: The Movie</title>
    <desc lang="en">The popular animé series Cowboy Bebop gets its own feature-length film with the aptly named Cowboy Bebop: The Movie. Set in the late 21st century, it jumps into the series' story line just prior to its conclusion, with the bounty hunting crew of the interstellar craft Bebop chasing a hacker aboard a tanker into a major city on Mars. As crew member Faye Valentine closes in on the tanker, she witnesses its catastrophic explosion, which soon appears to be a viral terrorist attack as the death toll continues to mount in the days following. Furthermore, Faye caught a glimpse of the person responsible for the blast and is thus the only surviving witness of the crime. After the government puts out a large bounty for the perpetrator's capture, the Bebop gang -- slacker Spike Spiegel, former policeman Jet Black, and hacker girl genius Edward -- begin their own hunt for the mass murderer, who is eventually revealed to be one Vincent Volaju. Vincent, it turns out, was the lone survivor of a governmental medical test and now seeks revenge by unleashing the same microscopic robotic virus used in the tanker explosion on the unsuspecting city. The Bebop crew must scramble to prevent Vincent from carrying out his plan, as well as try to locate an anti-virus to counterattack the effects of Vincent's virus. Released in both dubbed and subtitled cuts in the United States in 2003, Cowboy Bebop - The Movie premiered in Japan in 2001(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">North Country</title>
    <desc lang="en">A fictionalized account of one of America's most groundbreaking sexual harassment lawsuits comes to the screen in this hard-hitting drama. In the late '80s, Josey Aimes (Charlize Theron) fled her abusive husband, and needed to find a way to support her two children. Aimes returned to her hometown in Minnesota and followed the lead of her old friend Glory (Frances McDormand), who had bucked tradition and found a job in the iron mines that had long provided employment for much of the community. Aimes found honest labor and a living wage working the mines, but she also discovered she was working with men who were uncomfortable working with women (whose right to work in the mines had been mandated by law almost 15 years prior), and didn't care to show them much respect. However, as Aimes found herself the growing target of sexist jokes and abhorrent behavior, she found that many of her female co-workers were reluctant to stand beside her, afraid of losing a good-paying job at a time when they were increasingly hard to find. But as a personal crisis became a public war of words, Aimes became the center of a nationwide controversy when she attempted to file a class action sexual harassment suit against the mine owners, which put her and her family in a position of scrutiny beyond her worst expectations. North Country also stars Sean Bean, Sissy Spacek, and Woody Harrelson(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">JJ Abram's sci-fi adventure prequel, starring Chris Pine and Zacchary Quinto, uses the twin devices of a parallel timeline and time travel to boldly move the franchise in a new direction. In order to foil a Romulan attack, George Kirk sacrifices himself, having first arranged for an escape pod to take his pregnant wife to safety. Around 20 years later, the young tearaway James T Kirk is encouraged to join the Starfleet Academy by Captain Pike. At the same time, an equally youthful Spock throws in his lot with humankind and enlists with Starfleet, having had enough of the Vulcan racism directed at him due to his half-human parentage. The two recruits instantly clash. But they must overcome their differences if they are to survive a vengeful visitor from the future, who's determined to make Spock pay for his part in an atrocity that's yet to be committed... Also starring Eric Bana, Karl Urban, Simon Pegg and Winona Ryder(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Picking up precisely where its hit predecessor left off, Sony Pictures Animation's Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 finds Flint Lockwood (voice of Bill Hader) invited to join the Live Corp Company, and use his gift for invention for the good of mankind. Just as young Flint prepares to go to work for his hero Chester V (voice of Will Forte), however, the young genius learns that his water-to-food machine is not only still functional, but it's also started cross-breeding animals with food. Now, in order to prevent a growing army of "foodimals" from escaping isolation on an island and wreaking havoc on the mainland, Flint and his loyal group of friends will have to do battle with such delicious, but deadly, hybrids as the ferocious tacodiles, slithering apple pie-thons, and vine-swinging shrimpanzees. Saving the world from these rampaging monstrosities won't be easy, but if anyone is up to the task, it's Flint and company. Cody Cameron and Kris Pearn takes the reins for this sequel also featuring vocal contributions by Anna Faris, James Caan, Kristen Schaal, Terry Crews, Andy Samberg, Neil Patrick Harris, and Benjamin Bratt(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A misfit macaw named Blu (voice of Jesse Eisenberg) heads to Rio de Janeiro, embarks on a magnificent journey, and makes some loyal new friends in this animated adventure for the entire family. Domesticated from the time he was just a hatchling, Blu traded a life in the clouds for a contented existence in Moose Lake with his doting owner, Linda (Leslie Mann). They live under the impression that Blu is the last of his kind, but upon receiving word that a female macaw named Jewel (Anne Hathaway) has been discovered in Rio de Janeiro, Linda and Blu set their sights on South America on a mission to replenish the species. Shortly after their arrival in the Brazilian capitol, however, the two rare birds fall victim to a gang of greedy animal smugglers intent on making a mint by selling Blu and Jewel to the highest bidder. But the headstrong Jewel isn't about to be locked in a cage and put on display, so when the opportunity arises she stages a daring escape with the help of some wisecracking local birds, and takes her new friend Blu along for the ride. With the bumbling birdnappers fast closing in, Blu realizes that his only hope for making a clean getaway and reuniting with Linda is to finally summon the courage he needs to take flight. Rio also features the voices of Tracy Morgan, Jamie Foxx, George Lopez, and will.i.am(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Baby Mama</title>
    <desc lang="en">Former Saturday Night Live "Weekend Update" co-anchors Tina Fey and Amy Poehler co-star in this baby-fever comedy about a single, career-oriented woman who previously put parenthood on hold, and is forced to hire a surrogate mother when she discovers there is only a one-in-a-million chance that she will be able to get pregnant. Kate Holbrook (Fey) is a 37-year-old business executive who has always put her professional life before her personal life, but these days her biological clock is ticking louder than ever before. As with everything else she has accomplished in life, Kate is determined to have a child on her own terms. Unfortunately for Kate, the chance of her ever becoming pregnant is slim to none. Undaunted, a willful Kate drafts South Philly working-class girl Angie Ostrowiski (Poehler) -- a woman who may just be her polar opposite -- to be a surrogate mother. Subsequently informed by the head of the surrogacy center (Sigourney Weaver) that her surrogate is indeed pregnant, the excited mother-to-be soon purchases every child-rearing book she can find and excitedly begins the nesting process. But life hasn't quit throwing Kate curveballs just yet, because when a pregnant Angie shows up on her doorstep with no place to live, the woman who once thrived on order finds her life descending into chaos. Now, as Kate attempts to transform Angie into the ideal expectant mother, this odd couple will discover that families aren't always biological, but occasionally formed through friendship as well. Writer Michael McCullers, who authored the screenplays for Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and Undercover Brother in addition to working on Saturday Night Live, makes his feature directorial debut with a self-penned screenplay(n)</desc>

After running a stop sign in a small town just off the New Jersey turnpike, Chris and his friends are pulled over and arrested by a motorcycle cop named Denis (John Candy). The travellers are brought before J.P. (Aykroyd), the ancient and vindictive Justice of the Peace in the very strange village of Valkevania, where minor traffic offenses are usually punished by torture or death. While Fausto and Renalda are able to escape, Chris and Diane find themselves trapped in a bizarre underground maze in which fellow tourists like themselves must fight for their lives. Keep an eye peeled for the screen debut of Tupac Shakur, who appears as a member of the rap group Digital Underground(n)</desc>

While all three are successful in their careers -- Kate has been named headmistress of an upscale private school, Molly is a doctor, and Janine's a police detective -- they've been striking out in the dating scene, and they get together on a regular basis to compare notes and drown their sorrows in cocktails and chocolate. One day, while attending the funeral of a colleague, Kate makes the acquaintance of Jed (Kenny Doughty), a good-looking man who remembers Kate as one of his teachers when he attended the school years ago. Despite the decade-and-a-half gap in their ages, there's a strong mutual attraction between Kate and Jed, and before the day is over the two are enjoying an affair. Molly and Janine are at once amused and appalled at Kate for dating a younger man, and while she tells them it's a short-lived fling that means little to either party, neither Kate nor Jed wants to walk away from their relationship; before long Kate and Jed decide they've fallen in love and plan to get married. The harder Molly and Janine try to convince Kate that she's making a mistake, the more Kate is determined to tie the knot with Jed, and eventually Molly and Janine decide to take drastic measures -- Molly hatches a plan to seduce Jed, while Janine captures their tryst on videotape(n)</desc>

Dr Theodor Morell's records, which have been locked away since 1945, are a unique source of information. They reveal that, far from being a picture of robust health, the Fuehrer was a nervy hypochondriac, and chart in great detail his descent into illness and drug dependency.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">World Without Men. Welcome to Lee Arrendale State Prison, Georgias largest facility for women. From minor offenders to murderers, almost 1600 offenders make their home here, some for a few weeks … some for the rest of their lives. Here, society takes on a life of its own, with drugs, hustles and illegal sexual relationships making up much of the world behind bars. In this episode, we meet inmates all trying to find the right way to do their time in the extreme world of prison. This episode looks at four very different inmates and how their time has affected their behavior, their senses of self, and their future: from a prison stud, to a changed lifer, to a manipulator of the system. With each story, we see that learning to do time is an ongoing process; its a matter of knowing who you are, and in the extremes of prison life, who you are willing to become(n)</desc>

She was in the deadly jaws of a massive Great White shark. With deep gashes to her face and her arm almost completely severed, her friends raced to action but will they be able to save her life? Andrew was enjoying a trip to the idyllic Fraser Island with his wife when he was bitten by a snake. Andrew was sure it was a non-venomous snake and wanted to ignore it but his wife insisted they get help. What he didnt know was that the deadly venom of a Brown Snake was cursing through his veins and could very quickly stop his blood from clogging and send his organs into failure ? Young Ryan was playing outdoors when he was bitten by a Jumping Jack Ant. Within seconds, his face began to swell and his airways closed up. His mother and father rushed him to the hospital but didnt recognize the signs of anaphylactic shock(n)</desc>

Zac was excited for a morning surfing with his older brother and mate at a remote surf break in Western Australia. It was a gray, overcast day, but the last thing on the young surfers mind was sharks until one took off his leg in a single bite. In far north Queensland, active Tom went on a pig hunting trip with his two dogs when the roles were reversed and they became the hunted... by a deadly saltwater crocodile. Finally, Duncans idyllic lifestyle living on a boat all changed when he was bitten by what he thought was a harmless mosquito. A simple mosquito bite grew into a large ulcer on his arm, and then spread to multiple sites on his body. It took months before doctors diagnosed the relentless flesh-eating bacteria as the Mycobacterium ulcerans, but by then he was at risk of losing his arm(n)</desc>

With no thought for her own safety, she leapt onto its back only to be attacked herself as the croc swung around and grabbed her by the arm. Six-year-old Madison was riding her bike in suburban Perth with her grandmother when she was swooped by an Australian magpie. As she tried to escape, the bird kept chasing and attacking her. It swooped down and pecked at her eye until it popped. Ross River Fever is a mosquito borne virus that can cause a debilitating illness.

    <title lang="hr">Crvena rijeka</title>
    <title lang="xx">Red Water</title>
    <desc lang="hr">Da nesreća nikad ne dolazi sama, kao i da se strah javlja tamo gdje ga najmanje očekujemo, pokazuje nam ovaj zanimljivi televizijski triler o ljudima koji su spremni na sve kako bi si osigurali bolju budućnost. Budu li je uopće doživjeli. Suočen s bankrotom, kapetan ribarskog broda iz Louisiane John Sanders (Lou Diamond Phillips) se uz pomoć vjernog pomoćnika Emeryja Broussarda (Rob Boltin) odlučuje na povratak na njihov prvotni posao, potragu i crpljenje podvodnog ulja. Sandersova bivša supruga Kelli (Kristy Swanson) ponudi im velik novac za pomoć pri traženju ogromnog nalazišta pod rijekom Atchafalaya. Istovremeno, policijski načelnik Dale Landry (Dennis Haskins) istražuje dojave očevidaca o opasnom morskom psu koji sije smrt i strah po istoj rijeci, kao i pojavu opasnih kriminalaca predvođenih nemilosrdnim Iceom (Coolio) koji traži davno skriveni novac. Različiti planovi svih tih skupina cijelo će se vrijeme ispreplitati, do krvave završnice. "Crvena rijeka" iznimno je uzbudljiv triler redatelja Charlesa Roberta Carnera, koji je u žanrovsku matricu spretno uklopio i tragove drugih filmskih vrsta, kao što su horor o zastrašujućem prirodnom neprijatelju i avanturistički film potrage, ali i obiteljska drama, koja se očituje u odnosu kapetana Sandersa i njegove bivše supruge. Uz odličnog Loua Diamonda Phillipsa ("La Bamba") u glavnoj ulozi, ekipu upotpunjuje cijeli niz poznatih filmskih i televizijskih lica, ali najdojmljiviji nastup je ostvario glazbenik, slavni reper Coolio(n)</desc>

Jamie Peacock and Kylie Leuluai have both now retired, while captain Kevin Sinfield has jumped codes to join Yorkshire Carnegie in rugby union. Brian McDermott's side also made a less-than-ideal start to the defence of their Super League crown, losing their opening game against Warrington Wolves 12-10 on this ground.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Straight Story</title>
    <desc lang="en">David Lynch's Oscar-nominated FilmFour-funded film, based on a true story, stars the late Richard Farnsworth as Alvin Straight. Alvin learns his brother is dying and wants to see him one more time. But he can't afford the air fare and he doesn't have a car. What he has is a tractor-mower that he decides to drive the 300 miles to Wisconsin. The film simply documents his painfully slow progress, the people he meets and the adventures he has but does so with loving care, slowly bringing out Alvin's character but showing along the way how he too brings out the best in those he meets. Unique, superlative filmmaking, stunningly shot by Freddie Francis(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Tyler Perry's Meet the Browns</title>
    <desc lang="en">Prolific playwright Tyler Perry adapts his popular stage play of the same name in this family-oriented comedy concerning a desperate mother who connects with the family she never knew. Brenda is a single Chicago mother of three who has been struggling for years to keep her kids off of the streets. Suddenly let go from her job with no warning to speak of, the eternally optimistic mother begins to experience a suffocating sense of hopelessness for the very first time in her life. When Brenda receives a death notice claiming that the father she has never met has passed away, she quickly gathers up the kids and sets out for Georgia to attend the funeral. Upon arriving in the Deep South, the once fretful mother is pleasantly surprised to discover that there is a whole side of the family she never knew existed. A crass but good-natured clan that welcomes Brenda and her children with open arms, the Browns' lazy summer afternoons and frequent trips to the county fair offer a much-needed contrast to the stress of surviving in inner city Chicago. Writer/director/actor Perry reprises his role as indomitable, law-breaking grandmother Madea in a comedy that proves sometimes second chances come when you least expect it(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Straight Story</title>
    <desc lang="en">David Lynch's Oscar-nominated FilmFour-funded film, based on a true story, stars the late Richard Farnsworth as Alvin Straight. Alvin learns his brother is dying and wants to see him one more time. But he can't afford the air fare and he doesn't have a car. What he has is a tractor-mower that he decides to drive the 300 miles to Wisconsin. The film simply documents his painfully slow progress, the people he meets and the adventures he has but does so with loving care, slowly bringing out Alvin's character but showing along the way how he too brings out the best in those he meets. Unique, superlative filmmaking, stunningly shot by Freddie Francis(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Tyler Perry's Meet the Browns</title>
    <desc lang="en">Prolific playwright Tyler Perry adapts his popular stage play of the same name in this family-oriented comedy concerning a desperate mother who connects with the family she never knew. Brenda is a single Chicago mother of three who has been struggling for years to keep her kids off of the streets. Suddenly let go from her job with no warning to speak of, the eternally optimistic mother begins to experience a suffocating sense of hopelessness for the very first time in her life. When Brenda receives a death notice claiming that the father she has never met has passed away, she quickly gathers up the kids and sets out for Georgia to attend the funeral. Upon arriving in the Deep South, the once fretful mother is pleasantly surprised to discover that there is a whole side of the family she never knew existed. A crass but good-natured clan that welcomes Brenda and her children with open arms, the Browns' lazy summer afternoons and frequent trips to the county fair offer a much-needed contrast to the stress of surviving in inner city Chicago. Writer/director/actor Perry reprises his role as indomitable, law-breaking grandmother Madea in a comedy that proves sometimes second chances come when you least expect it(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Mighty Joe Young</title>
    <desc lang="en">Ron Underwood's remake of the 1949 cult classic stars Charlize Theron as Jill Young, who runs a game reserve in Africa that is home to Mighty Joe Young, a paranormally large gorilla. But both of them are in danger from big game hunter Strasser, who was also responsible for orphaning Jill and Joe. When Gregg O'Hara, a Californian zoologist, offers them both a haven in his reserve in America, Jill accepts but Strasser won't be thwarted and pursues Joe. And when Joe escapes and starts running amok in Hollywood, it seems the hunter's moment may have come... Since the film is produced by Disney, it is heart-warming throughout, but fans of special effects will enjoy the realisation of Joe, the work of expert Rick Baker, who also worked on King Kong (1976) and Gorillas in the Mist(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A young couple (Alexie Gilmore, Bryce Johnson) venture into Six Rivers National Forest in Northern California to search for Bigfoot, and make a terrifying discovery in this found-footage horror film from writer-director Bobcat Goldthwait. Convinced that he will capture video evidence of Sasquatch at the same place where the legendary Patterson-Gimlin film was shot, Jim (Bryce Johnson) persuades his skeptical girlfriend Kelly (Alexie Gilmore) to join him on a cryptozoological excursion into the deep woods. Before Jim and Kelly set out on their mission, however, they first visit Willow Creek -- a town that thrives on the Bigfoot phenomenon -- to interview the locals about the legend. There, the couple are repeatedly warned that the forest can be a dangerous place at night -- warnings that go unheeded by Jim as he single-mindedly focuses on making the journey he's dreamt about for years. Later, in the darkened woods, however, the once-carefree couple experience paralyzing fear when someone -- or something -- begins rooting around their campsite, and uttering inhuman howls. Uncertain if they've actually survived an encounter with Bigfoot or simply fallen victim to a cruel prank by the locals, Jim and Kelly agree to pack their bags, and return to civilization at sunrise. But this is just the beginning of a nightmare that neither of them may ever awaken from(n)</desc>

But as production on Le Mans got underway, the driven star would be forced to contend not only with the sudden departure of the film's original director, John Sturgis, but his own failing marriage, the threat of bankruptcy, and the fear of learning that he had been targeted for death by one of the most notorious serial killers of the 20th Century as well(n)</desc>

Decades after a nuclear war, a lone man calling himself Eli trudges through the dilapidated cities and scorched wilderness of America, carrying his copy of the Bible, a sacred book that provides 'contentment for the weak-minded'. On an odyssey to bring the text to a sacred place, Eli brings God's wrath down on the robbers, murderers and rapists who lie in wait along the highways. Driven by faith and divine calling, Eli's endeavour becomes harder when he meets the power-hungry Carnegie, who tutors an army of psychopathic rogues and gunmen in a small town. Hoping to steal the book he believes is his last chance to rule what is left of humanity, Carnegie sets out to catch Eli, while Carnegie's step-daughter also follows Eli on his quest. As Carnegie and his henchmen hunt Eli down, they soon discover what a powerful and fearsome adversary he really is(n)</desc>

On an odyssey to bring the text to a sacred place, Eli brings God's wrath down on the robbers, murderers and rapists who lie in wait along the highways. Driven by faith and divine calling, Eli's endeavour becomes harder when he meets the power-hungry Carnegie, who tutors an army of psychopathic rogues and gunmen in a small town. Hoping to steal the book he believes is his last chance to rule what is left of humanity, Carnegie sets out to catch Eli, while Carnegie's step-daughter also follows Eli on his quest. As Carnegie and his henchmen hunt Eli down, they soon discover what a powerful and fearsome adversary he really is(n)</desc>

Over time, she gathers the courage to tell her husband all of the things she had remained silent about during their 10 years of marriage. Throughout the course of these missives, she speaks frankly of the disappointments, sorrows, and sacrifices that have made her life so difficult throughout the previous decade. Only weeks later, when the isolated wife enters into a relationship with a young soldier, does she begin to reveal the woman who she had kept locked up deep inside ever since the day she was married(n)</desc>

Burroughs. The year is 1944. Ginsberg (Radcliffe) is a young student at Columbia University when he falls hopelessly under the spell of charismatic classmate Carr (Dane DeHaan). Alongside Carr, Ginsberg manages to strike up friendships with aspiring writers William S. Burroughs (Ben Foster) and Jack Kerouac (Jack Huston) that would cast conformity to the wind, and serve as the foundation of the Beat movement. Meanwhile, an older outsider named David Kammerer falls deeply and madly in love with the impossibly cool Carr. Later, when Kammerer dies under mysterious circumstances, police arrest Kerouac, Burroughs, and Carr as potential suspects, paving the way for an investigation that would have a major impact on the lives of the three emerging artists.

    <desc lang="en">Cult director Larry Cohen (It's Alive) directed this violent blaxploitation film. Nasty racist John McKinney cripples a black shoeshine boy, who grows up to be Tommy Gibbs (Fred Williamson), the Godfather of Harlem. The crimelord now has his tormentor McKinney (Art Lund) in his pocket, based on the cop's mob ties. Tommy's traitorous girlfriend Helen (Gloria Hendry) hands over the evidence, and McKinney moves in for the kill. But he may have underestimated the violent Tommy, who makes him shine his shoes in blackface while singing "Mammy." Rick Baker provided makeup effects, and James Brown did the music for this bloody oddity, followed the same year by Hell Up in Harlem. Cohen and Williamson got together 23 years later for an interesting (if unsuccessful) attempt at reviving the genre, Original Gangstas(n)</desc>

DJ Harvard (voice of Mitchel Musso) lives directly across the street from a most unusual house. A malevolent entity that longs to feed on the energy of the living, the once peaceful house that looms ominously outside of DJ's bedroom window would like nothing more than the chance to feast on the children of the neighborhood. As Halloween begins to draw near and the children of the neighborhood prepare for another long night of trick-or-treating, it appears as if it may be the house that is in for the biggest treat of all. Now, with the adults turning a deaf ear to DJ's strange findings, it's up to the brave young boy and his faithful friends Chowder (voice of Sam Lerner) and Jenny (Spencer Locke) to break through the barrier of the supernatural and defeat the powers of darkness before the house grows too powerful to fight(n)</desc>

When young Louie the Swan is hatched, it's soon discovered that he isn't able to make a sound, which is a matter of no small annoyance to his boastful father (voice of Jason Alexander) and doting mother (voice of Mary Steenburgen). As Louie gets a bit older, he falls in love with Serena (voice of Reese Witherspoon), but he has no way of telling her how he feels. Despondent, Louie flies away, and makes friends with a young boy named Sam (voice of Sam Gifaldi). Sam realizes Louie has a problem, and with the help of his schoolteacher, Mrs. Hammerbotham (Carol Burnett), Louie learns to read and write. Louie is thrilled that he has finally found a way to communicate, but his joy is short-lived when he discovers his fellow swans are not well acquainted with the English language. At long last, Louie finds a way to speak in a way his family and fellows can understand when his father gives him a trumpet; while Louie is thrilled and shows a remarkable gift for the instrument, his dad's happiness is diluted by the fact that the horn is stolen merchandise. Determined to pay for the stolen trumpet and make his family proud, Louie flies away to the big city, where he lands a lucrative gig playing with a jazz combo. At last, Louie has found fame, fortune, and self-respect, but can he win the heart of Serena away from her fiancé, Boyd (Seth Green)? The score for The Trumpet of the Swan was written by noted jazz artist Marcus Miller; rock &amp; roll pioneer Little Richard also contributed a song to the soundtrack(n)</desc>

At the last second, with his life hanging by a thread, Romulus receives the protection of military commander Aurelius (Colin Firth), who assembles a cadre of rebels, including Romulus, the boy's magician instructor, Ambrosinus (Sir Ben Kingsley), and the Indian female warrior Mira (Aishwarya Rai). After Romulus discovers an enchanted sword once claimed by Julius Caesar, the troupe heads out to the province of Britannia and Hadrian's Wall.

When her father's estate is swindled away from her, Molly suddenly finds her life of luxury and excess pulled out from under her. Begrudgingly, she decides that she has to get a job and is hired as a nanny for Ray Schliene (Dakota Fanning), the daughter of record executive Roma Schliene (Heather Locklear).

    <desc lang="en">The Jeopardy Room. Having just defected from an Iron Curtain country, Major Ivan Kuchenko (Martin Landau) realizes that he is not out of the woods yet. Sequestered in a tiny hotel room, Kuchenko knows that he has been targeted for assassination by Commissar Vassiloff (Robert Kelljan). What he doesn't know is that the instrument for death is hidden in his room -- a booby-trapped telephone. Written by Rod Serling, this was one of the few Twilight Zone episodes with no science fiction or fantasy elements whatsoever. "The Jeopardy Room" originally aired April 17, 1964(n)</desc>
