    <title lang="en">Capote</title>
    <desc lang="en">The creation of one of the most memorable books of the 1960s -- and the impact the writing and research would have on its author -- is explored in this drama based on a true story. In 1959, Truman Capote (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman) was a critically acclaimed novelist who had earned a small degree of celebrity for his work when he read a short newspaper item about a multiple murder in a small Kansas town. For some reason, the story fascinated Capote, and he asked William Shawn (Bob Balaban), his editor at The New Yorker, to let him write a piece about the case. Capote had long believed that in the right hands, a true story could be molded into a tale as compelling as any fiction, and he believed this event, in which the brutal and unimaginable was visited upon a community where it was least expected, could be just the right material. Capote traveled to Kansas with his close friend Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), herself becoming a major literary figure with the success of To Kill a Mockingbird, and while Capote's effete and mannered personal style stuck out like a sore thumb in Kansas, in time he gained the trust of Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper), the Kansas Bureau of Investigation agent investigating the murder of the Clutter family, and with his help Capote's magazine piece grew into a full-length book. Capote also became familiar with the petty criminals who killed the Clutter family, Dick Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) and Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.), and in Smith he found a troubling kindred spirit more like himself than he wanted to admit. After attaining a sort of friendship with Smith under the assumption that the man would be executed before the book was ever published, Capote finds himself forced to directly confront the moral implications of his actions with regards to both his role in the man's death, and the way that he would be remembered. Capote also co-stars Bruce Greenwood as Capote's longtime companion Jack Dunphy, and Amy Ryan as Mary Dewey, Alvin's wife who became a confidante of Capote's(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Ocean's Eleven</title>
    <desc lang="en">A rag-tag group of con artists and ex-cons team up for the heist to end all heists in this high-profile remake of the 1960 Rat Pack favorite. As with its predecessor, Ocean's Eleven opens with its titular hero Danny Ocean (George Clooney stepping into the Frank Sinatra role) eager for a new challenge. The similarities to the original end there, as Ocean conspires with his old pal Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) to rob 150 million dollars from an underground vault that serves three of Las Vegas' biggest casinos. Between the two of them, they recruit nine other men, each with his own criminal specialty, to assist in the mission: moneyman Reuben Tishkoff (Elliot Gould), card dealer Frank (Bernie Mac), pickpocket Linus (Matt Damon), aging con artist Saul (Carl Reiner), British explosives pro Basher (Don Cheadle), techie Dell (Eddie Jemison), rude-boy brothers Virgil (Casey Affleck) and Turk (Scott Caan), and professional acrobat Yen (Shaobo Qin). What Ocean doesn't tell the group is that there's another reason he's coordinating the heist: the three casinos they're robbing are all owned by ruthless gambling mogul Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), who just happens to be married to Ocean's former love Tess (Julia Roberts). Ocean's Eleven was updated by scribe Ted Griffin and marked the third feature shot by director Steven Soderbergh under the alias Peter Andrews(n)</desc>

And it's one that could rescue the professional life of subway employee Walter Garber, whose glittering career has been derailed by allegations of corruption. Garber is languishing on duty as a train dispatcher when all hell breaks loose after one of the Lexington Avenue line trains is hijacked by a gang led by the supremely self-assured, calmly ruthless Ryder. Ryder issues a demand for $10m and makes it clear that he won't hesitate to kill anyone who gets in his way. Garber and NYPD hostage negotiator Lieutenant Camonetti attempt to get to grips with the crisis but, as events progress, suspicions arise as to whether there's more to the hijacking than first meets the eye. Also starring James Gandolfini as New York's mayor and Luis Guzmán as a disgruntled subway worker who has joined Ryder's gang(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Day After Tomorrow</title>
    <desc lang="en">Roland Emmerich's blockbuster stars Dennis Quaid as climatologist Jack Hall; a lone voice predicting that global warming will lead to a new ice age. He is ridiculed for his views, but his fears swiftly come true when a dramatic temperature rise in the Antarctic causes the world's weather to go mad, with tornadoes devastating Los Angeles, Britain literally flash-frozen and New York first inundated by floods and then overwhelmed by a killer cold snap. A few survivors, including Jack's son Sam, take refuge in a library and Jack sets out on a desperate mission to save them. The action-packed film (which won a BAFTA for its stunning special effects) may have compressed and dramatised the effects of global warming but, disturbingly, the basic science Emmerich uses in the film to advance the plot isn't that far removed from the increasing dangers the world faces today(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A strong-willed woman recruits a loathsome drifter to help transport three insane women across the unforgiving Nebraska Territories so that they may find sanctuary with a compassionate minister and his wife in this drama directed and co-written by Tommy Lee Jones. Driven to madness by the harsh realities of pioneer life, three women (Grace Gummer, Miranda Otto, and Sonja Richter) living on the outskirts of the American frontier are rescued from certain death by pious Mary Bee Cuddy (Hilary Swank), who selflessly takes on the task of transporting them to safety. Along the way, Mary Bee encounters a low-life named George Briggs (Tommy Lee Jones) with his head in a noose. In exchange for helping her transport the women, Mary Bee frees the scruffy stranger, and together the group heads east. In the course of their arduous journey, however, they will encounter ruthless bandits and vengeful Native Americans. Meanwhile, the greatest test to their resolve may be the harsh winter that's blowing in fast.

During his childhood, an accident involving toxic waste blinded Murdock, but it also enhanced his other senses and gave him a kind of 'radar vision'. The incident was partially caused by his discovery that his father was involved with the Mob. Now, the adult Murdock, spurred partly by Catholic guilt over his role in his father's death, has dedicated this life to fighting crime and protecting the innocent. By day Murdock's a defence lawyer, but by night he dispenses summary justice to criminals who've escaped the courts. Things get complicated when he falls in love with Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner). Not only is she the daughter of a man with connections to New York crime bosses but, unknown to Murdock, she's also a vigilante who's equally keen on figure-hugging leather (black in her case). And when Daredevil is framed for the murder of her father, Elektra swears vengeance on the masked crime-fighter (not realising that he's her lover). Meanwhile, both of them are in mortal danger from the actual killer, a merciless Irish assassin called Bullseye (Colin Farrell)(n)</desc>

The movie begins in a post-apocalyptic 2029, when Los Angeles has been largely reduced to rubble and is under the thumb of all-powerful ruling machines. Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), a member of the human resistance movement, is teleported back to 1984. His purpose: to rescue Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), the mother of the man who will lead the 21st-century rebels against the tyrannical machines, from being assassinated before she can give birth. Likewise thrust back to 1984 is The Terminator (Schwarzenegger), a grim, well-armed, virtually indestructable cyborg who has been programmed to eliminate Sarah Connor. After killing two "Sarah Connors" who turn out to be the wrong women, he finally aims his gunsights at the genuine article. This is the film in which Schwarzenegger declared "I'll be baaaack" -- and back he was, in "kinder and gentler" form, in the even more successful Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Historian Lucy Worsley embarks on a road trip across England to take in some of the places Jane Austen lived in and visited during her lifetime. She aims to demonstrate how Jane's personal experiences influenced the central themes of home and property in her novels, and makes use of detective-work to recreate some of the most important locations that no longer stand. She begins in Stoneleigh Abbey, Warwickshire, retracing a journey that marked one of the many times the Austens veered wildly between wealth and genteel poverty - mirroring the Dashwoods of Sense and Sensibility. Lucy also travels from Jane's birthplace in Steventon, Hampshire, to her brother's grand estate at Godmersham Park - the inspiration for Darcy's Pemberley in Pride and Prejudice, along with Lyme Regis, Bath and Southampton.(n)</desc>

Gabriel also looks at the latest forensic developments, from 3-D laser scanning that can reconstruct the sequence of events at the scene of a gun crime to the pioneering chemistry able to determine where in the world someone has been based on just a few strands of their hair.(n)</desc>

The year saw the rise of one-man acts such as Nik Kershaw and Howard Jones, while Sade brought a stripped-back soulful vibe to jazz pop. German singer Nena hit the top spot with 99 Red Balloons, while the Special AKA's Free Nelson Mandela combined a political message with an irresistible tune.

    <desc lang="en">In June 1985, TWA flight 847 made a routine stop-off in Athens, Greece. Its destination was Rome, but that changed after armed Lebanese militia boarded the plane. Against the backdrop of the Middle East conflict, the terrorists had one objective in mind - the release of hundreds of Islamic prisoners detained in Israel. Seizing the US airliner shortly after take-off, the passengers and crew - including singer Demis Roussos - endured a three-day ordeal involving a stream of landings across various airports. This documentary recalls their experiences.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Daredevil</title>
    <desc lang="en">Mark Steven Johnson's violent superhero fantasy-morality play stars Ben Affleck as Matt Murdock, a guilt-wracked blind vigilante with a penchant for red leather. During his childhood, an accident involving toxic waste blinded Murdock, but it also enhanced his other senses and gave him a kind of 'radar vision'. The incident was partially caused by his discovery that his father was involved with the Mob. Now, the adult Murdock, spurred partly by Catholic guilt over his role in his father's death, has dedicated this life to fighting crime and protecting the innocent. By day Murdock's a defence lawyer, but by night he dispenses summary justice to criminals who've escaped the courts. Things get complicated when he falls in love with Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner). Not only is she the daughter of a man with connections to New York crime bosses but, unknown to Murdock, she's also a vigilante who's equally keen on figure-hugging leather (black in her case). And when Daredevil is framed for the murder of her father, Elektra swears vengeance on the masked crime-fighter (not realising that he's her lover). Meanwhile, both of them are in mortal danger from the actual killer, a merciless Irish assassin called Bullseye (Colin Farrell)(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Daredevil</title>
    <desc lang="en">Mark Steven Johnson's violent superhero fantasy-morality play stars Ben Affleck as Matt Murdock, a guilt-wracked blind vigilante with a penchant for red leather. During his childhood, an accident involving toxic waste blinded Murdock, but it also enhanced his other senses and gave him a kind of 'radar vision'. The incident was partially caused by his discovery that his father was involved with the Mob. Now, the adult Murdock, spurred partly by Catholic guilt over his role in his father's death, has dedicated this life to fighting crime and protecting the innocent. By day Murdock's a defence lawyer, but by night he dispenses summary justice to criminals who've escaped the courts. Things get complicated when he falls in love with Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner). Not only is she the daughter of a man with connections to New York crime bosses but, unknown to Murdock, she's also a vigilante who's equally keen on figure-hugging leather (black in her case). And when Daredevil is framed for the murder of her father, Elektra swears vengeance on the masked crime-fighter (not realising that he's her lover). Meanwhile, both of them are in mortal danger from the actual killer, a merciless Irish assassin called Bullseye (Colin Farrell)(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The trio of motoring enthusiasts embark on another epic road trip, this time across western America in front-engined supercars. Jeremy Clarkson pilots the Lexus LFA, which has a spectacularly high-revving V10 powerplant, Richard Hammond gets behind the wheel of the muscular Dodge Viper, and James May opts for the latest incarnation of Aston Martin's Vanquish. On their journey from Las Vegas to Palm Springs via Los Angeles, the presenters tackle racing circuits and find themselves in a race against the police, before rushing to the Mexican border - and there's a terrifying penalty for the last man to arrive. Meanwhile, Fleetwood Mac drummer Mick Fleetwood rolls up his sleeves to thrash the Reasonably Priced Car.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Gore Verbinski and the crew set sail once again for this, the third chapter in the swashbuckling Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is hopelessly trapped in Davy Jones' locker after a harrowing encounter with the dreaded Kracken, and now Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) must align themselves with the nefarious Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) if they hold out any hope of saving their old friend from a fate worse than death. The East India Trading Company and its fearsome leader, Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), have taken control of the ghostly Flying Dutchman and its captain, Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), and now the baleful Admiral Norrington (Jack Davenport) has taken the helm in a relentless bid to destroy every pirate ship in his path and bring the Age of Piracy to a violent close. Meanwhile, Will, Elizabeth, and Captain Barbossa navigate treacherous waters and face bitter betrayal as they set sail to gather the only army that can stand up to Beckett -- The Nine Lords of the Brethren Court. But Captain Jack Sparrow is one of the lords, and as long as he's stuck in Davy Jones' locker, Beckett and his nefarious armada are sure to emerge victorious. There's still hope, however, if the heroic team that includes Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris), Pintel (Lee Arenberg), and Ragetti (Mackenzie Crook) can reach exotic Singapore and convince vulpine pirate Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat) to provide them with charts and a ship. But even the powerful Brethren Court may need a bit of help from volatile sea goddess Calypso in order to weather the coming storm. With the entire future of the pirate way at stake, everyone will be forced to choose sides while drifting precariously to the edge of the earth for one final, spectacular battle(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A surreal crime drama told as only Jim Jarmusch could, Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai stars Forest Whitaker as Ghost Dog, a hit man living in an unidentified but run-down city in what license plates call "The Industrialized State." Known for his gift of being able to come and go without people noticing him, Ghost Dog is a self-taught samurai who is obsessed with order and his strict personal moral code, drawn from the philosophies of the Japanese warriors. As every samurai needs a leader to whom he swears loyalty, Ghost Dog has devoted himself the service of Louie (John Tormey), a low-level crime boss who once saved his life. When Louie's superiors decide he must be executed, Ghost Dog leaps into action, methodically wiping out his many enemies. Along with a dizzying series of stylized shoot-outs, Ghost Dog also features carrier pigeons, characters who read Rashomon, a French-speaking ice cream man, and a score by RZA from the top-selling hip-hop group Wu-Tang Clan, who have their own well-documented obsession with Asian culture. Ghost Dog was screened in competition at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival(n)</desc>

Rather than allow him to sit around all day, Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) encourages her son to read Johnny Tremain, which Bart does after learning the title character is deformed in an accident. To the surprise of everyone, Bart turns into a budding history buff. Meanwhile, the curious Springfield custom of Whacking Day, in which the local spend one day each year beating snakes senseless, has drawn the ire of Lisa (voice of Yeardley Smith), who is offended by the purposeless cruelty to animals. In an effort to help save the snakes from a grim fate, Lisa attempts to attract the serpents to the safety of the Simpson home with the help of her funky bass guitar and the voice of visiting soul icon Barry White. Bart, meanwhile, has done some research and reveals the startling truth behind the origins of Whacking Day. "Whacking Day" first aired on April 29, 1993(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Food writer Nigella Lawson examines how different days require certain types of food, sharing her favourite menu to help get that balance right in the kitchen. She prepares a light salad of salmon, avocado, watercress and pumpkin seeds, and a chicken shawarma with an array of spices, sauces and flatbreads - a dish inspired by a spit-roasted Lebanese kebab that is perfect for feeding a crowd. Nigella also creates two sweet treats, a glossy liquorice and blackcurrant chocolate cake, and chocolate chip cookie dough pots served with ice-cream or creme fraiche.(n)</desc>

Satan (Harvey Keitel) is considering retirement, and is pondering which of his sons should take over the family business -- ambitious Adrian (Rhys Ifans), strapping Cassius (Tommy "Tiny" Lister Jr.), or Nicky (Adam Sandler), an accident-prone demon who prefers to stay in his room playing his favorite heavy metal tunes. When Satan decides to stay on for another 10,000 years, Adrian is outraged, and leaves Hell to go to New York, where he and Cassius attempt to round up enough souls to vote Satan out of power. Satan, understandably upset, sends Nicky to bring Adrian and Cassius back home, but Nicky finds life on Earth is more complicated than he expected. Things don't get any easier when he develops a crush on Valerie (Patricia Arquette), a good-hearted mortal woman. Little Nicky also features Michael McKean as a city official trying to put Nicky behind bars, Kevin Nealon as Hell's gatekeeper, Rodney Dangerfield as Satan's father, Robert Smigel as the voice of Beefy -- a talking dog who is Nicky's guide on earth, Allen Covert as Todd -- Nicky's new roommate, and Peter Dante and Jonathan Loughran as a pair of metalheads who dig Satan.

    <desc lang="en">The youngest child of the family often has the most problems -- so why should things be different for the Prince of Darkness and his offspring? Satan (Harvey Keitel) is considering retirement, and is pondering which of his sons should take over the family business -- ambitious Adrian (Rhys Ifans), strapping Cassius (Tommy "Tiny" Lister Jr.), or Nicky (Adam Sandler), an accident-prone demon who prefers to stay in his room playing his favorite heavy metal tunes. When Satan decides to stay on for another 10,000 years, Adrian is outraged, and leaves Hell to go to New York, where he and Cassius attempt to round up enough souls to vote Satan out of power. Satan, understandably upset, sends Nicky to bring Adrian and Cassius back home, but Nicky finds life on Earth is more complicated than he expected. Things don't get any easier when he develops a crush on Valerie (Patricia Arquette), a good-hearted mortal woman. Little Nicky also features Michael McKean as a city official trying to put Nicky behind bars, Kevin Nealon as Hell's gatekeeper, Rodney Dangerfield as Satan's father, Robert Smigel as the voice of Beefy -- a talking dog who is Nicky's guide on earth, Allen Covert as Todd -- Nicky's new roommate, and Peter Dante and Jonathan Loughran as a pair of metalheads who dig Satan.

    <desc lang="en">In 1970s Los Angeles, bumbling private eye Holland March (Ryan Gosling) and muscle-for-hire Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) become unlikely partners when they find themselves both looking for a missing woman named Amelia (Margaret Qualley) following the death of a high-profile porn star. Amelia's ties to the deceased actress are unclear, but as other members of the porn industry turn up dead, March and Healy's investigation reveals a much bigger conspiracy than the duo could have ever anticipated. With the help of March's teenage daughter Holly (Angourie Rice), their sleuthing eventually unearths corruption within the federal government. Shane Black (Iron Man 3) directed and co-wrote this action buddy comedy, which co-stars Kim Basinger and Matt Bomer(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Forgetting Sarah Marshall</title>
    <desc lang="en">In desperate need of a vacation after being unceremoniously dumped by his TV-star girlfriend, a man travels to a lavish Hawaiian resort to nurse his wounds and forget his heartache, only to discover that his ex and her handsome new boyfriend are currently staying at the exact same island hot spot. Peter Bretter (Jason Segel) may be just another struggling musician, but for the past six years he's been dating Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell), one of the hottest stars on television. Sarah is everything in the world to Peter, so when she kindly but firmly tells him that they should each go their separate ways, he is absolutely devastated. Later, after attempting to salvage his ego by awkwardly attempting to become a womanizer and nearly losing his job because of a nervous breakdown, an emotionally fragile Peter attempts to put the past behind him by escaping to the sun-soaked beaches of Oahu. While at first it seems as if Peter has discovered the perfect prescription for a bad case of lost love, his plan soon turns to dust when Sarah and her new rock-star boyfriend, Aldous (Russell Brand), turn up at the exact same resort. Though accepting Sarah's lavish new lifestyle won't be easy for the crestfallen Peter, the laid-back companionship of flirtatious resort employee Rachel (Mila Kunis) -- not to mention a continuous regimen of fruity cocktails -- goes a long way in mending the wounds of a broken heart. Forgetting Sarah Marshall was penned by Segel and produced by Judd Apatow. Fun with Dick and Jane screenwriter Nicholas Stoller makes his directorial debut. The cast also includes Paul Rudd, Bill Hader, Jack McBrayer, and Jonah Hill(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">MacArthur</title>
    <desc lang="en">Star Gregory Peck went into MacArthur disliking the title character that he was slated to play, but emerged from the experience with a deeper understanding and respect for this complex historical figure. The film is framed in flashback, with an octogenarian General Douglas MacArthur (Peck) making his final address before his alma mater of West Point. We flash back to the fall of Corregidor in 1942, with MacArthur promising "I shall return" to the beleaguered (and eventually imprisoned) American and Filipino troops. The story follows MacArthur's subsequent victories in the South Pacific, occasionally pausing to show us the General's omnipresent sense of "showmanship" (e.g. his wading ashore on the beaches of the Philippines for the benefit of the newsreel cameras). The greater part of the film involves MacArthur's attempts to restore dignity to the defeated postwar Japan, and to keep the Russian Communists from overtaking the orient as they had Eastern Europe. MacArthur is eventually fired from his post by President Truman after the general defies orders during the Korean conflict. MacArthur was intended as Universal's "answer" to 20th Century-Fox's enormously successful Patton (1970), but box-office returns were disappointing(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Disney's The Kid</title>
    <desc lang="en">If you could talk to the child that you used to be, what advice would you give him? That question forms the basis of this comic fantasy. Forty-year-old Russ Duritz (Bruce Willis) is a wealthy and powerful "image consultant" who has made a career out of telling people how to present themselves. But while he's a success in business, he's a failure in life; he's vain, mean-spirited, and hasn't been able to hold onto a marriage (or even a pet dog). One day, Russ is startled to meet Rusty (Spencer Breslin), a stocky kid whom he soon realizes is himself at the age of eight, having passed through a wrinkle in time. Young Rusty doesn't seem much happier than the grown-up Russ, so the older man takes his younger self under his wing and tries to teach him how to avoid the mistakes he's made, while Rusty encourages Russ to be a more caring human being. Along the way, Russ and Rusty become friends, and realize how much they can learn from each other. Disney's The Kid also stars Jean Smart as one of Russ' clients, Lily Tomlin as his assistant, and Daniel Von Bargen as his father(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Casper</title>
    <desc lang="en">Based on the popular cartoon character, this family-oriented "ghost story" is about a not-so-scary spirit who bonds with a little girl (Christina Ricci). The eternally irritable Ms. Carrigan (Cathy Moriarty) discovers that the only thing she's been left in her recently departed father's will is a rickety old house in New England. Naturally, the woman is furious about this, until her "close personal friend" and assistant, Dibbs (Eric Idle of Monty Python fame), discovers a secret message that a treasure may be concealed somewhere in the house. The two take off for Maine, only to learn that the house is haunted by Casper "the friendly ghost" and his three ghostly uncles Stinky, Stretch, and Fatso. After futilely recruiting an exorcist (Don Novello, more or less reviving his Father Guido Sarducci character from Saturday Night Live) and a "professional ghost exterminator" (Dan Aykroyd), she brings in a "ghost psychiatrist" (Bill Pullman) and his daughter Kat (Ricci). Innocently attracted to the young girl, Casper befriends Kat as they try to save the ghosts' home from the evil Carrigan. Eye-popping special effects highlight this magical story that touches (albeit lightly) on the theme of what lies at the heart of human desires. Clint Eastwood, Rodney Dangerfield, Mel Gibson and The Crypt Keeper (of Tales from the Crypt) all make cameos as apparitions in the mirror Bill Pullman looks into in the house(n)</desc>

Produced entirely over the Internet, where writers uploaded story details and actors submitted audition tapes, Perkins' 14 was released into theaters as part of the third After Dark Horror Fest. Ronald Perkins was just six years old when his parents were brutally slaughtered right before his eyes. Unable to overcome the incredible trauma of witnessing such a diabolical event, Perkins becomes convinced that the killers who murdered his parents will eventually return to finish the job they started years ago -- and he plans to be fully prepared to fight back when they do. Years later, when Perkins turns 34, he kidnaps 14 people from his hometown of Stone Cove and sets about reprogramming them to become relentless killing machines. Now, if the killers ever do return, they'll have to get through Perkins' 14 in order to reach their intended target. Trouble is, now that Perkins' 14 are ready for battle, they've become increasingly difficult to contain(n)</desc>

Crowe is sceptical at first, but - prompted partly by a past case he felt he badly let down - he's gradually convinced that the boy is telling the truth. Crowe believes that actively engaging with the ghostly presences could help both Sear and the spirits to find peace. Overcoming his terror, the lad finds that communicating with the deceased does, at first, seem to be beneficial. But then matters take on their own momentum, leading to one of the director's trademark plot twists... Also starring Toni Collette. M,W,S,(n)</desc>

Jeff Talley (Bruce Willis) used to be a hostage negotiator with the Los Angeles Police Department, but after a standoff goes horribly wrong, Talley moves himself and his family to a small, quiet town of Bristo Camino, where he serves as chief of police. When three young criminals attempt to steal a car from a wealthy accountant, the situation quickly spins out of control and the thieves are trapped inside the heavily fortified home, taking the accountant and his family hostage. The Ventura County Sheriff's Department soon arrives on the scene, and Talley eagerly hands over the situation to them, but when he unexpectedly finds himself in telephone contact with one of the children inside, he begins to suspect that the cops are in over their heads. After he's approached by a masked stranger who has an agenda of his own, Talley is forced to decide if he should protect the safety of the family in the house or his own wife and kids.

Top seeds Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams recorded straight-sets victories over Steve Darcis and Teliana Pereira respectively at this stage in 2016, but while Djokovic will be looking to emulate his triumph last year, Williams was not among the entries this year as she is expecting her first child. Rafael Nadal was also in top form as he dispatched Facundo Bagnis 6-3, 6-0, 6-3, but was forced to withdraw due to injury before his third-round match. This time around, he will be hoping to build on his second place in January's Australian Open, his best performance in a Grand Slam since 2013, and claim this title for a record 10th time. With analysis from Marion Bartoli, Jim Courier, Mark Petchey, Fabrice Santoro and Sam Smith, commentary by Nick Mullins and reports from Celina Hinchcliffe.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">No Man's Land. Despite a grim prognosis, Cristina (Sandra Oh) stubbornly insists upon giving extra-special treatment to cancer patient Liz Fallon (Anna Maria Horsford), who happens to have been the longtime scrub nurse for Meredith's surgeon mother Ellis Grey (Kate Burton). In other developments, a constructor worker is brought to the hospital after shooting six nails in his head, a feat that turns out to be something far more than an on-the-job accident; and George (T.R. Knight) rebels at being treated as "one of the girls" by roomies Meredith (Ellen Pompeo) and Izzie (Katherine Heigl). The episode's high point occurs when Alex (Justin Chambers) comes across a sexy lingerie ad featuring Izzie, which he then pastes all over the interns' locker room--leading to an extremely revealing moment!(n)</desc>

Back at Seattle Grace, Derek picks George to assist him during an extremely delicate brain operation, but George may lose the opportunity if he speaks up about the drinking problem of veteran anestheseologist Dr. Taylor. Elsewhere, Izzie performs emergency surgery on a disgruntled gent who has swallowed his girlfriend's car keys; Alex (Justin Chambers) meets a fellow former wrestler named Owens (Russell Hornsby), who has developed a morbid fascination with self-mutilation; and several of the interns become involved in the plight of a teenager who is suffering the aftereffects of a botched gastric bypass operation(n)</desc>

Ironically, the perfect donor turns out to be the very man whom Seibert killed on the road, placing the surgical interns smack in the middle of a major ethical dilemma. Elsewhere, George (T.R.

How long would it take the ecosphere to rebound from the damage thrust onto it by men and women, in the instance that homo sapiens vanish? These are the sorts of questions posed by Aftermath - Population Zero.

    <desc lang="en">Ethan is in charge during the night shift, when a patient going by the name of Valentine comes in with bad facial injuries, and while it seems likely they were caused in a fight, he refuses to admit it. He does, however, have plenty of time to flirt with Lily. Meanwhile, Charlie breaks down and discovers a couple, Alex and Janie, who have crashed nearby. The police arrive and soon everyone is at the hospital - only for a suspicious death to arouse the officers' suspicion. However, Lily is the one who tries to piece the puzzle together - but in doing so, she puts her own life in danger. Standalone episode of the medical drama, starring Crystal Yu, Derek Thompson and George Rainsford, with guest appearances from former EastEnders stars Gary Lucy (Danny) and Ruth Gemmell (Whitney's mum Debra).(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Grand Designs</title>
    <desc lang="en">Kevin McCloud returns to Devon for an update on an inspirational build. Royal Marine Captain Jon White and his wife Becky were living happily in a small cottage when in June 2010, while serving in Afghanistan, Jon stepped on an improvised explosive device, losing three limbs. Every part of their lives had to change - starting with where they could live. Their architect came up with a cutting-edge, semi open-plan building with a dramatic wing-like-roof - and crucially no obvious signs of adaptations for Jon's disabilities. Has the new home proved as enabling for the couple and their expanding family as they had hoped?.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">London's super-rich are maximising their properties as never before, by digging down and creating new basements to house anything from cinemas, swimming pools and squash courts to wine cellars and servants' quarters. However, some take as long as three years to complete - and the noise of the digging, fleets of concrete mixers and builders' lorries has made daily life hell in some of the capital's poshest neighbourhoods. This documentary tells the story of the conflict that has resulted from some of these improvements, going behind the scenes as Kensington council responds to angry residents, and featuring contributions from owners, builders and irate neighbours.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Ross Kemp heads to South Africa, 20 years after apartheid was lifted, only to discover that a new set of problems exist, such as a widening gap between rich and poor. However, as he enters the deprived township of Diepsloot on the outskirts of Johannesburg, he discovers an even bigger crisis. Rape has reached epidemic proportions in the country, with statistics showing one in two women born in South Africa will be attacked in their lifetime. Meeting victims and perpetrators, he asks how attitudes to women can change, and what the government can do to curb this abhorrent crime.(n)</desc>

Rick (Dominic Monaghan), Adam (Shawn Ashmore), Henson (Cory Hardrict), and Shannon (Shannyn Sossamon) have been journeying together for months and are the last living members of a much larger group. Mary (Ashley Bell) is a solitary woman who crossed paths with the survivors and is now traveling with them. She isn't interested in discussing her past or becoming friends, but the others learn she's a powerful ally in a fight. The travelers take shelter in a house, but are soon surrounded by cannibals; they quickly realize just how strong a warrior Mary can be, while also discovering the terrible truth that led her to wander alone. The Day was directed by Douglas Aarniokoski, who has accumulated extensive credits as an assistant director and helming second-unit material on major films(n)</desc>

The stories of legend are true, and the magical relics owned by such celebrated figures as Cinderella really exist. The malevolent force known as The Krugen knows well that the owner of these objects will reap ultimate power, because by obtaining the magical mirror once owned by the Evil Queen who tormented Snow White, they were able to herald the arrival of the Dark Ages. Centuries later, former Hunter Mason has become a loyal servant of The Krugen. He knows that once he locates all of the pieces of the mirror no one will be able to challenge his evil reign. But Jordyn and Carter Flynn hail from a long line of Hunters, and they've got just the skills to prevent Mason from achieving his diabolical plan. When Jordyn and Carter learn that their parents have gone missing during an important mission, they vow to track them down, and head off a disaster that could alter the entire course of history(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Bank Job</title>
    <desc lang="en">Jason Statham and Saffron Burrows star in director Roger Donaldson's cinematic account of the true-life 1971 London bank robbery that baffled the authorities and fascinated the public. Terry Leather (Statham) was a small-time car dealer who was trying to leave his shady past behind and start a family. Though he'd never been involved in any major crimes, he wasn't exactly on the straight and narrow his whole life either. Martine Love (Burrows) is a beautiful model from Terry's old neighborhood who knows that her former neighbor is no angel. When Martine proposes a foolproof plan to rob a Baker Street bank, Terry recognizes the danger but realizes this may be the opportunity of a lifetime. As the operation gets underway, the resourceful band of thieves burrows its way into a safe-deposit vault at the Lloyds Bank in Marylebone, quickly hitting a literal treasure trove of cash and priceless gems. But while the crew did know that the safe-deposit boxes contained millions in riches, they didn't realize that they also contained secrets that implicated everyone from London's most notorious underworld gangsters to powerful government figures, and even the Royal Family. Though the crime would make headlines all across Britain for several days after the fact, a government gag order eventually brought all reporting on the case to an immediate halt. Could it be that the most notorious bank robbers in recent memory were actually the most innocent people involved in this scandalous crime?(n)</desc>

Eddie (Richard Gere) is a bitter and disillusioned veteran cop who's a week away from retirement. Tango (Don Cheadle) is an undercover narcotics cop who tries desperately to leave the streets and earn a promotion to a desk job. Much like Eddie, he's lost sight of his priorities and his loyalties seem to lie more with notorious inner-city drug dealer Caz (Wesley Snipes) than with the boys in blue. At the same time, narcotics detective Sal is a family man in despair and needs to raise money to buy a better house for his family. In seven days, the lives of all three officers will converge at one crime scene(n)</desc>

Eddie (Richard Gere) is a bitter and disillusioned veteran cop who's a week away from retirement. Tango (Don Cheadle) is an undercover narcotics cop who tries desperately to leave the streets and earn a promotion to a desk job. Much like Eddie, he's lost sight of his priorities and his loyalties seem to lie more with notorious inner-city drug dealer Caz (Wesley Snipes) than with the boys in blue. At the same time, narcotics detective Sal is a family man in despair and needs to raise money to buy a better house for his family. In seven days, the lives of all three officers will converge at one crime scene(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The work of international superstar Stephen Chow, Kung Fu Hustle is a humorous, special-effects-filled, action-packed martial arts epic set in early '40s China. A bumbling thief named Sing (Stephen Chow) desires to be the toughest member of the dreaded gangster hit squad known as The Axe Gang, but to completely join the gang he has to commit murder. When Sing attempts to rob a crowded run-down apartment complex known as Pig Sty Alley, the locals begin to defend themselves with some high-flying kung fu skills, and a tiny war erupts between the local masters and the axe-wielding gang. After the gang busts the ancient kung fu king known as The Beast (Leung Siu Lung) out of jail, tensions reach a boiling point as Pig Sty Alley's landlady (Yuen Qiu) leads an all-out attack against the gang and Sing discovers his true heroic fate. Kung Fu Hustle, which set box-office records across Asia during its December 2004 release, also stars Yuen Wah and Xing Yu, and features fight choreography by legendary masters of martial arts cinema Yuen Woo Ping and Sammo Hung(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</title>
    <desc lang="en">Tobe Hooper's influential cult classic continues the subgenre of horror films based on the life and "career" of Wisconsin serial killer Ed Gein, which began with Alfred Hitchcock's own influential cult classic Psycho. When Sally Hardesty (Marilyn Burns) hears that the Texas cemetery where her grandfather is buried has been vandalized, she gathers her wheelchair-bound brother Franklin (Paul A. Partain) and several other friends together to see if grandpa's remains are still in one piece. While in the area, Sally and her friends decide to visit grandfather's old farmhouse. Unfortunately, a family of homicidal slaughterhouse workers who take their job home with them have taken over the house next door. Included amongst the brood is Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen), a chainsaw-wielding human horror show who wears a face mask made out of human skin. Sally's friends are rapidly exterminated one-by-one by the next-door neighbors, leaving only Sally left to fight off Leatherface and his clan(n)</desc>

Scripted by Robert Presnell, Jr. from a short story by John Collier, this Twilight Zone episode focuses on Robert Shackleforth (George Grizzard), a lovestruck young man who cannot get the girl of his dreams, the ravishing Leila (Patricia Barry), to acknowledge his existence. In desperation, Robert pays a visit to the mysterious Professor Daemon (John McIntyre), who gives the young would-be romeo a potion that transforms the icy Leila into Robert's "love slave." Before long, however, Robert regrets having Leila hanging upon him like a clinging vine, leading him to contemplate using Daemon's special antidote: The dreaded "glove cleaner." Previously dramatized in 1951 on Billy Rose Television Theater, "The Chaser" made its Twilight Zone bow on May 13, 1960(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A World of His Own. The first season Twilight Zone came to a delightful conclusion on July 1, 1960, with this episode, written by Richard Matheson. Coming home early one afternoon, Victoria West (Phyllis Kirk) is shocked to find her playwright husband Gregory West (Keenan Wynn) in the arms of another woman named Mary (Mary LaRoche). When Victoria demands an explanation, Gregory is forced to reveal that Mary was purely a figment of his imagination, "invented" on the writer's tape recorder. To prove this point, Gregory not only makes Mary re-appear, but also a "huge, red-eyed element." But this is not the only surprise in store for the nonplussed Victoria West. The hilarious finale finds series creator Rod Serling joining in on the festivities(n)</desc>

As had been the case with the first season's inaugural episode "Where Is Everybody?", the second season of Twilight Zone opened with a "solo" drama, wherein the protagonist finds himself alone in a bizarre situation, with no memory of how he got there. In "King Nine Will Not Return," Robert Cummings stars as Army Air Force captain James Embry, who awakens to find himself stumbling through the desert, near the wreckage of a WWII bomber. Laboriously putting the pieces together, Embry desperately searches for his fellow crew members, who seemingly appear and disappear right before his eyes. Inspired by the recent disovery of the wreckage of the American bomber Lady Be Good in the Libyan Desert, "King Nine Will Not Return" was written by Rod Serling and first aired September 30, 1960(n)</desc>

Peterson]), CSI: Crime Scene Investigation was able to go off on a new tangent for its second-season opener. The case at hand: the drug-related death of Las Vegas casino executive Tony Braun. Early evidence suggests that Braun OD'ed on heroin, but further investigation reveals that the victim was bound with duct tape just before his demise. Grissom's conclusion: Braun was forced to literally drug himself to death. Originally slated to air on September 20, 2001, "Burked" was moved back one week due to ongoing network coverage of the 9/11 tragedy(n)</desc>
