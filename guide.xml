    <title lang="en">Dim Sum Funeral</title>
    <desc lang="en">Death brings a contentious family together (though that doesn't mean they get along) in this comedy-drama from director Anna Chi. When elderly Mrs. Xiao (Lisa Lu) dies in her sleep at home, her housekeeper and close friend Viola (Talia Shire) contacts her four adult children in hopes they'll come home to help with the funeral. Unfortunately, Mrs. Xiao didn't have many friends besides Viola, her children all have issues with her, and given her zeal to assimilate into American culture, the siblings are more than puzzled that she insisted upon a traditional Chinese funeral lasting a full seven days. Alexander (Russell Wong), a successful doctor, is still coming to terms with his overly strict mother and philandering father, and is unexpectedly reunited with his ex-wife (Kelly Hu), who he lost through his own infidelity. Elizabeth (Julia Nickson), a writer, also crosses paths with her former spouse (Adrian Hough) while she mourns both her mother and her young son. Victoria (Francoise Yip) has never been able to forgive her mom after she rejected her for marrying an African-American. And MeiMei (Steph Song), an actress, is a lesbian who wants to have children with her significant other Deedee (Bai Ling); they've been having trouble finding a suitable sperm donor, though they think one of the monks at the funeral may be just what they're looking for. Dim Sum Funeral received its world premiere at the 2008 AFI Fest(n)</desc>

Now Ryback must use all his old skills to take on the baddies.

    <title lang="en">The Negotiator</title>
    <desc lang="en">(1998) F Gary Gray's action-thriller starring Samuel L Jackson and Kevin Spacey. When police hostage negotiator Danny Roman (Jackson) unwittingly gets involved in a colleague's attempt to expose financial fraud within the force, he quickly finds himself in very deep water. With the colleague found shot dead, and the embezzlement being pinned on him, Roman snaps and takes a surprising course of action: he turns his police role on its head and - in an effort to buy himself time to prove his innocence - takes hostage a number of people in the Internal Affairs Department, including his chief accuser Terence Niebaum (JT Walsh). Roman's next step is to demand the presence of Chris Sabian (Spacey), a fellow hostage negotiator who works on the other side of the city, and so, Roman hopes, is unconnected with the plot to frame him. But can such a reckless strategy have any chance of paying off? Also starring David Morse, Siobhan Fallon and Paul Giamatti. M,W,R(n)</desc>

But, while celebrating her birthday with Edward's family of 'vegetarian' vampires, a frightening incident convinces Edward that he's simply too dangerous to be around his sweetheart. He decides to leave the town of Forks in order to ensure her safety - leaving her behind, angry and depressed. Bella finds some relief from her emotional numbness through recklessly riding motorbikes and succumbing to the attentions of her friend Jacob Black. But he is also a supernatural being, and not one with a natural affinity to vampires... Also starring Michael Sheen(n)</desc>

His nine-month, seven-million-step journey takes him through jungles, savannah, deserts, cities and war zones in some of Africa's most remote and spectacular locations. Along the way, he encounters modern Africa, its people and its wildlife face-to-face and at ground level. This first episode follows Lev and his guide Boston's first 1000 miles, from the river's source in the Rwandan rainforest, through remote and lawless regions of Tanzania and into Uganda. After dodging crocodiles and hippos, and attending a wedding as VIPs, Lev and Boston are given a hero's welcome in Kampala and blessed by a witch doctor on the shores of Lake Victoria. Lev and Boston are the first outsiders to trek through the world-famous Murchison Falls National Park, where they meet the men and women fighting a daily battle against the poachers. Later, they're joined by two travel journalists, and head deep into the Ajai game reserve where an impenetrable swamp forces them into remote, barren ground cut off from civilisation. But even with rangers to carry their kit and extra water, nothing can prepare them for what lies ahead.

    <desc lang="en">Piers Taylor and Caroline Quentin visit an island in Norway, spending two days in a house built on a footprint of just 100 square metres. In Spain, the pair head to a home built into a steep cliff face overlooking the Mediterranean, featuring a cantilevered terrace offering maximum sea views and a swimming pool as well as an unusual tiled roof. After viewing a house in New Zealand crafted from two separate wooden cladded structures, the duo explore a home in Canada inspired by two ships in dry dock, designed to peer over the coast, allowing the sea to pass underneath.(n)</desc>

It was some of the worst football violence seen at an international tournament and raised serious concerns ahead of millions of fans travelling to Russia for the 2018 World Cup. To find out what UK supporters could face, film-maker Alex Stockley von Statzer travels to Russia to investigate this new generation of `firms' who are teetotal, physically fit and trained in martial arts. He also finds out how Russian police are enacting new laws promising to get tough on any trouble-makers, and films an organised fight in the woods where one firm is `auditioning' new members.(n)</desc>

He explains how the work of Michelangelo fuelled the Fig Leaf Campaign censorship effort, how Bernini created a new form of erotica with his use of the slipping gauze, and how Rodin brought depictions of nudity back to the public's attention. The presenter argues that Victorians had a more sophisticated and mature attitude to sexuality than is found today, and offers his view that modern art could be redeemed from cheap sensation by the return of the fig leaf.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Richard Hammond gets behind the wheel of the mid-engined Alfa Romeo 4C on the shores of Lake Como in Italy - but his enjoyment of the lightweight vehicle is disturbed by the arrival of Jeremy Clarkson, who demands a race against his quad bike. Jeremy also visits Belgium, putting the McLaren P1 hypercar to the test in Bruges and around the Spa-Francorchamps Formula One circuit - and its combined power output of more than 900bhp generated from electricity and turbocharged petrol V8 power is likely to cause astonishment. Meanwhile, James May spends time at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan to learn about the army's vehicle redeployment efforts, and Thor star Tom Hiddleston tries to coax the best time he can muster from the Reasonably Priced Car.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The three petrolheads demonstrate their love of small cars with a trip to Ukraine. Jeremy Clarkson chooses a Volkswagen Up for the journey, while Richard Hammond takes a Ford Fiesta and James May opts for a Dacia Sandero. On their adventure, the trio absorb the history of the Crimean Peninsula, including a visit to an old submarine pen - but the carefree exploration looks likely to become a chore when Jeremy, Richard and James are challenged to a long drive north through the expansive country, during which they must combat serious boredom. And as if that wasn't arduous enough, a new task is set when they arrive in Kiev - a trip into the wasteland of Chernobyl. This edition also features a track test of the Danish Zenvo ST1 supercar and James Blunt returns for another drive in the Reasonably Priced Car.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Castle Ghosts of Scotland</title>
    <desc lang="en">Castle Ghosts of Scotland explores the eerie grounds of three of Scotland's most haunted castles: Glamis, Duntrune, and Fyvie. With a history every bit as bloody and treacherous as Shakespeare's +MacBeth, it's no wonder Scotland has so many ghosts. The childhood home of England's Queen Mother, Glamis Castle is reputed to be the most haunted castle in the United Kingdom -- despite resembling the Disney castle. In 1537, King James V accused the young and beautiful Lady Glamis of witchcraft. Burned at the stake, the ghost known as the "Grey Lady of Glamis" haunts the castle to this day. As the program travels to Aberdeenshire, Fyvie Castle's "Green Lady" ghost is revealed to be Dame Lillias Drummond, who was starved to death by her husband, Sir Alexander Seton. In 1615 during a feud between the McDonalds and the Campbells, a piper loyal to the McDonald clan had his fingers chopped off by the Campbells and bled to death. Current owners of the castle report strange knocking on doors, the sound of footsteps running -- and late at night, the soft strains of bagpipes being played in the tower(n)</desc>

But his mysterious death at just 19 years of age has never been explained. Now, Dallas Campbell reveals new scientific research aimed at getting to the truth. A CT scan of the pharaoh's mummified body creates a full-size image of the real Tutankhamun, while DNA analysis uncovers a shocking secret about his family background - and the genetic trail leads to a revolutionary new theory about his sudden and unexpected death.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter is re-imagined as a contemporary high school comedy in this tale of a scheming student who plots to give her popularity a boost by painting herself the easiest lay in school. Like most high school kids, Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone) just wants to be popular. So much so than when her best friend, Rhiannon (Aly Michalka), asks Olive how her weekend went, the bored teen decides to whip up a spicy white lie just to make things interesting. But that minor exaggeration begins to take on a life of its own when it reaches the ears of motor-mouth gossip Jesus freak Marianne (Amanda Bynes), and in no time the entire student body is abuzz over unassuming Olive's unrepentant weekend of debauchery. Of course not a word of it is true, but that doesn't stop everyone in school from talking, and an amused Olive from deciding to go with the flow. Playing the role of the hussy to the hilt, the girl who used to be invisible begins dressing provocatively and turning heads in the hallways. The students aren't the only ones taking notice, either; Olive's English teacher, Mr. Griffith (Thomas Haden Church), is concerned that the kind of attention she's receiving isn't healthy for a developing girl, and his wife (Lisa Kudrow), the school guidance counselor, is in full agreement. The only people who seem remotely interested in the truth are Olive's trusting and open-minded parents (Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson). As Olive takes note of the parallels between her own situation and the plight of the Scarlet Letter heroine Hester Prynne, she realizes that she may be able to manipulate her newfound notoriety to give fellow classmate Brandon's (Dan Byrd) popularity a much-needed shot in the arm. Olive never thought her little game could possibly have any negative effect on anyone but herself, but when loose lips start sinking ships all around her, she realizes that it's high time for the truth to come out(n)</desc>

Emperor penguins cross a treacherous frozen sea, and rockhoppers brave stormy seas before they come ashore and face a daunting assault up a 300ft cliff, where they are vulnerable to predators. Meanwhile, the tropical humboldts have to evade sea lions, dodge vampire bats and battle sea birds before they can lay their eggs in the desert. All the while, their every move is being secretly filmed by hidden spy technology, including robotic penguins with cameras for eyes.(n)</desc>

Night Shyamalan returns to the summer box office landscape that served as the backdrop for his cinematic breakthrough. In Signs, another paranormal outing for the writer-director, Shyamalan explores the eerie implications of a 500-foot crop circle that mysteriously appears on the Bucks County, PA farm of reverend Graham Hess (Mel Gibson). As Hess and his family (Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin, Abigail Breslin) try to take stock of what the sign means, and how its message incorporates into their faith, they start to get the feeling they are not alone in the fields behind their house. Shyamalan re-teams with producers Frank Marshall, Sam Mercer and Kathleen Kennedy, and produces the project in association with his Blinding Edge Pictures banner and Touchstone Pictures(n)</desc>

As the most recent in a long line of caesars, a young Roman child, Romulus (Thomas Sangster), is poised to inherit the throne -- until Germanic forces invade, lay siege to the city, and brutally murder his parents. At the last second, with his life hanging by a thread, Romulus receives the protection of military commander Aurelius (Colin Firth), who assembles a cadre of rebels, including Romulus, the boy's magician instructor, Ambrosinus (Sir Ben Kingsley), and the Indian female warrior Mira (Aishwarya Rai). After Romulus discovers an enchanted sword once claimed by Julius Caesar, the troupe heads out to the province of Britannia and Hadrian's Wall. There, the men will regroup with the Ninth Legion and plan one final triumphant stand against the barbarian invaders of Rome(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Kill Bill director Quentin Tarantino and Sin City director Robert Rodriguez join forces to offer a cinematic tribute to the blood-soaked exploitation epics of yesteryear with this hyper-violent coupling of two full-length features punctuated by a collection of outrageous trailers. The first segment, directed by Rodriguez and entitled Planet Terror, details the violent struggle between a ravenous army of zombie-like humanoids who have taken control of the planet and the remaining survivors who refuse to go down without a fight. Freddy Rodriguez, Naveen Andrews, and Rose McGowan headline a cast that also includes Marley Shelton, Michael Biehn, Josh Brolin, Bruce Willis, and Tom Savini. In Death Proof -- director Tarantino's take on such peddle-to-the-metal shockers as White Line Fever -- Kurt Russell stars as an engine-revving psychopath who prefers to take out his beautiful victims at 200 mph. With a list of potential roadkill candidates that includes Rose McGowan, Jordan Ladd, Rosario Dawson, and Vanessa Ferlito, Death Proof takes viewers on an adrenaline-infused drive that's as sexy as it is shocking. Its tantalizing title borrowed from the term frequently used to describe the seedy, 1970s-era inner-city movie theaters that screened excessive, low-budget independent films containing copious amounts of violence and nudity as a means of offering counter-programming to the decidedly more restrained big-budget studio films, Grindhouse takes its love for these unabashedly sleazy efforts one step further by offering a jaw-dropping collection of fake exploitation trailers from such directors as Rob Zombie, Eli Roth, and Edgar Wright(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Estranged from his parents by circumstance and nudged toward a foster family, a young boy seeks out his long-lost folks and discovers prodigious musical talent in this family-oriented drama from Disco Pigs director Kirsten Sheridan. In the aftermath of a passionate night together above New York's Washington Square, a charismatic Irish guitarist named Louis (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) and a reserved cellist named Lyla (Keri Russell) are forced apart by fate. Despite the fact that they do not remain together, however, their fleeting union has created something amazing that neither could have ever anticipated -- a baby. Unfortunately, just after the child's birth, the mother is misinformed that the infant has died. Cut to 11 years later, when the child, Evan, is living in a Gotham-area boys' home and has developed an acute ability to listen to the sounds of the outside world -- hoping against all hope that his biological mother and father will turn up to claim him, while those in charge try to encourage him to open himself up to the possibility of adoption. Unduly rejecting these bids, Evan runs away into the city. Out on the streets, the child falls into the clutches of a manipulative, untrustworthy street person named Wizard (Robin Williams), who renames Evan "August Rush" and opens the boy up to the depth and breadth of his own musical talent even as he smells the opportunity to grow rich off of the foundling. Meanwhile, Evan/August's hope persists that he will be reunited with his folks, and Louis and Lyla, unable to forget their initial night of love, feel themselves being drawn back together by fate(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Fence</title>
    <desc lang="en">In October 2006, the United States government authorized the construction of a massive fence stretching seven hundred miles along the border separating the U.S. and Mexico. Proponents of the fence claimed that it would help prevent illegal immigration into the United States and foil drug smuggling. However, three years into the construction project, undocumented aliens are still streaming into America through communities divided by the fence, and drug traffic has not been significantly reduced. The fence also runs through a number of Mexican communities, dividing small towns and school campuses thanks to poor planning, and the construction has had a negative effect on the environment of previously unspoiled territories. The fence is ugly, impractical and ineffective -- so why is America still spending billions on dollars on completing a project that's a failure? Filmmaker Rory Kennedy examines the strange history and sometimes comical consequences of the border project in the documentary The Fence; produced for the premium cable network HBO, The Fence received its world premiere at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Miss Evers' Boys</title>
    <desc lang="en">Produced for the HBO cable network, this docudrama explores the social and ethical issues at the heart of the infamous Tuskegee Study of Untreated Blacks With Syphilis. From 1932 through 1972, the U.S. Public Health Service studied 600 poor African-American sharecroppers in Macon County, AL -- 399 chronic syphilitics and a 201-man healthy control group. Doctors treated the men with placebos, hid the true nature of their research, and withheld penicillin even after it became the standard and highly effective treatment for the disease in the mid-'40s. Although the experiment was hardly a secret, it was not until the early '70s that a public outcry developed; by then, all but 127 of the original study group had died. A class-action lawsuit obtained modest financial reparations for the participants and their descendants, but it was not until 1997 that President Bill Clinton offered an official government apology for the study. Framed as a series of flashbacks during the 1971 congressional hearings about the experiment, the film employs the viewpoint of Eunice Evers (Alfre Woodard), a local nurse who knew of the study's true nature, but devoted her life to caring for the men as they suffered horrifying physical and mental debilities and eventually died. The film charts her warm personal relationships with many of the participants -- the title refers to a singing and dancing troupe named in her honor -- and her failed romance with Caleb Humphries (Laurence Fishburne), an experimental subject who obtained penicillin from a military doctor and left the study to fight in World War II. Miss Evers' Boys was adapted from the play by David Feldshuh, which was itself based on the book Bad Blood: The Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment by James H. Jones. Although fictionalized, the title character is based on the real-life Eunice Rivers. The film won three Emmy Awards, including top acting honors for Woodard(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Estranged from his parents by circumstance and nudged toward a foster family, a young boy seeks out his long-lost folks and discovers prodigious musical talent in this family-oriented drama from Disco Pigs director Kirsten Sheridan. In the aftermath of a passionate night together above New York's Washington Square, a charismatic Irish guitarist named Louis (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) and a reserved cellist named Lyla (Keri Russell) are forced apart by fate. Despite the fact that they do not remain together, however, their fleeting union has created something amazing that neither could have ever anticipated -- a baby. Unfortunately, just after the child's birth, the mother is misinformed that the infant has died. Cut to 11 years later, when the child, Evan, is living in a Gotham-area boys' home and has developed an acute ability to listen to the sounds of the outside world -- hoping against all hope that his biological mother and father will turn up to claim him, while those in charge try to encourage him to open himself up to the possibility of adoption. Unduly rejecting these bids, Evan runs away into the city. Out on the streets, the child falls into the clutches of a manipulative, untrustworthy street person named Wizard (Robin Williams), who renames Evan "August Rush" and opens the boy up to the depth and breadth of his own musical talent even as he smells the opportunity to grow rich off of the foundling. Meanwhile, Evan/August's hope persists that he will be reunited with his folks, and Louis and Lyla, unable to forget their initial night of love, feel themselves being drawn back together by fate(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Fence</title>
    <desc lang="en">In October 2006, the United States government authorized the construction of a massive fence stretching seven hundred miles along the border separating the U.S. and Mexico. Proponents of the fence claimed that it would help prevent illegal immigration into the United States and foil drug smuggling. However, three years into the construction project, undocumented aliens are still streaming into America through communities divided by the fence, and drug traffic has not been significantly reduced. The fence also runs through a number of Mexican communities, dividing small towns and school campuses thanks to poor planning, and the construction has had a negative effect on the environment of previously unspoiled territories. The fence is ugly, impractical and ineffective -- so why is America still spending billions on dollars on completing a project that's a failure? Filmmaker Rory Kennedy examines the strange history and sometimes comical consequences of the border project in the documentary The Fence; produced for the premium cable network HBO, The Fence received its world premiere at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Miss Evers' Boys</title>
    <desc lang="en">Produced for the HBO cable network, this docudrama explores the social and ethical issues at the heart of the infamous Tuskegee Study of Untreated Blacks With Syphilis. From 1932 through 1972, the U.S. Public Health Service studied 600 poor African-American sharecroppers in Macon County, AL -- 399 chronic syphilitics and a 201-man healthy control group. Doctors treated the men with placebos, hid the true nature of their research, and withheld penicillin even after it became the standard and highly effective treatment for the disease in the mid-'40s. Although the experiment was hardly a secret, it was not until the early '70s that a public outcry developed; by then, all but 127 of the original study group had died. A class-action lawsuit obtained modest financial reparations for the participants and their descendants, but it was not until 1997 that President Bill Clinton offered an official government apology for the study. Framed as a series of flashbacks during the 1971 congressional hearings about the experiment, the film employs the viewpoint of Eunice Evers (Alfre Woodard), a local nurse who knew of the study's true nature, but devoted her life to caring for the men as they suffered horrifying physical and mental debilities and eventually died. The film charts her warm personal relationships with many of the participants -- the title refers to a singing and dancing troupe named in her honor -- and her failed romance with Caleb Humphries (Laurence Fishburne), an experimental subject who obtained penicillin from a military doctor and left the study to fight in World War II. Miss Evers' Boys was adapted from the play by David Feldshuh, which was itself based on the book Bad Blood: The Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment by James H. Jones. Although fictionalized, the title character is based on the real-life Eunice Rivers. The film won three Emmy Awards, including top acting honors for Woodard(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In September 2004, comedian Dave Chappelle took a break from his immensely successful Comedy Central show to stage a free, unpublicized, all-star hip-hop concert in the Clinton Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn, NY. Inviting fans over the Internet, on the street, and even in his family's hometown of Yellow Springs, OH, Chappelle asked filmmaker Michel Gondry to document the event from its inception on through to the performances themselves. The result is Dave Chappelle's Block Party, a concert film that provides not only a sampling of the music on display that September, but also an intimate look at the comedian himself. Gondry's cameras tag along with Chappelle as he visits Ohio, recruits a university marching band to play at the show, and surveys the opinions of Clinton Hill on the show that's about to take place. Along the way, we're introduced to some the comedian's favorite acts, in rehearsals and on-stage: Dead Prez, Jill Scott, Mos Def, the Roots, Erykah Badu, Kanye West, and the surprise reuniting of the Fugees(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">He's mean, he's green, and he's doesn't like the Yuletide season one bit -- Jim Carrey stars in this live-action adaptation of the classic children's story by Dr. Seuss (aka Theodore Geisel). High atop Mt. Crumpet, the Grinch (Carrey) observes the residents of Whoville joyously preparing to celebrate Christmas. The Grinch was born in Whoville years ago, but was shunned due to his scary appearance, and his unrequited love for Martha May Whovier has turned him bitter; the good cheer of the Whos has been a thorn in his side ever since. Finally the Grinch decides he's had enough of all this happiness, and with the wary aid of his dog Max, the Grinch conspires to steal Christmas from Whoville, making off with their presents, holiday decorations, Christmas trees, and everything else used to enjoy the holiday. Molly Shannon, Christine Baranski, Jeffrey Tambor, and Clint Howard play several of the citizens of Whoville, while Anthony Hopkins narrates (taking over from the late Boris Karloff, who memorably read Dr. Seuss' story in Chuck Jones' 1966 animated adaptation of the story).

    <title lang="en">The Last Mimzy</title>
    <desc lang="en">An intergalactic package discovered on the beach holds a myriad of fantastic discoveries for siblings Noah and Emma Wilder in The Last Mimzy, studio head-turned-director Bob Shaye's wondrous sci-fi fantasy parable. The children stumble onto their discovery amid a trip to the family beach house, and find inside of the crate strange crystals that Emma levitates with her mind, as well as the Mimzy -- a stuffed bunny with a built-in supercomputer that advances its possessor's brain by great leaps and bounds by whispering into the person's ear. Meanwhile, via interaction with the box and its contents, Noah gains the ability to converse with spiders and instructs them to build miniature bridges. He also etches complex Tibetan mandalas, and somehow manages to black out half of Seattle. The children naturally keep these happenings (and the box) from their mom and dad (Joely Richardson and Timothy Hutton), but in time the kids set their sights higher and embark on correcting huge problems that cannot be missed. Rainn Wilson (The Office) co-stars as the children's hippie science teacher; New Age expert Bruce Joel Rubin (Ghost, Jacob's Ladder) and Toby Emmerich co-authored the script, adapting the 1943 short story Mimsy Were the Borogoves, by Lewis Padgett(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The directorial debut of Glenn Gordon Caron, the creator of the television series Moonlighting (1985-89), this intense, gritty drama was received as one of the best-ever cinematic treatments of substance abuse. Michael Keaton stars as Daryl Poynter, a hustling, successful Philadelphia real estate agent who has become addicted to cocaine. He's already got problems, including nearly a $100,000 embezzled from his employer and lost on the stock market, when he wakes up one morning with a young woman dead in his bed from a coke overdose. His company is asking questions about the missing funds, and the dead girl's father is plastering his neighborhood with posters accusing Daryl of being a murderer, so he decides to hide out in an anonymous drug treatment program. There, however, Daryl runs into tough-minded counselor and former addict Craig (Morgan Freeman), who has heard all of Daryl's lies and tricks before. Daryl also finds romance with an abused fellow addict, Charlie Standers (Kathy Baker), and understanding with his Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor (M. Emmet Walsh)(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Summer Catch</title>
    <desc lang="en">This blend of sports and youthful romantic comedy is from director Michael Tollin, who previously produced the sports drama Varsity Blues (1999). Freddie Prinze Jr. stars as Ryan Dunne, a ballplayer who's spending the summer as a pitcher for the famed, highly prestigious Cape Cod League, a non-professional farm team that has turned out numerous baseball legends. Ryan's under special pressure on a number of fronts. He's the first local boy to earn a slot in the league in years, and his blue-collar status earns him the enmity of a hot-shot college teammate, Eric Van Leemer (Corey Pearson). Although he's backed up by his best friend and team catcher Billy Brubaker (Matthew Lillard), Ryan adds more stress to his life by embarking on an affair with a beautiful, wealthy young Vassar graduate, Tenley Parrish (Jessica Biel), who's spending the summer on the Cape with her parents. Tenley is facing her own crisis as her father (Bruce Davison) pressures her to move to San Francisco and work with her uncle, though she'd rather remain in the East and become an architect. Summer Catch is the third onscreen teaming of Prinze and Lillard, and also stars Brian Dennehy, Wilmer Valderrama, Jason Gedrick, Fred Ward, and Brittany Murphy(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A dystopian fantasy adventure based on an unusually faithful adaptation of the highly regarded graphic novel by Alan Moore, directed by Zach Snyder. It is 1985 and Richard Nixon continues his tenure in the White House, massively popular with the electorate following his crushing defeat of the VIet Cong. However, it seems that the American public have fallen out of love with their superheroes, one of whom, Dr Manhattan, was largely responsible for the winning the VIetnam War. Now, he and his fellow crime-fighters are regarded as reprehensible vigilantes and have been banned by law. But, when one of their number - the vile, ironically named Comedian - is murdered, the former heroes begin to re-emerge from the shadows to investigate. They discover that a terrifying plan is afoot..(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The chef heads to the house of the founding father of Impressionism, Claude Monet, in Giverny, where he wastes no time in walking over the famous Japanese bridge to gaze at the water lillies. With his tour of the iconic garden complete, James sets up his mobile kitchen to cook a dish of crab and dulse, inspired by Monet's need to provide large meals for the brood of eight children he had with his second wife. He also takes a peek inside Monet's kitchen, and samples a pike dish served up by local chef Eric Guerin. A trip to a nearby orchard affords James the chance to prepare apple doughnuts, before he returns hope to cook Normandy tart - a local pudding - and an inventive omelette.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">New series. Documentary, charting the work of the men and women who toil behind the scenes on the M25, one of the busiest motorways in Britain. The series begins as traffic officers Simon and Gary deal with a four-car pile-up blocking two lanes. Delays mean the recovery trucks are late arriving on the scene, and as tensions rise, the officers face an uncomfortable wait. Meanwhile, the Northern Control Room, operator Emily is under pressure as rush-hour heats up, and maintenance workers Jack and Jamie face the unenviable task of clearing a layby of rubbish - and human waste - left behind by lorry drivers.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Secret Life of Dogs</title>
    <sub-title lang="en">We Are Family.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The documentary exploring the relationship between humans and dogs concludes, as narrator Martin Clunes offers an insight into the science behind the close bond people form with their canine companions. While dogs are said to share more than 99 per cent of their DNA with grey wolves, recent research has indicated that this link might actually be the key to why dogs have become the perfect family pet. The pack mentality of their lupine ancestors remains in domestic dogs, inspiring what seems to be a fierce loyalty to their human families, and Martin highlights real life instances where this instinct has prompted dogs to undertake remarkable feats. These include the story of Pero, the Welsh sheepdog who was taken to work on a farm 400 miles away from his `human pack', but still managed to find his way home, and Sako, the king shepherd who saved his owner's life after a devastating road accident left him stranded and injured in the Canadian wilderness. Last in the series.(n)</desc>

As the series opens, Priscilla White is a Liverpool typist with dreams of escaping the office and becoming a singer. It looks like her chance has come when she meets songwriter Bobby Willis, who claims to be in the music industry - so she's less than impressed to later discover his flash car is hired and he actually works in a bakery. Despite this inauspicious start, Cilla agrees to let him manage her, but will their arrangement still stand after her friends, a local band by the name of the Beatles, help her land an audition with genuine impresario Brian Epstein? Aneurin Barnard, Ed Stoppard and John Henshaw also star.(n)</desc>

The re-emergence of impresario Brian Epstein then propels her career to greater heights, but this is quickly followed by a new low when her first record fails to set the charts alight, despite being written by two local lads called John Lennon and Paul McCartney. Epstein suggests a change of direction, persuading the singer to take a gamble on the ballad Anyone Who Had a Heart, against her future husband's advice.

    <desc lang="en">It looks like Cilla has put that early botched audition and those disappointing record sales behind her as, following the success of Anyone Who Had a Heart, her new single You're My World becomes her second number one. However, while she may have conquered the UK charts, can she follow in the footsteps of her old mates the Beatles and crack America? The signs aren't looking good, and just to add to the pressure, her relationship with Bobby is becoming increasingly tumultuous. But as her manager Brian Epstein's private life starts to spiral out of control, it seems there could be an even bigger threat to Cilla's new-found success. The concluding instalment of Jeff Pope's biopic charting Cilla Black's rise to fame, starring Sheridan Smith, Aneurin Barnard and Ed Stoppard.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Coyote Army. Masters of stealth and hardwired to survive, coyotes have colonized many of the sprawling urban habitats of North America. Abundant food and protection from predators have allowed this adaptable animal to not only survive but thrive in our human world. While usually skittish, attacks on small pets have become more frequent. And in rare cases, these cunning predators attack humans. In California, a 2-year-old girl was dragged from a playground by a coyote. She survived, but Taylor Mitchell, a young woman hiking in Nova Scotia, was not so lucky. Now join researchers, scientists, trappers, and police officers as they try to determine the best ways to stay safe when living amongst these clever canines(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Pigzilla. Australia is being over-run by an invader. At as many as twenty-three million strong, feral pigs have already caused untold damage, and further destruction is inevitable if they're not stopped. Highly intelligent, hardy, and adaptable feral pigs are thriving in the land down-under. Here, they're endangering native species, spreading disease, destroying farmland, and even attacking people. Deliberately introduced by humans centuries ago, now it's up to humans to keep their populations in check. But that's easier said than done. So scientists and citizens are now resorting to a range of methods to defend their country. Join Nat Geo WILD as we tag along with the people who are defending Australia from this dangerous invader(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The arrest of a Turkish girl who has been working illegally leads Ucos to reopen the case of Richard Gibson, a pub landlord who died in a fire in 2009. The original investigation concluded Gibson's death was probably suicide due to his dire financial situation, but the detectives have some questions about the pub's live-in barmaid, who disappeared on the night of the blaze. Could widowed landlady Joanne, pub regular Jason, or the dead man's best friend David, who happens to have a sideline in passing off his British-produced sparkling wine as French champagne, supply them with any answers? While the case tests the team's brain power, Sasha is also keen to raise their fitness levels as she signs them up for a five-a-side football competition. Phil Davis, Niamh Cusack and Tom Georgeson guest star.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Architect and TV personality Dermot Bannon explores the island of Inishturk, nine miles off the coast of Co Mayo. He begins his journey from the pier at Roonagh Quay on Ireland's mainland as he takes a ferry to the island that is home to less than 100 residents. On arrival, he is joined by Danny O'Toole, and the pair take one of two trails to explore the sights, including the Spirit of Place sculpture that was designed by Travis Price. The next day, Dermot meets Gerry McCloskey to explore the south of the island, beginning at Portdoon pier, which was once supposedly a secret base for pirates.(n)</desc>

Claudio Ranieri's Foxes defied all the odds last season to claim a sensational first-ever Premier League trophy.

They will be hoping to put that behind them in this encounter and continue their debut foray in European football's major competition. With analysis from Liam Brady and commentary by George Hamilton.(n)</desc>

Nick Halsey (Ferrell) was once a successful salesman with a happy marriage, but years of drinking are finally catching up with him, as he's fired from his job and his wife has decided she's had enough. Nick's wife has kicked him out of the house and moved all his possessions onto their front lawn; hoping retain a bit of dignity and maybe raise some cash as he plots his next move, Nick puts a yard sale sign on his stuff and tries to convince the neighbors (and the cops) that he's simply selling some junk he doesn't need anymore. As Nick makes believe he isn't homeless in between beers, he strikes up a friendship with a kid from the neighborhood (Christopher Jordan Wallace), tries to reconnect with a girl he loved in high school (Laura Dern), and bonds with his neighbor Samantha (Rebecca Hall), who is pregnant and struggling to get by while her husband is away on business. Based on a short story by Raymond Carver, Everything Must Go was the first feature film from director and screenwriter Dan Rush(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Fast Times at Ridgemont High</title>
    <desc lang="en">Back in the late 1970s, author Cameron Crowe banked upon his youthful appearance to pose as a teen-aged high school student. The results of his hands-on research was the revelatory book Fast Times at Ridgemont High, which went on to spectacular success as a theatrical feature. The sociological inner lining of Crowe's book was sacrificed in favor of standard teen-movie dialogue and Animal House-style comedy, but the film is impossible to dislike, and it spawned a legion of future imitators. Ostensibly, the main characters are brother and sister Jennifer Jason Leigh and Judge Reinhold. However, the real breakthrough star is Sean Penn as the perpetually zoned-out Jeff Spicoli. It is Penn who has the film's most famous scene, wherein the decorum of teacher Hand (Ray Walston)'s classroom is interrupted by a pizza delivery. Fast Times at Ridgemont High was spun off into a TV series, the short-lived 1986 weekly Fast Times(n)</desc>

His larger-than-life persona and performances are fuelled by a passion for theatre and storytelling. This candid profile reveals the man and his music through his own testimony and from the accounts of those closest to him. Meat Loaf's life story is one of epic proportions - he survived a childhood of domestic violence only to face years of record company rejection, before eventually finding global fame. Along the way he experienced bankruptcy, health scares, bust-ups and one of the greatest comebacks of all time. All this and more is explored in the film, which features behind-the-scenes footage of his recent Las Vegas residency, plus plans for a new album featuring songs by Jim Steinman(n)</desc>

When one of Axle's products turns out to be dangerous and causes several thousand customers to lose a finger, he loses his fortune and spends eight years in prison for gross negligence. Back on the street, Axle is broke but determined to find a way back to the top, though he's just a bit more humble than he used to be and wants to win back the love of his daughter, Claire (Camilla Belle), whom he neglected as a child, and his ex-wife (Virginia Madsen). Things go badly for Axle on his first day working at a big-box discount store, and he's left with little alternative than to ask Claire to let him stay with her; she and her roommate, Fibbi (Heather Graham), aren't so sure this is a good idea, but they grudgingly agree and end up helping Axle in his bid to redeem himself.

    <title lang="en">Melinda and Melinda</title>
    <desc lang="en">While Woody Allen has long fused comedy and drama in his films, he embraces the two styles in a new and unusual way in this feature. Sy (Wallace Shawn) is enjoying dinner with some friends when they begin debating the nature of the tragic and the humorous. Sy, observing that a very fine line separates the two, decides to demonstrate this notion by showing how the same essential story can be either funny or sad depending on the way certain elements are handled; for the rest of the film, we jump back and forth between two versions of the story of Melinda (Radha Mitchell), a young woman with some serious problems in her life. In the tragic version, Melinda crashes a dinner party thrown by old friends Laurel (Chloë Sevigny) and Lee (Jonny Lee Miller). When she arrives, Melinda is distraught and under the influence of pills and alcohol, much to the annoyance of Lee, an actor hoping to impress a producer who is one of his guests. After a bad breakup with her husband, Melinda lost custody of her children and came to New York City, where she became involved with Ellis Moonsong (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a handsome and well-mannered composer whose promises to her proved to be worthless. Meanwhile, on the funny side of town, Melinda shows up dazed and confused at the home of Susan (Amanda Peet) and Hobie (Will Ferrell), who are in the midst of a dinner party. Learning about the sad state of Melinda's love life after divorcing her husband and losing custody of her children, Susan decides to play Cupid and fix her friend up with a well-to-do dentist. However, neither Susan nor Melinda are aware that there is another man deeply interested in the troubled divorcée -- Hobie. Melinda and Melinda also features Josh Brolin, Vinessa Shaw, and noted theatrical director Gene Saks(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">An undercover CIA agent attempting to thwart the sale of a nuclear weapon is forced to do battle with a dangerous horde of murderous arms dealers in this explosive action entry directed by Hong Kong veteran Po-Chih Leong and starring American action icon Wesley Snipes. Sonni Griffith (Snipes) is en route to Poland to expose a notorious arms dealer when the dealer is tipped off to the agent's identity and Griffith subsequently ends up in a prison cell. Soon released by the CIA with a mission to escort beautiful Russian Nadia (Silvia Colloca) back to the United States, Griffith quickly learns that the very same arms dealer he sought to wipe out is willing to kill for a valuable secret known only to his strong-willed charge. It seems that Nadia is the only one who knows the location of the hidden 30 million dollars that would allow Griffith's nemesis to purchase a nuclear bomb. Now with nothing to lose and everything to fight for, Griffith and Nadia must take on the world's most deadly arms dealer in order to save millions of lives(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Fresh</title>
    <desc lang="en">Justifiably hailed as one of the most powerful and innovative films of 1994, screenwriter Boaz Yakin's directorial debut offers a wrenching portrait of a 12-year-old African American boy struggling to survive in a Brooklyn ghetto. The story unspools slowly with a sprawling, nearly silent panorama of the boy's daily life. Fresh (Sean Nelson in his feature film debut) is first seen walking to school, and but for stopping to pick up a delivery from a local drug dealer, he seems like any other boy. While Fresh may appear young and inexperienced, one look into his intelligent, sensitive but street-hardened eyes shows that he is old beyond his years. Shrewd, hard-working and loyal, Fresh is a taciturn youth, and this earns him the respect of the rival drug dealers for whom he works. Both kingpins have become his mentors, and he seems destined to become just like them. Sometimes, Fresh goes to Washington Square to play chess for money. He is a remarkable player, but is no match for his beer-swilling, unemployable father (Samuel L. Jackson), a world class chess player who never had the chance to compete. A ruthless player, his father gives Fresh invaluable advice about the game's nature and ultimately about life itself. Those words come in handy when a schoolyard crisis prompts Fresh to began planning his cold-blooded, methodical escape from ghetto life. During the film, one waits for the stereotypes, the cartoonish two-dimensional characters, inevitable moralizing against an unjust, oppressive society, and the glorified, graphically violent action sequences punctuated by the pounding beat of angry rap music, but Fresh studiously avoids such cliches. The characters are three-dimensional and presented with little judgment; the drug lords are bad men, but they are also very human. His sister is on a ruinous road, but she is not a purely tragic victim. When violence occurs it is ingloriously swift and ugly. Percussionist Stuart Copeland's soundtrack subtly underscores the action(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Two. Season Three of Twilight Zone got off to a flying start with this episode, written and directed by Montgomery Pittman. Some five years after a devastating war that wiped out virtually all mankind, a pair of surviving soldiers from opposing armies confront each other in the deserted streets of a bombed-out city. Only the male soldier, played by Charles Bronson, has any dialogue; the female soldier, played by Elizabeth Montgomery, prefers to do her "talking" with a high-powered rifle. While the episode's ending is inevitable, the buildup to that ending takes a variety of unexpected twists and turns. Filmed on the old Hal Roach Studios backlot, "Two" originally aired September 15, 1961(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Repo Men</title>
    <desc lang="en">Writers Eric Garcia and Garrett Lerner team with director Miguel Sapochnik to adapt Garcia's novel about a repo man named Remy whose body has been constructed almost entirely of artificial organs.

When a professor specializing in stem-cell research is murdered, the detectives at first suspect that the killer was a pro-life zealot. It soon develops that the actual target for extermination was the professor's wife (also murdered in the attack), who was raising money and public awareness for Muslim women's rights. Ultimately, the clues lead to a young Muslim extremist who calls himself Mousah Salim, but who is actually an American named Greg Landen (Wil Horneff). In prosecuting the case, the lawyers try to ferret out the motivation behind Landen's wild-eyed fanaticism, with surprising results. Fred Dalton Thompson joins the cast as new DA Arthur Branch(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A struggling writer unlocks the full potential of his brain by taking a cutting-edge pharmaceutical, only to find that his newfound abilities have made him a target for some of the most greedy and dangerous men on the planet. Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) is an author without a novel. No matter how hard he tries, he just can't summon the inspiration to write a single word. That all changes when an old friend wanders back into Eddie's life, and opens his eyes to a powerful new drug called NZT. The moment Eddie takes NZT, his brain begins functioning at 100 percent, giving him the ability to quickly recall every event in his life down to the smallest detail, learn new languages in a flash, and harness the untapped power of complex mathematical equations. But when Eddie's supply of NZT runs out, the party is over. Of course, it doesn't take Eddie long to make a mint on Wall Street, and when he does, it draws the attention of Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro), one of the world's most powerful and prominent businessmen. With Eddie's help, Carl plots to arbitrate a complex corporate merger that will shake the establishment to its very core. Just as the deal is about to be brokered, however, some dangerous characters discover Eddie's secret and come gunning for his dwindling supply of medicine. Now, if Eddie can just endure the debilitating side effects of NZT long enough to run for his life, he may just survive to see another day(n)</desc>
