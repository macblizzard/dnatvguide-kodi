    <title lang="en">Who Wants to Be a Millionaire</title>
    <desc lang="en">Although the once-hot game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? had lost its luster as a prime-time ABC offering, the producers felt that there was enough life left in the property to warrant a Monday-through-Friday syndicated version. Taking over from the earlier series' host Regis Philbin was Meredith Vieira of The View. To make certain that the series would not be bankrupted after its first week on the air, the questions posed to contestants were considerably harder than those on the prime-time incarnation. Also, the famous "fastest finger" round was eliminated, taking some of the pressure off the contestants when they struggled to come up with answers. The most noteworthy change from the original version was the absence of Regis Philbin's familiar catchphrases: One would never hear Meredith Vieira chime in with the legendary "Is that your final answer?" The syndicated Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? was launched on September 16, 2002(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Winter Wipeout</title>
    <desc lang="en">Richard Hammond presents this chilly version of Total Wipeout, which sees the contestants wrapping up warm to tackle a snow-covered course with winter-themed obstacles and seasonal challenges. They must manoeuvre themselves past Granny's House, watching out for the angry dog nipping at their ankles and a front door guaranteed to smack them in the face. They then cling onto the ski lift to avoid plunging into the icy waters, before riding the conveyor belt that throws them onto those old Wipeout favourites, the big red balls. Amanda Byram laughs it up at the side of the course.(n)</desc>

Wealthy and well-connected, Tom Capano was still subjected to the torments of the heart. When an affair with Anne Marie Fahey ended badly, he snapped. After murdering his ex-lover, Capano dumped her body in the water, a seemingly clever move. However, Capano never counted on the guilty conscience of his own brother to secure his undoing. The police kept the jealous boyfriend under surveillance until they had the sibling's confession as accomplice. Surprisingly, at trial, Capano himself admitted to removing the body. But, he held onto the claim that Fahey was killed by someone else. Capano was convicted and sentenced to death(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Dead Woman Walking: The Karla Faye Tucker Story. This documentary, part of the American Justice series from A&amp;E, examines the Texas death penalty case of Karla Faye Walker. Narrated by American Justice host and producer Bill Kurtis, this episode goes inside the investigation of the two murders that Walker and her boyfriend Daniel Ryan Garrett committed. The trial of Walker is shown through exclusive footage. After the conviction, American Justice follows her through her daily life, showing her prison surroundings and talking with her about her crimes. Sentenced to death, while Walker was waiting to be executed, she became a born-again Christian. Her lawyers used this transformation as leverage to try to get her death sentence reduced to life in prison. Their attempts were unsuccessful and Walker was killed by lethal injection in February 1998. American Justice also shows interviews with lawyers and law enforcement professionals who knew Walker(n)</desc>

Tony Robinson and his team of archaeologists head to Buckinghamshire to meet her and see the finds. The experts believe they have may uncover the remains of a medieval building, probably belonging to the infamous Cheyne family. The clan's various members were accused of extortion, torture and assault, and rigged the local parliamentary election when they arrived in the town - before going on to become one of Britain's most respectable families.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Whale</title>
    <desc lang="en">Jonas Armstrong stars in this drama about the fateful last voyage of the 19th-century Nantucket whaling ship Essex, which was attacked and sunk by a sperm whale in 1820, leaving the crew struggling to survive in three smaller boats. Stranded in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, the men must decide whether to head for the nearest islands, 1,000 miles downwind to the west, or set out on an epic journey of almost 3,000 miles to reach the South American mainland. Seen through the eyes of 14-year-old cabin boy Thomas Nickerson, the incident went on to inspire Herman Melville's book, Moby-Dick. Newcomer Charles Furness plays the young Nickerson, with West Wing and Apocalypse Now star Martin Sheen as the older man, while the crew includes Paul Kaye, Adam Rayner and Jolyon Coy.(n)</desc>

Cheetahs use their unmatched speed to solve this problem, while lions have learned to use desert storms to conceal their approach and caracals are able to blend into the tall dry grass. The programme also features footage of bald eagles stalking snow geese, hot rod ants who rely on the sun to kill their food, and headlight beetles that lure termites to their death with an eerie glow.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Schindler's List</title>
    <desc lang="en">Steven Spielberg's masterwork deals with the Holocaust, but the Holocaust on a personal level -- how one man's morality and humanity changes in the face of unmitigated horror. As the film's tagline aptly sums it up: "Whoever saves one life, saves the entire world." The film begins in Krakow, Poland in 1939. Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), an imposing, well-dressed bon-vivant is seen buying drinks and caviar for Nazi officers, who permit him to open up a clay-pot factory, enlisting cheap labor provided by Jewish refugees. Schindler asks Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), a Jewish accountant, to help him obtain backing for the factory. By 1941, the Jewish community has been herded into the Ghetto, and the elders agree to back Schindler, reasoning that having a job might guarantee the Jews a reprieve from death in the concentration camps. But, by 1943, the Ghetto is being liquidated, and the remaining residents are brought to the Plaszow Forced Labor Camp. The commandant, Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) is a cold-blooded Nazi sadist, who at the same time is attracted to Jewish inmate Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz), whom he makes his maid. When the time came for his unpaid Jewish workers to be sent to their deaths, Schindler was able to rescue over a thousand of them by placing them on his special list of "essential" workers and by befriending Goeth and using his friendship to campaign for their reprieve(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A town called Redemption in the old west isn't big enough for two hot-shot gunslingers, so mad John Herod calls in all the crack shots from miles around to enter a deadly knockout tournament for a mouth-watering prize. He seems keen to eliminate preacherman Cort but female gunslinger Ellen saves his life. As the contest progresses and the rising bodycount embraces all the dispensable characters - including Herod's cocky son - the reasons for the enmity between Herod and Cort and between Herod and Ellen become apparent(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Gladiator</title>
    <desc lang="en">Gladiator is the kind of boxing movie that goes that extra mile -- a self-loathing boxing saga that relishes in bare-knuckled sucker punches, illegal eye-rubs, and gentlemen boxers who obey the Marquis of Queensbury rules by drop-kicking opponents when the are not only down but unconscious. James Marshall plays Tommy Riley, a Windy City high school student conned into participating in the illegal underground boxing arenas of the South Side of Chicago. In high school, Tommy was a prize boxer, and this skill comes in handy when his Father (John Heard) runs up a large gambling debt. When a sleazy boxing manager (Robert Loggia) spots Tommy defending himself during recess, he offers him quick money to box. Tommy, although he hates the sport, readily agrees, thinking his winnings will help his father pay off his debts. He quickly comes under the thumb of unscrupulous boxing promoter Horn (Brian Dennehy), who is involved in fight-fixing and dirty fighting. Manipulating the odds and exploiting his boxers make Horn rich and more venal. In the rancid environment, Tommy befriends another fighter, Lincoln (Cuba Gooding Jr.), a black fighter who sees fighting as his way out of poverty. Inevitably, Horn arranges for the two friends to duke it out in the ring together(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Miracle on Evergreen Terrace</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Miracle on Evergreen Terrace. It's Christmas Eve in Springfield, and Bart Simpson (voice of Nancy Cartwright) can barely contain his excitement at the prospect of a big stack of presents. Waking up before the rest on the family on the big day, Bart starts opening gifts without them, but after getting a toy fire truck, he ironically sets fire to the Simpsons' artificial Christmas tree, destroying all the gifts under it in the process. Bart is able to hide the evidence before anyone can see him, but when Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta), Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) and Lisa (voice of Yeardley Smith) ask what happened to their presents, Bart lies and says a burglar made off with them. Homer and Marge report the robbery to the police, and when newsman Kent Brockman (voice of Harry Shearer) puts the story of the Yuletide theft on television, the city opens up its collective heart (and wallet) and the family receive a windfall of fifteen thousand dollars. Homer impulsively spends the money on a new car, but he wrecks it while driving home, and Bart finally tells the truth about what happened to the tree and the presents. When the people of Springfield learn the truth, they turn on the Simpson family until Marge pledges to find a way to pay them back for their generosity. Featuring a voice cameo from Alex Trebek as himself, "Miracle on Evergreen Terrace" was first aired on December 21, 1997(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">It is 10 years since Geraldine Granger became the first female vicar of Dibley, and the villagers are keen to celebrate the anniversary with a party.

Festive special from 2004, guest starring Rachel Hunter.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Ghost World</title>
    <desc lang="en">Filmmaker Terry Zwigoff, who enjoyed breakthrough success with his 1994 documentary Crumb, shifts gears as he examines the lives of two young women on the verge of leaving their adolescence behind in his first dramatic feature. Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) are two close friends who've just graduated from high school, and are trying to decide what to do with their lives. Enid is a dark-haired arch cynic who is tired of living at home with her ineffectual dad (Bob Balaban) and his annoyingly perky girlfriend Maxine (Teri Garr), while Rebecca is prettier and a bit cheerier, but no more certain about her future. While the two girls have vague plans of getting an apartment together, they seem content to while away their summer hanging out and indulging in their shared infatuation with Josh (Brad Renfro), a friend from school who works at a convenience store and doesn't seem to be especially attracted to either of them. Enid discovers that in order to get her diploma, she'll have to take an additional class over the summer, where she winds up studying art with Roberta (Illeana Douglas), who is determined to encourage Enid's creative impulses, whether Enid likes it or not. More significantly, Enid meets Seymour (Steve Buscemi), a geeky record collector more than twice her age, and while they would seem to have little in common (and Rebecca thinks he's a creep), Enid discovers a kindred spirit in fellow misfit Seymour, who shares her disgust with the world around them, and a relationship begins to develop between the two. Ghost World is based on the award-winning graphic novel by comic artist Daniel Clowes, who also wrote the film's screenplay(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Ghost World</title>
    <desc lang="en">Filmmaker Terry Zwigoff, who enjoyed breakthrough success with his 1994 documentary Crumb, shifts gears as he examines the lives of two young women on the verge of leaving their adolescence behind in his first dramatic feature. Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) are two close friends who've just graduated from high school, and are trying to decide what to do with their lives. Enid is a dark-haired arch cynic who is tired of living at home with her ineffectual dad (Bob Balaban) and his annoyingly perky girlfriend Maxine (Teri Garr), while Rebecca is prettier and a bit cheerier, but no more certain about her future. While the two girls have vague plans of getting an apartment together, they seem content to while away their summer hanging out and indulging in their shared infatuation with Josh (Brad Renfro), a friend from school who works at a convenience store and doesn't seem to be especially attracted to either of them. Enid discovers that in order to get her diploma, she'll have to take an additional class over the summer, where she winds up studying art with Roberta (Illeana Douglas), who is determined to encourage Enid's creative impulses, whether Enid likes it or not. More significantly, Enid meets Seymour (Steve Buscemi), a geeky record collector more than twice her age, and while they would seem to have little in common (and Rebecca thinks he's a creep), Enid discovers a kindred spirit in fellow misfit Seymour, who shares her disgust with the world around them, and a relationship begins to develop between the two. Ghost World is based on the award-winning graphic novel by comic artist Daniel Clowes, who also wrote the film's screenplay(n)</desc>

Though strictly small potatoes, scam-man Franklin Hatchett (Tucker) attracts the attention of the TV anchorman James Russell (Charlie Sheen) while running his latest con at a carwash. Shortly after refusing an interview with Russell, Franklin ends up jailed. He manages to escape when a transfer bus is hijacked. Handcuffed to a French jewel thief involved in the attack, Franklin is dragged along. He escapes, but his troubles are not over, for he quickly learns that he is the accused perpetrator of the hijacking. When all is said and done, Franklin finds himself pursued by the cops, the thieves, loan sharks, and an irate pregnant girlfriend. In desperation he goes to Russell and makes a deal. Russell brings Franklin to his pre-wedding party to meet his fiance Grace Ciprani (Heather Locklear). Franklin creates big trouble when he tells her father Guy (Paul Sorvino) that he is Vic Damone, Jr., son of Vic Damone and Diahann Carroll. Guy accepts this and gives Franklin a real Italian welcome. But though he may feel safe for the moment, Franklin's troubles are just beginning and before the story ends, he and the hapless Russell are involved in gun fights, car chases and a final showdown at the Los Angeles Coliseum(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Great Muppet Caper is the second Muppet film and it is considerably more complex than its predecessor, The Muppet Movie, which was essentially just a road movie. As the film begins, Kermit the Frog and Fozzie Bear are reporters who have failed to bag a story of a London jewel heist, which happened under their watch. The real criminals managed to escape and frame Miss Piggy as the thief. Kermit, Fozzie and the Great Gonzo set out on a mission to solve the mystery and track down the criminals who stole the Baseball Diamond. There are fewer star cameos and songs in The Great Muppet Caper than in The Muppet Movie, although appearances from John Cleese and Charles Grodin are particularly memorable(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Father Christmas's ne'er-do-well son finds himself in hot water when he lands in jail - just as he's supposed to be mastering the art of delivering presents to wide-eyed youngsters around the world.

The anti-Christmas spirited Susan is assigned to help Chris get bail, but she refuses to believe he is the son of Santa or that Santa even exists. So with Christmas Eve fast approaching, trapped with no elf, no magic sack of goodies, Chris is in a race against time to keep Christmas on schedule(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">War Elephants</title>
    <desc lang="en">Join brother-and-sister-team Bob and Joyce Poole as they travel to Gorongosa National Park in Mozambique on a simple but dangerous (some would say crazy) mission: to confront traumatized, charging elephants; teach them not to attack people; and convince them that after 16 years of civil war, poaching and destruction, the humans in the park now come in peace and offer protection, not bloodshed and terror. But to get their message across, Bob and Joyce must put themselves in harm's way. Some say elephants never forget, and in Gorongosa National Park, they seem to remember the bullets that killed their family members and the terror that destroyed their culture. Elephant expert and scientist Joyce Poole has been studying these magnificent giants for over 30 years, while Bob, an acclaimed cinematographer, has been filming them for just as long. Their plan is a complex mixture of science and what some might consider insanity: Bob and Joyce will drive directly into the path of charging Gorongosa elephants - and refuse to back down. The hope is to habituate the elephants to people, prove that tourists are not a threat, and hopefully, not get trampled in the process. But when six tons of angry elephant comes charging straight at their vehicle, will Bob and Joyce be able to stay put, or will fear take over? If these elephants really cannot forget the past, the question becomes: Can they forgive?(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Surf's Up</title>
    <desc lang="en">A surfing penguin currently riding the wave of success enters his first professional competition in this computer-animated family-oriented comedy from directors Chris Buck and Ash Brannon. Cody Maverick (Shia LaBeouf) may be a relative amateur when it comes to hanging ten, but he's sure he has what it takes to surf his way to superstardom. With a little help from his cantankerous King Penguin mentor, ex-surfing legend Big Z (Jeff Bridges), and a little encouragement from star Pen Gu Island lifeguard Lani (Zooey Deschanel), there may be hope for this tuxedo-clad wave twister after all. James Woods, Jane Krakowski, Michael McKean, Jon Heder, Mario Cantone, and Brian Benben all lend their voices to this inspirational tale that proves anything is possible when you put your heart and mind to it(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Motorway Patrol</title>
    <desc lang="en">Documentary following members of the New Zealand highway patrol as they witness some of the best and worst behaviour on the nation's motorways. The series is centred around the roads of Auckland, the country's largest urban area, and features motoring chaos including major traffic collisions, escaped animals and pedestrians on busy roads. There is also footage of drivers falling asleep at the wheel, overloaded vehicles and suspects caught with illegal substances - plus a host of excuses as the people pulled over try to persuade officers they have not done anything wrong.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Amy is battling morning sickness, so the last thing she needs is to be caught in the middle of Raf and Harry's ongoing clash of egos. Guy realises that having Harry around isn't doing her any good and offers to transfer the junior doctor - but she realises she has to deal with him in her own way. Mo is basking in her celebrity status while dismissing her sister's career aspirations, although she is forced to rethink things when a star-struck patient turns violent.

    <title lang="en">Attenborough &amp; the Giant Dinosaur</title>
    <desc lang="en">The story of how more than 220 dinosaur bones were found in the Argentinean desert, which were found to have come from a previously undiscovered species, which is the largest land dwelling animal known to have existed. David Attenborough visits the archaeological dig and a laboratory where the remains are being cleaned and analysed with lead scientist Dr Diego Pol and evolutionary biologist Ben Garrod, and meets animators, model-makers, paleontologists and anatomy experts who are working to reconstruct what the 37 metre-long creature would have looked like.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Panto</title>
    <desc lang="en">The pantomime world comes under the spotlight in this festive comedy drama co-written by and starring stand-up star John Bishop. The funnyman plays Lewis Loud, a DJ for Morecambe FM, who is about to make his stage debut as Jack the Lad in Dick Whittington, alongside token soap star Tamsin (Sheridan Smith), who he has fallen for during rehearsals. But when Lewis's ex-wife delivers his son to the stage door, he realises he must take his fatherly duties very seriously - which is easier said than done when you're surrounded by chaos and ego, in the shape of veteran actor Johnny, ambitious actress-producer Di and accident-prone 1990s chart star Chesney Hawkes, keen to prove there is more to him than The One and Only. Co-starring Samantha Spiro, Mark Benton, Kaye Wragg, Michael Cochrane and Ami Metcalf. Co-scripted by Jonathan Harvey (Coronation Street, Gimme Gimme Gimme).(n)</desc>

The malevolent force known as The Krugen knows well that the owner of these objects will reap ultimate power, because by obtaining the magical mirror once owned by the Evil Queen who tormented Snow White, they were able to herald the arrival of the Dark Ages.

    <title lang="en">Avengers: Age of Ultron</title>
    <desc lang="en">This sequel to the smash-hit comic-book epic The Avengers finds the iconic superhero team dealing with a threat of their own making: a sentient robot called Ultron (voice of James Spader), who was originally designed as part of a peacekeeping program. Since the events of the last film, Captain America (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) have been working to take down various cells of a secret society of villains known as HYDRA. Their zeal to make the world a better, safer place inspires Tony Stark, genius billionaire and alter ego of Iron Man, to create Ultron in order to respond to additional threats that the Avengers aren't able to handle. Ultron, unfortunately, takes this directive way too seriously -- he believes that world peace can only be achieved by exterminating humanity, and he'll stop at nothing to accomplish this goal. The battle between the Avengers and Ultron is further complicated by the appearance of superpowered siblings Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), who ally themselves with the homicidal android. Samuel L. Jackson and Cobie Smulders co-star as, respectively, S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives Nick Fury and Maria Hill.

    <desc lang="en">This sequel to the smash-hit comic-book epic The Avengers finds the iconic superhero team dealing with a threat of their own making: a sentient robot called Ultron (voice of James Spader), who was originally designed as part of a peacekeeping program. Since the events of the last film, Captain America (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) have been working to take down various cells of a secret society of villains known as HYDRA. Their zeal to make the world a better, safer place inspires Tony Stark, genius billionaire and alter ego of Iron Man, to create Ultron in order to respond to additional threats that the Avengers aren't able to handle. Ultron, unfortunately, takes this directive way too seriously -- he believes that world peace can only be achieved by exterminating humanity, and he'll stop at nothing to accomplish this goal. The battle between the Avengers and Ultron is further complicated by the appearance of superpowered siblings Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), who ally themselves with the homicidal android. Samuel L. Jackson and Cobie Smulders co-star as, respectively, S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives Nick Fury and Maria Hill.

    <title lang="en">Cheaper by the Dozen 2</title>
    <desc lang="en">The jumbo-sized Baker family are back in this sequel to the 2003 box-office hit Cheaper by the Dozen. College football coach Tom Baker (Steve Martin) and his wife, author Kate Baker (Bonnie Hunt), have decided its time they took their sizable brood of 12 children on a summer vacation, and so they pack up the cars and take the kids to Lake Winnetka for some camping. Not all the kids are happy about this, but the one who is really annoyed turns out to be Tom, who discovers his old rival Jimmy Murtaugh (Eugene Levy) is also staying near the lake.

    <title lang="en">The Day After Tomorrow</title>
    <desc lang="en">Roland Emmerich's blockbuster stars Dennis Quaid as climatologist Jack Hall; a lone voice predicting that global warming will lead to a new ice age. He is ridiculed for his views, but his fears swiftly come true when a dramatic temperature rise in the Antarctic causes the world's weather to go mad, with tornadoes devastating Los Angeles, Britain literally flash-frozen and New York first inundated by floods and then overwhelmed by a killer cold snap. A few survivors, including Jack's son Sam, take refuge in a library and Jack sets out on a desperate mission to save them. The action-packed film (which won a BAFTA for its stunning special effects) may have compressed and dramatised the effects of global warming but, disturbingly, the basic science Emmerich uses in the film to advance the plot isn't that far removed from the increasing dangers the world faces today(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Invincible</title>
    <desc lang="en">Werner Herzog returned to dramatic filmmaking for the first time in a decade with this historical drama, based on a true story, about a man who rose to fame and fortune in 1932 as the Nazis rose to power in Germany, only to renounce his career in order to stand beside his people as a symbol of strength and resistance. Zishe (Jouko Ahola) is a Polish Jew, and a blacksmith's son, who lives in a small town in Finland. A giant of a man with remarkable physical strength, Zishe is discovered by Landwehr (Gustav Peter Wohler), a theatrical agent who believes a successful nightclub act can be built around this Polish Adonis. Landwehr brings Zishe to Berlin, where he lands a spot in the revue of a nightclub run by Hanussen (Tim Roth), a stage hypnotist who claims to be a Danish nobleman with psychic gifts. Hanussen is also a confirmed anti-Semite who is in cahoots with many of the leading members of the Nazi Party, who are becoming a political force to be reckoned with. Zishe's act, in which he performs feats of strength while costumed as a Roman soldier, becomes a great success, but when he falls for Marta (Anna Gourari), a pianist at the club, he discovers he has a rival for her affection -- Hanussen, who is her lover but is also physically abusive toward her. One night, while performing for an audience comprised of Hanussen's Nazi friends, Zishe reveals to the crowd that he is actually a Jew. He soon becomes a champion of the Jewish cause and a hero to his fellow Poles, but earns the wrath of Hanussen and his comrades in the process. As he has often done in the past, Werner Herzog aimed for realism in his casting for Invincible; Jouko Ahola, who plays the Polish strongman, is actually a champion weightlifter from Poland, while Anna Gourari is known to music aficionados as a gifted concert pianist(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Based on a true story, this drama was adapted from the life of Brandon Teena, born Teena Brandon, a woman who chose to live her life as a man and suffered tragic consequences as a result. In 1993, 20-year-old Brandon (Hilary Swank) leaves Lincoln, Nebraska for the nearby community of Falls City, where she sports a crew cut, favors jeans and boots, and is regarded as a man by most of the people in town. While Brandon's friend Lonny (Matt McGrath) warns her that sexual outsiders aren't looked upon kindly in Falls City, she develops a reputation for being something of a ladies' man, and is soon living with a single mother named Candace (Alicia Goranson). But when Brandon meets teenage Lana (Chloe Sevigny), the two become romantically involved almost immediately. Brandon makes friends with Lana's mother (Jeanetta Arnette) and a burly ex-con named John (Peter Sarsgaard). John and his buddy Tom (Brendan Sexton) run with a rough group of men who like to drink and carouse, and they accept Brandon as one of their own. However, when Brandon ends up in jail on a traffic violation, her secret comes out, and, while Lana stands by Brandon's side, John and Tom feel betrayed -- and their anger soon boils over into violence. A distinguished feature debut for director Kimberly Peirce, Boys Don't Cry was enthusiastically received in its showings at 1999 film festivals in Venice, Toronto, and New York(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The many emotional scars left by South Africa's history of institutionalized racism come under the microscope in this drama. As South Africa comes to terms with the legacy of apartheid, their government has created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, in which the perpetrators of racial violence and injustice must come face to face with their victims if they are to be forgiven for their crimes. Langston Whitfield (Samuel L. Jackson) is an African-American journalist who is assigned to cover these hearings by The Washington Post; Whitfield doubts the efficacy of this process, and sets out to interview Col. De Jager (Brendan Gleeson), a notorious former officer of the South African police who was famous for his violence against blacks in order to put this method to the test. While in South Africa, Whitfield meets Anna Malan (Juliette Binoche), an Afrikaner poet who is covering the hearing for a radio station and is both appalled and disturbed by the details of the violence inflicted against her countrymen. After striking up a friendship, Whitfield and Malan become romantically involved as they try to come to terms with their feelings about what they've learned. Also screened under the title Country of My Skull, In My Country was adapted from a book by South African author Antjie Krog(n)</desc>

But Tony Stark has a surprise up his sleeve in the form of four amazing teenagers who just might have the power to defeat Ultron once and for all. But will James (son of Captain America and Black Widow), Pym (son of Wasp and Giant Man), Torunn (daughter of Thor) and Azari (son of the Black Panther) truly be capable of defeating the villain who brought about the downfall of their powerful parents? As the battle gets underway and Hawkeye's sharp-shooting son leaps into the fray, the team realizes that they might stand a fighting chance if they can only track down the mission Hulk and encourage him to become a member of the team. Should they succeed in defeating Ultron, this group will forever be known as The Next Avengers(n)</desc>

In retaliation, she borrows 35 bucks and assembles her own Access series, "Vital Social Issues 'N' Stuff with KELLY", replete with a live band and a round table of female airheads. So successful is Kelly's video effort that a major network (no, not Fox) evinces interest in picking up the show for the Big Time. Katey Sagal (Peggy) does not appear in this episode, nor does Amanda Bearse (who served as director)show up in her familiar "Marcy D'Arcy" character--though Bearse can be fleetingly seen in the Access show "Short Haired Women in Banking." On the other hand, Matt LeBlanc makes a return appearance as Kelly Bundy's dimwitted male counterpart Vinnie Verducci(n)</desc>

Each witness reacts to the spectacle in a different manner, ranging from the married Curtis' brief tête-à-tête with a graduate student, Briscoe's lapse into drinking, and Kincaid's self-doubts over whether she can continue her work in the D.A.'s office. Things come to a shatteringly tragic climax for at least one of the four principals. This concluding episode of Law &amp; Order's sixth season represents the final series appearance of co-star Jill Hennessy, as well as an early TV gig for future Alias star Jennifer Garner(n)</desc>

Claire Kincaid (Jill Hennessy) was not immediately killed in the car accident which took her out of commission at the end of Season Five (though actress Hennessy would not return to the show, necessitating a later episode which confirmed beyond doubt that Kincaid was never going to come back). New to the D.A.'s office is Jamie Ross (Carey Lowell), an ambitious young woman whose approach to her job does not always meet with the approval of her partner Jack McCoy (Sam Waterston). In the season's first episode, Ross intends to use a gruesomely graphic audiotape to put the noose around the neck of carjacker-murderer Fernando Salva (Victor Sierra)(n)</desc>
