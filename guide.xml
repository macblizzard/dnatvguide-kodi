Now cameras return to find how Sharon has shed 14 stone. But having started to put the pounds on again, she is considering a second procedure.

    <title lang="en">I Am Legend</title>
    <desc lang="en">Adapted from acclaimed author Richard Matheson's influential novelette of the same name, Constantine director Francis Lawrence's I Am Legend follows the last man on Earth as he struggles to survive while fending off the infected survivors of a devastating vampiric plague. A brilliant scientist who raced to discover a cure for the man-made virus as humanity came crumbling down all around him, Robert Neville (Will Smith) was inexplicably immune to the highly contagious superbug. Now the entire population of New York City -- and perhaps the world -- has been transformed into carnivorous bloodsuckers that fear the light and live solely to spread their contagion to any remaining living creature that crosses their path. It's been three years since civilization came to an end, and the loneliness has taken a devastating toll on Neville. By day he scours the city for food and supplies while sending out desperate radio messages in hopes that someone might respond, and by night he attempts to find a way to reverse the effects of the virus by experimenting with his own blood. But time is running out for Neville as the legions of infected watch his every move from the safety of the shadows, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. They, too, long to learn the secret that lurks in Neville's blood, though they will have to take caution while attempting to procure it because Neville will sooner die attempting to slay every last one of them than willingly giving up a single drop. Previously adapted for the screen in the 1964 Vincent Price frightener The Last Man on Earth and the 1971 Charlton Heston action film The Omega Man, Matheson's novelette also served as the inspiration for George A. Romero's groundbreaking zombie classic Night of the Living Dead(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Ghost World</title>
    <desc lang="en">Filmmaker Terry Zwigoff, who enjoyed breakthrough success with his 1994 documentary Crumb, shifts gears as he examines the lives of two young women on the verge of leaving their adolescence behind in his first dramatic feature. Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) are two close friends who've just graduated from high school, and are trying to decide what to do with their lives. Enid is a dark-haired arch cynic who is tired of living at home with her ineffectual dad (Bob Balaban) and his annoyingly perky girlfriend Maxine (Teri Garr), while Rebecca is prettier and a bit cheerier, but no more certain about her future. While the two girls have vague plans of getting an apartment together, they seem content to while away their summer hanging out and indulging in their shared infatuation with Josh (Brad Renfro), a friend from school who works at a convenience store and doesn't seem to be especially attracted to either of them. Enid discovers that in order to get her diploma, she'll have to take an additional class over the summer, where she winds up studying art with Roberta (Illeana Douglas), who is determined to encourage Enid's creative impulses, whether Enid likes it or not. More significantly, Enid meets Seymour (Steve Buscemi), a geeky record collector more than twice her age, and while they would seem to have little in common (and Rebecca thinks he's a creep), Enid discovers a kindred spirit in fellow misfit Seymour, who shares her disgust with the world around them, and a relationship begins to develop between the two. Ghost World is based on the award-winning graphic novel by comic artist Daniel Clowes, who also wrote the film's screenplay(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A teenage boy raised by gorillas in Africa falls for a pretty conservationist following a chance meeting in the jungle, but finds their romance threatened by a menacing Silverback, and a scheming capitalist in search of a new energy source in this animated adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs' classic tale. John Greystoke, Jr. was just a toddler when he accompanied his adventurous mother and father on a journey into Africa in search of a mineral that could revolutionize the energy industry. That trip turns tragic, however, when their helicopter crashes in a race to escape a massive storm, leaving young John the sole survivor. Raised from that day forward by a motherly gorilla named Kala, the boy, now named Tarzan, quickly integrates into the family of primates. But alpha male Silverback Tablat refuses to accept Tarzan's presence, viewing him as a direct threat to the clan. Nearly a decade later, Tarzan encounters beautiful Jane Porter, and begins to long for human contact. When Jane returns to the jungle accompanied by smooth-talking entrepreneur William Clayton a few years later, her relationship with Tarzan is rekindled. But while Clayton has ostensibly come to the jungle to support Jane's conservationist endeavors, he's actually searching for the very same energy source once sought by Tarzan's father, and hopes to turn a tidy profit by exploiting the precious resource. The situation turns critical when Jane recognizes Clayton's true intentions, and the only one who can save her from both the villainous industrialist and the menacing Tablat is the noble Tarzan of the apes(n)</desc>

Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) have just finished gorging themselves on savory White Castle hamburgers when they return to their apartment and hatch a plan for Harold to win the heart of his crush, Maria (Paula Garcés). Maria is going to Amsterdam, and if Harold can catch up with her overseas perhaps he can strike up a real love connection. After a close call with airport personnel and a chance encounter with Kumar's ex-girlfriend Vanessa (Danneel Harris) -- who hadn't yet told Kumar that she's engaged to be married -- the pot-loving pals finally board their flight for Amsterdam. Unfortunately for Harold, Kumar isn't able to endure the lengthy flight without an innocent puff or two from his smokeless bong. When the plane hits some turbulence and the bong is mistaken for a bomb, the flight is diverted to Guantanamo Bay and our spliff-smoking heroes are detained by overzealous Deputy Chief of Homeland Security Ron Fox (Rob Corddry). Now, if they can just escape from the world's most notorious prison compound, perhaps this hapless duo can succeed in convincing the authorities that they aren't enemy combatants, and that Kumar made the mistake of his life by letting Vanessa go. But before they can prove their innocence and get the girls, Harold and Kumar will have to outsmart the dreaded Ku Klux Klan, contend with a particularly precocious Cyclops baby, and successfully elude everyone's favorite debauched former child star -- Neil Patrick Harris(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">I Am Legend</title>
    <desc lang="en">Adapted from acclaimed author Richard Matheson's influential novelette of the same name, Constantine director Francis Lawrence's I Am Legend follows the last man on Earth as he struggles to survive while fending off the infected survivors of a devastating vampiric plague. A brilliant scientist who raced to discover a cure for the man-made virus as humanity came crumbling down all around him, Robert Neville (Will Smith) was inexplicably immune to the highly contagious superbug. Now the entire population of New York City -- and perhaps the world -- has been transformed into carnivorous bloodsuckers that fear the light and live solely to spread their contagion to any remaining living creature that crosses their path. It's been three years since civilization came to an end, and the loneliness has taken a devastating toll on Neville. By day he scours the city for food and supplies while sending out desperate radio messages in hopes that someone might respond, and by night he attempts to find a way to reverse the effects of the virus by experimenting with his own blood. But time is running out for Neville as the legions of infected watch his every move from the safety of the shadows, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. They, too, long to learn the secret that lurks in Neville's blood, though they will have to take caution while attempting to procure it because Neville will sooner die attempting to slay every last one of them than willingly giving up a single drop. Previously adapted for the screen in the 1964 Vincent Price frightener The Last Man on Earth and the 1971 Charlton Heston action film The Omega Man, Matheson's novelette also served as the inspiration for George A. Romero's groundbreaking zombie classic Night of the Living Dead(n)</desc>

Jeremy Clarkson and James May join forces to create a public information film to promote safer cycling, with their efforts presented to a panel of experts including members of Westminster Council and Olympic gold medal-winning rider Chris Boardman. Meanwhile, Jeremy - who has promised to change his name to Jennifer if the Porsche is faster around the test track than the McLaren P1 driven earlier in the series - compares the seventh-generation Volkswagen Golf GTI to BMW's critically acclaimed M135i. Breaking Bad star Aaron Paul fires up the Reasonably Priced Car to see what lap time he can achieve.(n)</desc>

Jeremy Clarkson and James May join forces to create a public information film to promote safer cycling, with their efforts presented to a panel of experts including members of Westminster Council and Olympic gold medal-winning rider Chris Boardman.

    <desc lang="en">Meet the big birds, a feathered family who've never flown a day in their lives. From ostriches to kiwis, these bizarre birds appear to be nature's greatest novelty act. How they came to be and how they continue to survive is a fascinating tale that has long captivated David Attenborough. In this programme, he tells a story of dedicated dads, enormous eggs and a serious need for speed. And far from being the court jesters of the animal world, these flightless curiosities once nearly ruled the planet.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah</title>
    <desc lang="en">The intricately plotted 18th Godzilla film involves time-travel to a remote island in 1944, Terminator 2-type cyborgs, and cute bat-mites called Dorats merging to form Ghidorah, who is killed by Godzilla in 1992 and resurrected as a half-metal flying machine to put down the big lizard. There's a lisping American commander aided by a "Major Spielberg," references to Tetsuo and Peter Arnett, and time-traveling villains out to keep Japan from becoming the world's most powerful economic force. The cluttered plot doesn't hurt the film much, as nearly everything else in this episode is a throwback to the Godzilla films of 30 years ago. There are still colossal battles between men in ratty monster suits and mysterious secret agents plotting to take over the world. The effects quality hasn't improved in the slightest, the theme music is the same, and the man playing Ghidorah appears to be wearing the original suit from 1964. These are, of course, positives for those who love the old films more than the big-budget remake. The fight scenes are fun, the M-11 cyborg is laughably silly, and the metal Ghidorah is impressive. Overall, this is a hokey but entertaining addition to the series, which continued with Gojira Tai Supeisugojira (1994)(n)</desc>

Six years after NASA beamed a powerful signal to an Earth-like planet outside our solar system, we get a response. Only the extraterrestrials don't send a message: they come calling, landing five huge amphibious spacecraft in the Pacific, just as a US/Japanese naval exercise has begun. The visitors initially just seem wary, but a panicked reaction from our warships makes them reassess us as hostile and sparks a ferocious response. And so it falls to hot-headed US Navy officer Lieutenant Alex Hopper, his older brother Commander Stone Hopper and the commander of the fleet Admiral Shane to defeat a threat which is greater than they first think. Also starring singer Rihanna as a US Navy gunner, though perhaps the film's real star is its CGI special effects. Edited for language and violence(n)</desc>

As the countdown to the Purge starts ticking, struggling waitress Eva (Carmen Ejogo) risks her safety by staying late at work to ask her boss for a raise. Later, as she returns home to her elderly father (John Beasley) and daughter Cali (Zoë Soul), bickering couple Shane (Zach Gilford) and Liz (Kiele Sanchez) attempt to make their way out of the city following a frightening run-in with a gang of masked, machete-wielding thugs. While these five people are eager to seek sanctuary from the impending wave of violence about to flood the streets, a lone stranger (Frank Grillo) intent on seeking vengeance for the wrongful death of his son plans to draw blood from the man responsible. Armed to the teeth as he cruises the city in a modified muscle car, he gets sidetracked from his mission when he sees Eva and Cali fighting for their lives against a small army of black-clad soldiers. Against his better judgment, he rescues the pair, only realizing later that Shane and Liz also jumped into his backseat in order to escape a gang that disabled their car and were hunting them through the streets. When the stranger's car is similarly damaged beyond the point of repair, this unlikely group must stick together in order to survive the night.

    <title lang="en">2 Guns</title>
    <desc lang="en">Contraband director Baltasar Kormákur and star Mark Wahlberg reteam for this all-star thriller centered on the fragile alliance between two operatives from rival bureaus, neither of whom realize that the other is working undercover. For the past year, U.S. naval intelligence officer Marcus Stigman (Wahlberg) and DEA agent Bobby Trench (Denzel Washington) have been on a covert mission to infiltrate a powerful narcotics syndicate. In the criminal underworld, trust comes in short supply. Stigman and Trench have been forced to work as partners, but continue to eye one another with an air of suspicion. Both men realize their only hope for survival is to stick together, however, after a sensitive mission involving a Mexican drug cartel goes horribly awry. Their identities compromised as their respective agencies deny any knowledge of their existence, Stigman and Trench must now elude capture by the authorities while using their acute criminal know-how to also strike back at the ruthless gangsters who would sooner see them six-feet underground, rather than rotting away behind bars. Bill Paxton, Edward James Olmos, Paula Patton, and James Marsden co-star(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Slumdog Millionaire</title>
    <desc lang="en">(2008) Danny Boyle's eight Oscar- and seven BAFTA-winning blockbuster opens as Jamal Malik (Dev Patel), a chaiwalah at a call centre, is on the verge of winning 20 million rupees on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? . But the host of the show, Prem Kumar (Anil Kapoor) is convinced he's cheating and hands him over to the police to beat the truth out of him. Jamal reveals that the right answer to each question has come from a significant part of his life, from when he and his brother Salim were orphaned after their mother was killed in religious violence. As he continues his story, Jamal reveals how he knows each answer; how he fell in love with Latika, an orphaned girl from whom he was later separated; and how his brother Salim took the path of violence as a gangster's gunman. But as Jamal is returned to the studio for the last question, Salim finally repays his brother's trust. As well as the outstanding Patel, Jamal is played in different stages of his life by Tanay Hemant Gharu and Ayush Mahesh Khedekar; Salim is played by Madhur Mittal, Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala and Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail; Latika is played by Frieda Pinto, Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar and Rubina Ali, all of whom turn in stunning performances.

    <title lang="en">Slumdog Millionaire</title>
    <desc lang="en">(2008) Danny Boyle's eight Oscar- and seven BAFTA-winning blockbuster opens as Jamal Malik (Dev Patel), a chaiwalah at a call centre, is on the verge of winning 20 million rupees on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? . But the host of the show, Prem Kumar (Anil Kapoor) is convinced he's cheating and hands him over to the police to beat the truth out of him. Jamal reveals that the right answer to each question has come from a significant part of his life, from when he and his brother Salim were orphaned after their mother was killed in religious violence. As he continues his story, Jamal reveals how he knows each answer; how he fell in love with Latika, an orphaned girl from whom he was later separated; and how his brother Salim took the path of violence as a gangster's gunman. But as Jamal is returned to the studio for the last question, Salim finally repays his brother's trust. As well as the outstanding Patel, Jamal is played in different stages of his life by Tanay Hemant Gharu and Ayush Mahesh Khedekar; Salim is played by Madhur Mittal, Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala and Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail; Latika is played by Frieda Pinto, Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar and Rubina Ali, all of whom turn in stunning performances.

Kate Holbrook (Fey) is a 37-year-old business executive who has always put her professional life before her personal life, but these days her biological clock is ticking louder than ever before. As with everything else she has accomplished in life, Kate is determined to have a child on her own terms. Unfortunately for Kate, the chance of her ever becoming pregnant is slim to none. Undaunted, a willful Kate drafts South Philly working-class girl Angie Ostrowiski (Poehler) -- a woman who may just be her polar opposite -- to be a surrogate mother. Subsequently informed by the head of the surrogacy center (Sigourney Weaver) that her surrogate is indeed pregnant, the excited mother-to-be soon purchases every child-rearing book she can find and excitedly begins the nesting process. But life hasn't quit throwing Kate curveballs just yet, because when a pregnant Angie shows up on her doorstep with no place to live, the woman who once thrived on order finds her life descending into chaos. Now, as Kate attempts to transform Angie into the ideal expectant mother, this odd couple will discover that families aren't always biological, but occasionally formed through friendship as well.

Meanwhile, Toula struggles to spice up her marriage to Ian (John Corbett), and is heartbroken when her daughter Paris (Elena Kampouris) says she wants to go to a distant college in order to get away from her overbearing clan(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">A Serious Man</title>
    <desc lang="en">Filmmaking duo Joel and Ethan Coen write, produce, and direct this period black comedy set in 1967 concerning a Midwestern physics professor whose staid and stable life slowly begins to unravel after his wife announces that she's leaving him. As if the failure of his longtime marriage wasn't enough for Larry Gopnik (Tony-nominated Michael Stuhlbarg) to contend with, now his socially inept brother refuses to move out of the house as well. Larry is a modest man of science. Up to this point, his life has been uneventful at best, but things are about to get interesting. When his wife, Judith, announces that she is leaving him to move in with his smug colleague Sy Ableman, Larry does his best to contend with his failed marriage while barely tolerating his unemployable brother, Arthur, who appears to have grown roots on Larry's couch. Meanwhile, Larry's son, Danny, is getting into trouble at Hebrew school, and his daughter, Sarah, is stealthily snatching money from his wallet so she can afford a nose job. As Judith and Sy merrily begin making plans for their new life of domestic bliss together, Larry begins receiving a series of anonymous letters from someone who seems intent on sabotaging his chance for tenure at the university. To further complicate matters, a graduate student with failing grades is attempting to bribe the professor while simultaneously threatening him with a defamation lawsuit. Larry is in some serious need of equilibrium, though it's hard to focus on getting your life in order when your beautiful neighbor insists on sunbathing in the nude just outside your window. Perhaps by seeking the advice of three trusted rabbis, Larry can finally learn to cope with his afflictions and become a genuine mensch. A Serious Man is the second in a two-picture deal that the siblings made with Focus Features and Working Title. The first film in the deal, entitled Burn After Reading and starring Brad Pitt, George Clooney, and Frances McDormand, was released nationwide in September 2008(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Number 23</title>
    <desc lang="en">Jim Carrey and Virginia Madsen star in this dark psychological thriller from director Joel Schumacher. Walter Sparrow is leading a contented life until his wife Agatha innocently gives him a battered old paperback as a gift. As he reads, Sparrow is astonished by the parallels between his life and that of the novel's protagonist, Fingerling. But as the plot progresses it grows darker, featuring themes of transgressive sex, suicide and murder. It also hinges around Fingerling's obsession with the number 23 - a prime number that seems to pop up everywhere in the universe once you start to notice it. It's not long before 23 takes a similar hold on Sparrow. And, when he begins unjustly to view Agatha in the same distrustful light that Fingerling views his own spouse Fabrizia, it seems as if Sparrow has locked on to the same tragic trajectory as the story's lead character. Or can he find a way to wrench himself from the novel's grip?(n)</desc>

While all three are successful in their careers -- Kate has been named headmistress of an upscale private school, Molly is a doctor, and Janine's a police detective -- they've been striking out in the dating scene, and they get together on a regular basis to compare notes and drown their sorrows in cocktails and chocolate. One day, while attending the funeral of a colleague, Kate makes the acquaintance of Jed (Kenny Doughty), a good-looking man who remembers Kate as one of his teachers when he attended the school years ago. Despite the decade-and-a-half gap in their ages, there's a strong mutual attraction between Kate and Jed, and before the day is over the two are enjoying an affair. Molly and Janine are at once amused and appalled at Kate for dating a younger man, and while she tells them it's a short-lived fling that means little to either party, neither Kate nor Jed wants to walk away from their relationship; before long Kate and Jed decide they've fallen in love and plan to get married. The harder Molly and Janine try to convince Kate that she's making a mistake, the more Kate is determined to tie the knot with Jed, and eventually Molly and Janine decide to take drastic measures -- Molly hatches a plan to seduce Jed, while Janine captures their tryst on videotape(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The audition stage of the nationwide talent contest reaches its penultimate round, as Ant and Dec invite another batch of auditionees to show off their unique abilities to judges Simon Cowell, David Walliams, Amanda Holden and Alesha Dixon. Next Monday will see the beginning of the live shows, in which the panel begins the process of whittling down the number of would-be stars they have previously thrown their weight behind throughout the audition process. The Golden Buzzer went unpressed on Saturday 6th May, which means David Walliams and Ant and Dec may still have the right to send an act straight through to the semi-final, but will any of this evening's performers catch their eye?.(n)</desc>

The Golden Buzzer went unpressed on Saturday 6th May, which means David Walliams and Ant and Dec may still have the right to send an act straight through to the semi-final, but will any of this evening's performers catch their eye?.(n)</desc>

She's given birth to a stillborn baby in the past, so the keepers have a close eye on her. Cameras also follow Red panda Jung, who has been getting the cold shoulder from his partner Nima since they had two cubs.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In the second of two programmes about relationships in the wild, Liz Bonnin explores the ways in which animals get together. She observes a form of extreme flirting in a troop of capuchin monkeys in South America, which sees the females go to extraordinary lengths to attract the alpha male, reveals how African hyenas find it tough getting a girl and how an orang-utan in America chooses its partner in a very 21st-century way. For other animals, it turns out smell is a deal-breaker, while for others, it's all about having the best moves on the dance floor.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The American</title>
    <desc lang="en">In the aftermath of a job gone awry, an American hitman retreats to the Italian countryside, where he befriends a local priest and strikes up an unexpected romance while awaiting the details of his next assignment. Jack (George Clooney) is lucky to be alive after his Swedish assignment went sour, and he knows that it's only a matter of time before his luck runs out. Not eager to tempt fate again, Jack arrives in a small Italian town and takes a job assembling a weapon for the mysterious Mathilde (Thekla Reuten). During this uncharacteristically peaceful interlude, Jack befriends kindly clergyman Father Benedetto (Paolo Bonacelli), and connects with pretty local Clara (Violante Placido). But in the process of reaching out for a little human contact, Jack is making himself more vulnerable than ever. The American was adapted for the screen from the novel A Very Private Gentleman by author Martin Booth(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Willow Creek</title>
    <desc lang="en">A young couple (Alexie Gilmore, Bryce Johnson) venture into Six Rivers National Forest in Northern California to search for Bigfoot, and make a terrifying discovery in this found-footage horror film from writer-director Bobcat Goldthwait. Convinced that he will capture video evidence of Sasquatch at the same place where the legendary Patterson-Gimlin film was shot, Jim (Bryce Johnson) persuades his skeptical girlfriend Kelly (Alexie Gilmore) to join him on a cryptozoological excursion into the deep woods. Before Jim and Kelly set out on their mission, however, they first visit Willow Creek -- a town that thrives on the Bigfoot phenomenon -- to interview the locals about the legend. There, the couple are repeatedly warned that the forest can be a dangerous place at night -- warnings that go unheeded by Jim as he single-mindedly focuses on making the journey he's dreamt about for years. Later, in the darkened woods, however, the once-carefree couple experience paralyzing fear when someone -- or something -- begins rooting around their campsite, and uttering inhuman howls. Uncertain if they've actually survived an encounter with Bigfoot or simply fallen victim to a cruel prank by the locals, Jim and Kelly agree to pack their bags, and return to civilization at sunrise. But this is just the beginning of a nightmare that neither of them may ever awaken from(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In the aftermath of a job gone awry, an American hitman retreats to the Italian countryside, where he befriends a local priest and strikes up an unexpected romance while awaiting the details of his next assignment. Jack (George Clooney) is lucky to be alive after his Swedish assignment went sour, and he knows that it's only a matter of time before his luck runs out. Not eager to tempt fate again, Jack arrives in a small Italian town and takes a job assembling a weapon for the mysterious Mathilde (Thekla Reuten). During this uncharacteristically peaceful interlude, Jack befriends kindly clergyman Father Benedetto (Paolo Bonacelli), and connects with pretty local Clara (Violante Placido). But in the process of reaching out for a little human contact, Jack is making himself more vulnerable than ever. The American was adapted for the screen from the novel A Very Private Gentleman by author Martin Booth(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Kill Your Darlings</title>
    <desc lang="en">Daniel Radcliffe stars as Beat Generation icon Allen Ginsberg in this biopic set during the famed poet's early years at Columbia University, and centering on a murder investigation involving Ginsberg, his handsome classmate Lucien Carr, and fellow Beat author William S. Burroughs. The year is 1944. Ginsberg (Radcliffe) is a young student at Columbia University when he falls hopelessly under the spell of charismatic classmate Carr (Dane DeHaan). Alongside Carr, Ginsberg manages to strike up friendships with aspiring writers William S.

Drifting into downtown Buffalo, Billy kidnaps teen Layla (Christina Ricci) and has her pose as his loving wife when he visits his parents (Ben Gazzara and Anjelica Huston). Layla praises him and goes along with his fanciful tale that they met at CIA headquarters, where they both worked. Mom and dad not only fall for this, they are entranced by Layla, who soon begins to embellish her act. When she claims to be pregnant by Billy, he hustles her out to a bowling alley and on to a restaurant, where they run into trampy Wendy (Rosanna Arquette), who might be Billy's former girlfriend. Eventually, Billy seems ready to track down and kill the person he feels was responsible for his five years in the slammer. Shown at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival(n)</desc>

The eager horticulturists sent have no idea that an indigenous population of bloodthirsty anacondas has been privy to the orchid's properties for years. Not only have the orchids augmented their already phenomenal size, strength, and vitality, they've substantially increased the snakes' appetites for flesh.

    <title lang="en">The Perfect Man</title>
    <desc lang="en">A girl plays Cupid for her mom, but has to invent the right man to woo her in this romantic comedy. Jean Hamilton (Heather Locklear) is a single mother with two daughters, teenaged Holly (Hilary Duff) and grade-school-aged Zoe (Aria Wallace). Fortysomething Jean has stumbled in and out of a number of bad relationships in her lifetime, and is desperate to find a good man; however, Holly has grown a bit tired of Jean's favored means of therapy after a bad breakup -- packing up the family and moving to a new city. Once Jean and her girls settle in Brooklyn, Holly thinks they should stay for a while, and when Jean's romantic prospects begin to look less than rosy, Holly and her new friend Amy (Vanessa Lengies) decide to invent a secret admirer for her. Needing advice on what the "perfect man" would say and do, Holly and Amy turn to Ben (Chris Noth), Amy's uncle, who talks a very good game when it comes to romance. But convincing Jean that there's a real man behind the steady stream of letters and e-mails from her new admirer isn't as easy as Holly imagines, and it looks as if her imaginary suitor might get in the way of a flesh-and-blood Mr. Right(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Django Unchained</title>
    <desc lang="en">A former slave and a German bounty hunter become unlikely allies in the battle against a tyrannical plantation owner in this western from visionary director Quentin Tarantino. Two years before the Civil War pits brother-against-brother, German-born fugitive hunter Dr. King Schultz (Academy Award-winner Christoph Waltz) arrives in America determined to capture the outlaw Brittle brothers dead or alive. In the midst of his search, Dr. Schultz crosses paths with Django (Academy Award-winner Jamie Foxx), a freed slave and skilled tracker who seeks to rescue his beloved wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from ruthless plantation owner Calvin Candie (Academy Award-nominee Leonardo DiCaprio). Once Django has aided Dr. Schultz in coralling the Brittle brothers, the two team up to capture some of the most wanted men in the South. Meanwhile, Django never loses sight of his mission to free Broomhilda from the treacherous slave trade before it's too late. Upon arriving at Candie's nefarious plantation, dubbed Candyland, Django and Dr. Schultz discover that slaves are being groomed for gladiator-like competitions by Candie's malevolent right-hand man Billy Crash (Walton Goggins), and together they skillfully work their way onto the compound for a closer look. But just as Django and his partner locate Broomhilda and plot a daring escape, Candie's house slave Stephen (Academy Award-nominee Samuel L. Jackson) catches wind of their plan, and informs his master of the betrayal. Now, as a clandestine organization attempts to back them into a corner, Django and Dr. Schultz will have to come out with pistols blazing if they ever hope to free Broomhilda from Candyland and the clutches of its vile proprietor(n)</desc>
