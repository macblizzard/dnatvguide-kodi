    <title lang="en">Hollywood Ending</title>
    <desc lang="en">A down-on-his luck auteur gets one more chance at the big time -- provided his neuroses don't swallow him whole -- in Woody Allen's 33rd feature release, Hollywood Ending. Allen plays Val Waxman, a one-time cinematic genius who's resorted to taking advertisement work to pay the bills for himself and his airhead live-in girlfriend, Lori (Debra Messing). Val finds his luck is about to change, however, when he receives the script for The City Never Sleeps , a period noir set against the backdrop of 1940s New York City. It seems his ex-wife, Ellie (Tea Leoni), now an executive at Galaxy Pictures, has been pulling for him to direct the picture, claiming he's the only man who can do justice to the script. She even manages to convince her boyfriend, Hal (Treat Williams), Galaxy's high-powered studio head, to take a chance on Val's "unique vision." Just when the cameras are ready to roll, however, Val finds that unique vision in jeopardy -- literally -- as he's struck with a psychosomatic case of blindness. When physicians and psychiatrists fail to cure him, Val contrives a scheme to forge ahead with the picture, for fear of blowing his one last chance at greatness. Hollywood Ending co-stars George Hamilton and Mark Rydell(n)</desc>

Big Bird realises he's forgotten to tell Santa that he's staying at The Furchester Hotel for Christmas and is worried that Santa won't know where to deliver his presents. Elmo and the other guests haven't told Santa either and become really worried. Will Santa know where to deliver their presents? It's too late to get a letter to the North Pole, so the Furchesters try to distract all the guests with their Christmas activities. However, every mention of Santa makes everyone worried again, they don't finish any of the activities they started. And Phoebe is disappointed that she can't enjoy her Christmas the way the Furchesters planned it. With the help of Harvey P Dull, Elmo and Big Bird realise there's more to Christmas than presents, and that sharing traditions and celebrating together is what makes Christmas so special.(n)</desc>

Ricky's rage and sorrow grow as he discovers how dangerous conditions were for his ancestors, eerily echoing his own fight for workers' rights as a trade unionist in the 1970s.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Jeremy Paxman joins forces with `art sleuth' Bernadette Murphy in a bid to solve one of the greatest and bloodiest mysteries of the art world - why did Vincent Van Gogh take a blade to his own ear in December, 1888? The pair set out to discover why the Dutch post-impressionist chose to mutilate himself, and also to identify the unknown girl to whom he is reported to have given is severed ear. Their quest takes them from Vincent's former home in the south of France to the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, and along the way, they seek to determine the causes of the painter's debilitating mental turmoil. The answers they are looking for, however, might not lie in Europe. Instead, a library in California may hold crucial evidence that - if verified - could cause an art world sensation.(n)</desc>

Hear from the prosecutors who have made their capture a full-time job and the historians who will explain why the Genovese will never die(n)</desc>

Ever since, the cause of the tragedy has remained a mystery, with a static electric charge, a design flaw and an act of sabotage all blamed by experts. In this programme, a team including aeronautical engineer Jem Stansfield puts the leading theories to the test with the help of three scale models.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Ghost Town. After being invited to the opening of Steve's (David Eigenberg) new bar, Scout, both Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) and Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) are haunted by the Ghost of Boyfriends Past. Miranda finds herself unsettled because she had always encouraged Steve to open his own place, while Carrie is haunted by the news that Steve's silent partner in the venture is none other than Aidan (John Corbett), the hunky furniture maker she so callously cheated on with Big (Chris Noth). Realizing she still has very strong feelings for Aidan, Carrie discovers she can't stop thinking about him and the way she treated him, especially when she bumps into him at the bar's opening party. Charlotte (Kristin Davis) has ghosts of her own to contend with when she moves back into Trey's (Kyle MacLachlan) apartment, which bears the decorating imprint of Trey's mother, Bunny (Frances Sternhagen). When Charlotte decides to update the décor and get rid of the wooden duck decoys that festoon the place, she meets considerable resistance from the McDougal matriarch, who is finally exorcised after she catches Charlotte and Trey in the throes of conjugal bliss. And, for her part, Samantha (Kim Cattrall) is haunted by the boredom of her relationship with Maria (Sonia Braga), which revolves around long baths and even longer talks about "feelings."(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Documentary in which three people who were the lone survivors of aircraft crashes discuss their ordeals, detailing the conflicting emotions they experienced after realising everyone else on board had died. D-Day veteran Phil Bradley was trapped in his seat for 36 hours after the plane he was travelling on crashed in Virginia in 1959, while Annette Herfkens drank rainwater to stay alive after a Vietnam Airlines jet crashed into a mountain in 1992. Juliane Koepcke, meanwhile, tells of being lost for 10 days in the Peruvian rainforest after a plane crash in 1971, and how her knowledge of jungle terrain helped to save her life.(n)</desc>

Its size seems ill-suited to surviving the most arid regions of Africa, but its inner workings allow it to defy the extreme heat of the desert, and find food and water in seemingly barren landscapes, while its extraordinary memory enables it to repel predators. Here, Chris reveals how hairs on the skin help to keep the elephant cool, and how sensors in its feet may be able to guide it toward rain.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Ants.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Chris Packham explores the ingenious ways in which ants have collaborated to colonise the planet like no other animal. Natural air conditioning systems keep them cool in their nests, shelters made from their own bodies protect them from the elements, and a strong sense of smell helps them to overpower animals hundreds of times larger than themselves. Plus, a look at recent research that reveals how ant colonies are capable of immunising themselves against certain diseases.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Chris Packham learns how foxes have been able to adapt and thrive in a world with an ever-increasing human population. New research reveals how the animals' split pupils enable them to hunt in the bright desert day, and the presenter discusses a theory that the creatures use the Earth's magnetic field to determine the location of their prey.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Elephants.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Chris Packham explores the anatomy and physiology of the largest land animal on the planet, the elephant. Its size seems ill-suited to surviving the most arid regions of Africa, but its inner workings allow it to defy the extreme heat of the desert, and find food and water in seemingly barren landscapes, while its extraordinary memory enables it to repel predators. Here, Chris reveals how hairs on the skin help to keep the elephant cool, and how sensors in its feet may be able to guide it toward rain.(n)</desc>

Famuyiwa's debut movie, following three black middle class teenagers, has a certain charm and the three leads are ably supported by a cast including Malinda Williams as the cutest girl in school and Tamal Jones as the ex-girlfriend Diggs seeks refuge with in the Wood rather than the Hood(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Wayne's World</title>
    <desc lang="en">Based on the Saturday Night Live sketch of the same name, Wayne's World is a wacky, irreverent pop-culture comedy about the adventures of two amiably aimless metal-head friends, Wayne (Mike Myers) and Garth (Dana Carvey). From Wayne's basement, the pair broadcast a talk-show called "Wayne's World" on local public access television. The show comes to the attention of a sleazy network executive (Rob Lowe) who wants to produce a big-budget version of "Wayne's World"--and he also wants Wayne's girlfriend, a rock singer named Cassandra (Tia Carrere). Wayne and Garth have to battle the executive not only to save their show, but also Cassandra. Director Penelope Spheeris, Myers and Carvey hang a lot of silly, but funny, jokes on this thin plot, and the energy of the cast--as well as the wild pop-culture references--make Wayne's World a cut above the average Saturday Night Live spin-off movie(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Intelligent thriller about an idealistic young doctor (Hugh Grant) who uncovers a sinister world of illegal medical experiments. Dr Guy Luthan (Grant) is working through another hard shift in the emergency room when he treats a delusional, homeless patient who exhibits wildly erratic and unfamiliar symptoms. To add to the mystery, the man is naked, except for a medical bracelet on his wrist that can only have come from another hospital. Luthan is unable to save the patient, but neither can he forget the unusual circumstances surrounding the man's arrival. He resolves to look into the case further, but when he looks for the autopsy report he finds that it is missing - and so is the body. Unwilling to let the matter drop, despite strong urging from his superiors at the hospital, Luthan continues to search for answers. As this search progresses, he experiences more bad 'luck': his apartment is broken into and he is loses his job. Clearly somebody wants him to stop his investigation. Undeterred, Luthan pursues the truth, and the trail leads to internationally renowned neurologist Dr. Lawrence Myrick (Gene Hackman), acclaimed for his research into regenerating spinal tissue. Myrick's research has the potential to change the world for countless victims of spinal injury - but does this excuse the terrible price being paid by innocent victims?(n)</desc>

Willis Newton (Matthew McConaughey) convinces his three brothers (Skeet Ulrich, Ethan Hawke, Vincent D'Onofrio) that bank robbing is not a major crime since banks are insured. Covering the years 1919 to 1924, the film details their robberies, along with Willis' affair with widowed mother Louise (Julianna Margulies). But their record of successes goes out of control in 1924 with a $3 million Chicago mail-train robbery, the greatest train heist in American history. The film displays documentary elements, including a 1980 Johnny Carson interview with the real-life Willis Newton(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">At the absolute height of World War II, German generals hatch a daring plan to assassinate Adolf Hitler and effectively render the German war machine impotent. Directed by Bryan Singer, Valkyrie stars Tom Cruise as Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, the real-life mastermind behind the elaborate plot known as Project Valkyrie: a plan to assassinate Hitler and overthrow his government from the inside. Stauffenberg has been a loyal soldier and an asset to the Reich for his entire military career, but after losing an eye, a hand, and three fingers in an Allied bombing, he reaches a breaking point. The destructive madness that his country is unleashing on the world has become too terrible for the colonel to stand silent. He joins the resistance movement -- a treasonous act, punishable by death -- and risks his life and the life of his family for the chance to change history. Comprised of high-ranking officials working in secret, the German Resistance has access to the inner workings of the government and military, putting them in the perfect position to dispatch the dictator and then use his own official contingency plan to seize power -- before the army, the S.S., and loyal party members can put someone just as diabolical in the Führer's place(n)</desc>

For the past year, U.S. naval intelligence officer Marcus Stigman (Wahlberg) and DEA agent Bobby Trench (Denzel Washington) have been on a covert mission to infiltrate a powerful narcotics syndicate. In the criminal underworld, trust comes in short supply. Stigman and Trench have been forced to work as partners, but continue to eye one another with an air of suspicion. Both men realize their only hope for survival is to stick together, however, after a sensitive mission involving a Mexican drug cartel goes horribly awry. Their identities compromised as their respective agencies deny any knowledge of their existence, Stigman and Trench must now elude capture by the authorities while using their acute criminal know-how to also strike back at the ruthless gangsters who would sooner see them six-feet underground, rather than rotting away behind bars. Bill Paxton, Edward James Olmos, Paula Patton, and James Marsden co-star(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Green Lantern</title>
    <desc lang="en">A test pilot embraces his destiny as a cosmic superhero in Casino Royale director Martin Campbell's adaptation of the popular DC Comics series. Ever since he saw his fearless father perish in a tragic aviation mishap, all Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds) could think about was flying -- it was the only thing the brash, cocky, and irresponsible test pilot ever truly excelled at. Little did he realize he was destined for something much bigger. Somewhere out in space, a powerful force of evil known as Parallax is spreading fear and destruction; the only hope for defeating Parallax is the Green Lantern Corps, a group of intergalactic warriors powered by the force of will. When legendary Green Lantern Abin Sur (Temuera Morrison) is sent hurtling toward planet Earth after a deadly encounter with Parallax, his ring chooses Hal to continue the fight. The ring spirits our hero away to the Green Lantern's home planet of Oa for training. The first human ever to receive the honor of becoming a Green Lantern, Hal is viewed with scorn by the league's leader, Sinestro (Mark Strong), who trains him alongside the hulking Kilowog (voice of Michael Clarke Duncan). Later, on planet Earth, frail scientist Hector Hammond (Peter Sarsgaard) becomes infected with Parallax's evil while performing an autopsy on Abin Sur, and uses his newfound powers to stake claim on Carol Ferris (Blake Lively), Hal's lifelong friend and fellow test pilot. When Hal learns that Parallax plans to consume all life on Earth to gain the energy needed to conquer Oa, he begins looking inward for the courage to defeat the malevolent force and embrace his destiny as a super-powered peacekeeper(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Green Lantern</title>
    <desc lang="en">A test pilot embraces his destiny as a cosmic superhero in Casino Royale director Martin Campbell's adaptation of the popular DC Comics series. Ever since he saw his fearless father perish in a tragic aviation mishap, all Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds) could think about was flying -- it was the only thing the brash, cocky, and irresponsible test pilot ever truly excelled at. Little did he realize he was destined for something much bigger. Somewhere out in space, a powerful force of evil known as Parallax is spreading fear and destruction; the only hope for defeating Parallax is the Green Lantern Corps, a group of intergalactic warriors powered by the force of will. When legendary Green Lantern Abin Sur (Temuera Morrison) is sent hurtling toward planet Earth after a deadly encounter with Parallax, his ring chooses Hal to continue the fight. The ring spirits our hero away to the Green Lantern's home planet of Oa for training. The first human ever to receive the honor of becoming a Green Lantern, Hal is viewed with scorn by the league's leader, Sinestro (Mark Strong), who trains him alongside the hulking Kilowog (voice of Michael Clarke Duncan). Later, on planet Earth, frail scientist Hector Hammond (Peter Sarsgaard) becomes infected with Parallax's evil while performing an autopsy on Abin Sur, and uses his newfound powers to stake claim on Carol Ferris (Blake Lively), Hal's lifelong friend and fellow test pilot. When Hal learns that Parallax plans to consume all life on Earth to gain the energy needed to conquer Oa, he begins looking inward for the courage to defeat the malevolent force and embrace his destiny as a super-powered peacekeeper(n)</desc>

On a train to Venice, the beautiful Elise Clifton-Ward sits next to him, and a romance seems to bud. Elise invites Frank to stay with her at a hotel, and then to attend a ball in the evening. But there's more to this seemingly flawless woman than meets the eye: hers is a complex world of vicious gangsters, fraud and millions of stolen dollars. And Elise has placed Frank at the centre of it merely as a decoy, hoping to convince her pursuers that he is her real lover, with his appearance altered by plastic surgery, so that she and her embezzler boyfriend can make good their escape. It seems to work: when Elise abandons him at the ball, Frank is chased by gangster Reginald Shaw (Steven Berkoff) and his men. But soon Frank and Elise are thrown back together, tangled in a mess of boat chases and gunshots, as they attempt to avoid both the police and the gangsters.

The only hotelier in Las Vegas who can claim that each and every one of his establishments has earned the Royal Review Board's Five Diamond Award, Willy Bank (Pacino) has made more than his share of enemies during his impressive ascent. While most of Bank's adversaries amount to little more than the occasional nuisance, however, this powerful player is about to find out that picking your enemies in Las Vegas can be a true gamble. In betraying Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould), Bank has finally crossed the one man who could bring his entire empire crumbling to the ground -- Danny Ocean (Clooney). Now Reuben is in critical condition, and Ocean is determined to strike back at the man who nearly murdered his mentor. Bank may have taken down one of the original Ocean's Eleven, but his efforts only managed to unite the remaining ten closer than ever before. As the opening of Bank's newest casino draws near, Danny and the crew set into motion a bold plan to humiliate the cocksure casino owner and forever tarnish his spotless reputation. It won't be easy, but if Ocean and his team can get their elaborate plan together in time for the opening of The Bank, they just might be able to deliver some serious Las Vegas justice(n)</desc>

The only hotelier in Las Vegas who can claim that each and every one of his establishments has earned the Royal Review Board's Five Diamond Award, Willy Bank (Pacino) has made more than his share of enemies during his impressive ascent. While most of Bank's adversaries amount to little more than the occasional nuisance, however, this powerful player is about to find out that picking your enemies in Las Vegas can be a true gamble. In betraying Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould), Bank has finally crossed the one man who could bring his entire empire crumbling to the ground -- Danny Ocean (Clooney). Now Reuben is in critical condition, and Ocean is determined to strike back at the man who nearly murdered his mentor. Bank may have taken down one of the original Ocean's Eleven, but his efforts only managed to unite the remaining ten closer than ever before. As the opening of Bank's newest casino draws near, Danny and the crew set into motion a bold plan to humiliate the cocksure casino owner and forever tarnish his spotless reputation. It won't be easy, but if Ocean and his team can get their elaborate plan together in time for the opening of The Bank, they just might be able to deliver some serious Las Vegas justice(n)</desc>

Ten-year-old Maya (Abigail Breslin) is heartbroken to see her parents splitting up, but she's determined to find out precisely how it was that mom and dad came together in the first place. When Maya starts questioning her father Will (Ryan Reynolds) about his life before marriage, dad's memories soon drift back to the time when, as a naïve Wisconsin native and aspiring politician hoping to work on the presidential election, he first arrived in New York City. As Will gradually became savvy to the ways of the big city, he gradually developed romantic relationships with three very different women: Emily (Elizabeth Banks) was the girl-next-door that he could always depend on, apolitical April (Isla Fisher) was the best friend and confidante who was always there to listen, and free-spirited journalist Summer (Rachel Weisz) was both beautiful and ambitious. In order to prevent his perceptive little girl from predicting the outcome before his story is told, Will carefully changes the names of his three romantic interests, creating a hopelessly romantic puzzle that highlights both the joys and hardships of true love(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Actress and writer Nia Vardalos, who became an overnight sensation with My Big Fat Greek Wedding, returns to the big screen with this gender-bending comedy. Connie (Vardalos) and Carla (Toni Collette) are best friends who've shared the same dream ever since they were teenagers -- making a name for themselves in the musical theater. However, after years of treading water on Chicago's dinner theater circuit and playing bottom-of-the-barrel nightclubs, the two are facing middle age with minimal career success. One evening after a performance, Connie and Carla have the misfortune of witnessing the murder of nightclub owner Frank (Michael Roberds) by low-level Mafiosi; the gals are seen by the shooters, and they hit the road in fear for their lives. Connie and Carla end up in Los Angeles, where they struggle to create new identities for themselves. After witnessing a drag review at a nightclub, they realize that even they have more talent than most of the men performing that evening, and they decide to pose as female impersonators in hopes of landing a gig. Connie and Carla's new act is an immediate hit, and soon they're the toast of L.A.'s gay community. But the women discover it's difficult to keep on fooling people into believing they're men, and things become even more complicated when the Mobsters discover that Connie and Carla are in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, Connie finds herself falling for Jeff (David Duchovny), a regular guy looking for his cross-dressing brother who can't understand why he's developing a crush on a drag queen(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Rushmore</title>
    <desc lang="en">After the highly acclaimed independent film Bottle Rocket, director Wes Anderson followed up with a quirky Touchstone Studios film entitled Rushmore. Written by Anderson and friend Owen Wilson (an actor in Armageddon and Anaconda), they created the story of Max Fischer, a highly eccentric 15-year-old boy who attends the tenth grade at Rushmore Academy. Played by Jason Schwartzman (Talia Shire's son and Francis Ford Coppola's nephew), Max is a poor student with big dreams and a love of extracurricular activities. Max is editor of the school newspaper and yearbook, president of the chess, astronomy, French, and German clubs, captain of the fencing team, and director of the school play. Max is also a compulsive liar, telling everyone that his barber father (Seymour Cassel) is really a brain surgeon. Suddenly Max falls in love with Miss Cross (Olivia Williams), a first-grade teacher at the school. He also makes a new friend in business tycoon Mr. Blume (Bill Murray), an eccentric millionaire who also loves Miss Cross. The love triangle heats up as Max refuses to believe that his age has anything to do with Miss Cross refusing his romantic advances. Also Max's scheme to erect an aquarium on the school baseball diamond gets him booted out of Rushmore Academy. As his life crumbles around him, he is forced to grow up and accept the consequences of his actions and his lies. He throws himself more into his extracurricular activities, hoping to redeem himself by staging the most ambitious school play ever attempted(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Tina Fey and Steve Carell star in Shawn Levy's chase comedy. Phil and Claire Foster feel their marriage has gone a bit stale and decide to pep it up by going out on a date, just like they used to do, before the kids and the mortgage and rest of life's inevitable distractions got in the way. In principal it's a good idea, but their first mistake is to try to get into one of Manhattan's swankiest restaurants without a reservation. Their second is far more serious: they bluff their way in, pretending to be a couple who have failed to show up for their table. Unfortunately for the Fosters, the absent diners have serious gangland connections. Even more unfortunately, the people whose identities they've adopted are due to be silenced forever by hitmen. Cue a tightly plotted, gag-packed, headlong flight for survival, which has distinct echoes of 40s screwball classics. And keep an eye out for memorable cameos from Mark Wahlberg and James Franco(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Will Gluck's intelligent and hilarious high school comedy stars Emma Stone in an outstanding lead performance. Olive Penderghast is something of an 'also ran' in her year at school, so when she spies the opportunity to make herself look a little more interesting and mature she jumps at it and tells a friend that she's lost her virginity to a college boy. However, what was supposed to be a confidential white lie becomes public, and soon she has the cachet of unprecedented notoriety around the entire school. But it's what happens next that's really interesting. Enjoying the glare of attention (despite the brickbats some of her more prudish classmates hurl), she not only sets out to build on her newfound rep as a scarlet woman, she also subverts the moment to help some of the school's more picked-upon students. The film references a host of teen movies, as well as American novelist Nathaniel Hawthorne's 1850 work The Scarlet Letter, but ultimately it's the quality of Stone's acting, allied to a very funny script, that makes this such an enjoyable watch(n)</desc>

A likeable young man despite his depressive disposition, Zia (Patrick Fugit) puts blade to wrist only to find that the pain of life doesn't end with the coming of death. Now trapped in a bleak metaphysical landscape populated entirely by suicide victims blearily searching for the joys that eluded them in the physical realm, Zia soon learns that the love is one of the latest arrivals in the dreary land of the dead. As Zia sets out to locate his ill-fated former companion and experience the joys that eluded the couple in life, he is joined in his quest by a lovelorn Russian rocker named Eugene (Shea Wigham) and an accidental tourist named Mikal (Shannyn Sossamon), who's looking for a way out of the sorrowful stir(n)</desc>

Carrie suggests that someone on their side may have given it to Hamid and pushes for everyone who came into contact with him to submit to a polygraph test. Carrie is certain it was Brody who gave Hamid the razor, and when the director gives her the go-ahead for the polygraphs, she's convinced she'll soon have proof. Carrie and Saul continue to track Faisel, who they believe has skipped town after being tipped off by someone. They are taken aback when they discover that he appears to have an accomplice: a woman who is possibly American. Brody prepares to deliver the eulogy at Tom Walker's funeral, but struggles with his guilt about what he did to Tom while they were prisoners in Afghanistan.

Paul Giamatti is an anxious New Yorker who finds the answer to his deep-rooted malaise after stumbling upon an article about a high-tech company that claims to have found a solution to human suffering. By deep-freezing souls, claims the company, they can give their customers a life free from fear, doubt, and worry. Eager to free himself from the emotional burden of angst, Giamatti eagerly enlists their services. Trouble arises, however, when Giamatti's soul is swiped by a soul-trafficking "mule" who in turn gives it to a no-talent Russian soap opera actress. Now, in order to get back the soul that is rightfully his, Giamatti must make the arduous trip to St. Petersburg, along the way discovering that the true key to happiness isn't the absence of pain, but the ability to experience the entire spectrum of emotion and cherish the things that really matter(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Nick Hornby's acclaimed memoir about one man's struggle to balance his love of a woman and his love for soccer was the basis of a well-reviewed British film in 1997, and now gets a Americanized rewrite with this picture, in which the game is changed from soccer to baseball. Ben (Jimmy Fallon) is a high-school teacher who meets Lindsay (Drew Barrymore), who has a successful career in business. Ben and Lindsay don't appear to have much in common on the surface, but they hit it off and are soon involved in a serious romance. But when spring rolls around, Lindsay becomes aware of the true love of Ben's life -- the Boston Red Sox. Despite the team's lamentable record, Ben has been a fiercely loyal Red Sox fan since childhood, and Lindsay finds it hard to compete with his passion for baseball, while Ben is forced to choose between the obsessions of his youth and the enthusiasms of a responsible adult. Fever Pitch was shot in part in Boston during the 2004 baseball season, which to the surprise of the filmmakers saw the Red Sox winning baseball's world series for the first time since 1918(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">New York City, 1863. Before there was the city we know today, a city of wealth, power and infinite dreams, New York was a very different place, a fledgling young city where the desire for a better life raged in crime-ridden streets. Here, as the Nations own survival was being tested by the ongoing Civil War, a vast and dangerous underworld was born in the streets. These were the gangs of New York, as portrayed in Herbert Asburys classic book, whose racketeering, bootlegging, swindling, gambling and murdering would become legendary - and whose culture of corruption threatened the very survival of Americas working people. In the young, unfinished City, it was a time of ruthlessness, intolerance and fear. But it was also a time of extraordinary bravery, as those pushed to the edge fought for the freedom of future generations. Director Martin Scorsese sets this epic drama in this defining moment in New York City history, an era whose conflicts helped define who and what makes an American. Against the backdrop of this brave new world unfolds a story about a fatherless sons search for honor, vengeance and the courage to remake his life(n)</desc>

Ben (Jimmy Fallon) is a high-school teacher who meets Lindsay (Drew Barrymore), who has a successful career in business. Ben and Lindsay don't appear to have much in common on the surface, but they hit it off and are soon involved in a serious romance. But when spring rolls around, Lindsay becomes aware of the true love of Ben's life -- the Boston Red Sox. Despite the team's lamentable record, Ben has been a fiercely loyal Red Sox fan since childhood, and Lindsay finds it hard to compete with his passion for baseball, while Ben is forced to choose between the obsessions of his youth and the enthusiasms of a responsible adult. Fever Pitch was shot in part in Boston during the 2004 baseball season, which to the surprise of the filmmakers saw the Red Sox winning baseball's world series for the first time since 1918(n)</desc>

The friends quickly find themselves with only one option if they wish to remain on campus rent-free and nab the real culprits: the sorority known as Delta Omicron Gamma (D.O.G.), an institution widely known for its members' deficiency of physical beauty. After undergoing radical transformations thanks to wigs, makeup, and some serious depilatory efforts, the boys are soon passing themselves off as Daisy, Adena, and Roberta. It's not long before their past mistreatment of women has come back to haunt them, while Dave falls in love with Leah (Melissa Sagemiller), the head of the sorority, forcing him to consider when and where to confess the truth. In the meantime, the boys draw closer to learning the identity of the real thieves. Sorority Boys (2002) co-stars Heather Matarazzo(n)</desc>

Anthony "Swoff" Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) decides to join the Marines, just like his father and his father before him, and signs on just in time to be sent to Iraq to fight in the Gulf War in 1991. After experiencing the rigors of boot camp, Swofford and his pal Troy (Peter Sarsgaard) are trained to be snipers, and under the leadership of Sgt. Sykes (Jamie Foxx) and Lt. Col. Kazinski (Chris Cooper), the two land in the middle of a desert where they're up against an enemy they can't always see under a blazing sun with hours of boredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror. Swofford, Troy, and their fellow soldiers rely on the wits, their sense of humor, and their friendship of their brothers in arms to deal with a situation that doesn't much resemble what they saw on television at home. Jarhead was based on the memoirs of the real-life Anthony Swofford, who did serve as a sniper in the 1991 Gulf War; the title comes from military slang for a Marine enlistee(n)</desc>

Raised on the mean streets of Cleveland, Greene's tough reputation eventually lands him a contact with the local mob. Before long, the scrappy local has become a mafia enforcer, but after forming an alliance with notorious gangster John Nardi (Vincent D'Onofrio) and burning feared loan shark Shondor Birns (Christopher Walken), Greene starts to discover that he has the potential to become as powerful as any of his adversaries.

    <title lang="en">Where Do We Go Now?</title>
    <desc lang="en">Women try to persuade their men to put a stop to war in this fusion of comedy and drama from director, screenwriter, and actress Nadine Labaki. Amale (Labaki) runs a café in a small Lebanese village where the local women, both Christian and Muslim, get together to talk, swap ideas, and share grief as the number who've lost sons or husbands in frequent skirmishes continues to grow. The fighting between religious and political factions has been going on for years, and one day Amale and her friends Afaf (Layla Hakim), Saydeh (Antoinette Noufaily), Takla (Claude Baz Moussawbaa), and Yvonne (Yvonne Maalouf) decide it's time to stop talking about the fighting and do something to bring it to a halt. The local women join forces to distract their men, convinced if they put their minds on other things they won't worry so much about killing. Their efforts range from serving hashish-laced baked goods at a community get-together to hiring Ukrainian dancers to show off their charms to the menfolk. After a young man is killed in a gun battle, the women realize they need to take a stronger stand if they intend to make their home safe again; meanwhile, Christian Amale unwittingly strikes a blow for religious unity when she falls for handsome Muslim Rabih (Julien Farhat).

Mayer and Harry Cohn). Despising the film capital and everything it stands for, Barton Fink comes down with an acute case of writer's block. He is looked after by a secretary (Judy Davis) who has been acting as a ghost writer for an alcoholic screenwriter (John Mahoney, playing a character based on William Faulkner).

And then comes the plot twist to end all plot twists, plunging Barton Fink into a surreal nightmare that would make Hieronymus Bosch look like a house painter.

Second son Jason attempts to rule the family with an iron fist, but he's full of resentment towards Caddy's bastard child. All of them attempt to care for the developmentally disabled Benjy (Franco).

Once upon a time, Ben Kalmen (Douglas) had everything a man could possibly want -- a high-paying job, a beautiful wife, and a spacious Manhattan apartment -- but now all of that is a distant memory. The former owner of a successful auto dealership, Ben has recently lost everything thanks to his own inability to resist his impulses. But the resilient Ben isn't the type of guy to stay down for the count, and lately things are starting to look up for him again. Despite being divorced from his former college sweetheart Nancy (Susan Sarandon), Ben still manages to see his daughter, Susan (Jenna Fischer), and his grandson on a regular basis, and his new girlfriend, Jordan (Mary-Louise Parker), may have just the connections needed to help the floundering businessman get his career back on track. When Ben takes Jordan's college-bound daughter, Allyson (Imogen Poots), on a tour of a prospective school, however, his steely new resolve is put to the ultimate test(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Which Way Is Up?</title>
    <desc lang="en">This Americanized remake of Lina Wertmuller's The Seduction of Mimi offered audiences the novelty of seeing Richard Pryor performing three different roles in the same film. Which Way Is Up? tells the tale of Leroy Jones (Pryor), a poor orange picker who gets fired from his job when he accidentally joins a worker's union during a demonstration. He is forced to travel to Los Angeles and abandon his family, which includes his wife, Annie Mae (Margaret Avery), and his perpetually randy father, Rufus (also Pryor). While there, he falls in love with labor organizer Vanetta (Lonette McKee), but is soon rehired by his former employers when they realize he is easily manipulated. Back home, Leroy discovers his new managerial role alienates him from his former friends as he tries to divide his time between Annie Mae and Vanetta. When he discovers Annie Mae has been impregnated by the Reverend Lennox Thomas (Pryor's 3rd role) during his absence, Leroy sets his sights on seducing Lennox's wife. The resulting film had ambition to spare, but was generally panned as an inferior remake by the critics and failed to find a mass audience. However, Which Way Is Up? gained a second lease on life via cable and home video and has become a cult favorite with Pryor's fans(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Deep End of the Ocean</title>
    <desc lang="en">A drama that touches on the issues of the rights of adoptive vs. biological parents, and what is ultimately best for the child, The Deep End Of The Ocean stars Michelle Pfeiffer and Treat Williams as Beth and Pat Cappadora, working parents with three children. When Beth visits Chicago with the kids, she asks the oldest son to watch the youngest, three-year-old Ben, while she checks in to a hotel. When she returns a few minutes later, Ben has disappeared, nowhere to be found. Despite the best efforts of police detective Candy Bliss (Whoopi Goldberg), no trace of the boy can be discovered, and the loss has a profound effect on the family, especially Beth. Nine years later, a boy knocks on the Cappadoras' door, asking if they'd like him to mow their lawn. While Beth can hardly believe her first instinct, she soon discovers it's true -- the boy cutting the grass is actually Ben, who has been living with another family since his disappearance. While Ben is returned to the Cappadoras, the reunion isn't as blissful as everyone imagined at first; the family discovers Ben is in many ways a stranger to them, and Ben misses his adopted father, running away to be with him. Stephen Schiff based his screenplay on the 1996 novel by Jacquelyn Mitchard(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Long Live Walter Jameson. College professor Kittridge (Edgar Stehli) cannot understand why the history lectures of his future son-in-law, Professor Walter Jameson (Kevin McCarthy), seem so vividly real -- as if Jameson were actually present at the incidents he describes. It turns out that Jameson is actually several hundred (if not several thousand ) years old, and that he has been blessed -- or cursed -- with the gift of immortality. Only the intervention of a "ghost" from Jameson's past can prevent him from ruining the life of Kittridge's daughter Suzanna (Dody Heath). Boasting a powerful script by Charles Beaumont, not to mention the makeup prowess of William Tuttle, "Long Live Walter Jameson" made its first TV appearance on March 18, 1960(n)</desc>
