    <sub-title lang="en">Classic Albums: Carly Simon No Secrets.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The singer-songwriter discusses her life and career, reflecting on her time with ex-husband James Taylor, a heroin addict when they first met. She also recounts her number of highly public affairs in the early 1970s and how her experience fed into the 1972 album's most famous song, You're So Vain, performing the missing fourth verse on the piano - the first time she has ever sung it along with the melody. Plus, footage of Simon and Taylor Swift performing You're So Vain together, and extracts from an interview where Swift talks about her love for the song.(n)</desc>

Jonathan Dimbleby looks at how it provided a counterpoint to Nazi propaganda and a source of coded information for resistance groups. He also discusses how BBC correspondents were embedded with military units during D-Day, and recalls his own father's reporting on the liberation of Belsen and the fall of Berlin.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Genesis: Together &amp; Apart</title>
    <desc lang="en">Many schoolboys get together to form a band, but few of them go on to become multi-million-selling recording artists - but that's what happened to Genesis. Its core members - Peter Gabriel, Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks - met at Charterhouse, a public school in Surrey, and began playing together with two other students in 1967. A few years and personnel changes later (including the addition of drummer Phil Collins) and the classic line-up was in place. But relationships within the band were fraught; Gabriel left for a solo career in 1975, and Rutherford, Collins, Banks and Steve Hackett carried on without him. Here, they're back together again to discuss their careers. Rare archive footage helps tell the story.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A few years ago a team of researchers discovered a mass grave at Stonehenge and in March 2016 its members announced the details of their find - they had unearthed the cremated and fractured remains of an estimated 63 skeletons. This event promised to overturning the debate about why or how this mysterious monument was built, as it now seems the site began as a Neolithic graveyard. A further important question hangs over the bodies, the answer to which has the potential to reveal much more about Stonehenge's nature - including whether or not it was a pilgrimage site - as archaeologists seek to discover where these people came from.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Documentary series about people living on benefits, including 60-year-old Avril, who is one of the long-term unemployed.

Steve has just returned to the UK from Turkey and at 56 is facing unemployment for the first time in his life, and transgender Jess finds jobseeking difficult while she undergoes her transitional medical treatment.(n)</desc>

Emilio (Miguel Varoni) and Alejandro (Fernando Colunga) have hatched a plan for the perfect crime, but in order to carry out their caper the diabolical duo will need a crack crew who can stealthily inject themselves into the inner circle of their wealthy mark. Moctesuma Valdez is a man of power with many personal servants, and if Emilio and Alejandro's team can simply assume the guise of gardener, maid, or chauffer, they will be in the perfect position to strike when Valdez least expects it. When the skilled members of the regular team all reject the plan, Emilio and Alejandro are forced to hire "real" immigrants to get the job done. From electronics expert Julio to father/daughter transportation team Rafa and Rafaela and skilled disguise artist Miguelito it seems as if all of the elements have come together, but what to make of a crew who has all of the qualifications and no actual criminal experience?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Comedian Andy Kaufman gave performances that were bizarre and difficult to categorize, in which he might do or say almost anything: show cartoons, impersonate Elvis Presley, play conga drums while singing children's songs, read aloud from The Great Gatsby, or take the audience out for milk and cookies. Written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski and directed by Milos Forman (the team behind The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996)), this biopic takes an in-depth look at Kaufman's life and art, with Jim Carrey as Kaufman, who could (and would) be any number of different people onstage: the quiet and childlike man, the little foreign guy, the overbearing showbiz "professional," the violently obnoxious wrestler, or the world's worst lounge singer. As Kaufman rose from comedy clubs to guest appearances on Saturday Night Live and a spot on the TV sitcom Taxi, his performances became more complex and dangerous -- so much so that when word got out in 1984 that he was suffering from lung cancer, many fans and associates thought it was just another bizarre stunt; the disease took his life later that year. Man on the Moon features Danny De Vito as Kaufman's manager George Shapiro, Courtney Love as his girlfriend Lynne Margulies, Paul Giamatti as his friend Bob Zmuda, and David Letterman, Judd Hirsch, Marilu Henner, Carol Kane, and Christopher Lloyd as themselves(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A pair of professional thieves find their complex plan to take a millionaire and popular television guru for all he's worth complicated by the fact that their old crew wants no part of the high-risk job in director Joe Menendez's tense crime caper. Emilio (Miguel Varoni) and Alejandro (Fernando Colunga) have hatched a plan for the perfect crime, but in order to carry out their caper the diabolical duo will need a crack crew who can stealthily inject themselves into the inner circle of their wealthy mark. Moctesuma Valdez is a man of power with many personal servants, and if Emilio and Alejandro's team can simply assume the guise of gardener, maid, or chauffer, they will be in the perfect position to strike when Valdez least expects it. When the skilled members of the regular team all reject the plan, Emilio and Alejandro are forced to hire "real" immigrants to get the job done. From electronics expert Julio to father/daughter transportation team Rafa and Rafaela and skilled disguise artist Miguelito it seems as if all of the elements have come together, but what to make of a crew who has all of the qualifications and no actual criminal experience?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Comedian Andy Kaufman gave performances that were bizarre and difficult to categorize, in which he might do or say almost anything: show cartoons, impersonate Elvis Presley, play conga drums while singing children's songs, read aloud from The Great Gatsby, or take the audience out for milk and cookies. Written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski and directed by Milos Forman (the team behind The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996)), this biopic takes an in-depth look at Kaufman's life and art, with Jim Carrey as Kaufman, who could (and would) be any number of different people onstage: the quiet and childlike man, the little foreign guy, the overbearing showbiz "professional," the violently obnoxious wrestler, or the world's worst lounge singer. As Kaufman rose from comedy clubs to guest appearances on Saturday Night Live and a spot on the TV sitcom Taxi, his performances became more complex and dangerous -- so much so that when word got out in 1984 that he was suffering from lung cancer, many fans and associates thought it was just another bizarre stunt; the disease took his life later that year. Man on the Moon features Danny De Vito as Kaufman's manager George Shapiro, Courtney Love as his girlfriend Lynne Margulies, Paul Giamatti as his friend Bob Zmuda, and David Letterman, Judd Hirsch, Marilu Henner, Carol Kane, and Christopher Lloyd as themselves(n)</desc>

To show his appreciation, Pacelli gives Darrell a job -- serving as bodyguard for this beautiful daughter, Dolly (Emmanuelle Chriqui). A short-lived romance blooms between Darrell and Dolly, but it isn't long before the couple are quarreling, which makes Pacelli more than a bit unhappy with his new hire. However, Pacelli also has a mob war and a disloyal and ambitious young lieutenant to deal with, and Darrell soon finds Pacelli's problems become his problems too.

    <title lang="en">Texas Rangers</title>
    <desc lang="en">The true story of the formation of the Texas Rangers provides the backdrop for this youth-oriented Western. In 1875, after the Civil War, Leander McNelly (Dylan McDermott) organizes the Texas Rangers to battle the outlaws terrorizing Texas, notably crime kingpin John King Fisher (Alfred Molina). With a team of experienced gunmen (Robert Patrick and Randy Travis) and enthusiastic but green recruits (James Van Der Beek, Usher Raymond, and Ashton Kutcher), McNelly and his Rangers bring law and order to the wild Texas plains; McNelly must also keep order among his charges when two rangers fall in love with the same woman, Caroline Dukes (Rachael Leigh Cook). Tom Skerritt and Vincent Spano are also featured in the supporting cast; the screenplay, adapted from a script by John Milius, was at one time set to be filmed by Sam Peckinpah, shortly before the legendary Western director's death in 1984(n)</desc>

The makers of Duff Beer hold a contest to find America's best bartenders, with the winners appearing in their upcoming calendar, and Moe Szyslak (voice of Hank Azaria) takes first prize, but when he gets a copy of the finished calendar, Moe discovers his face has been covered with several stickers to obscure his unattractive appearance. Tired of being judged for his ugliness, Moe invests in an aggressive round of plastic surgery, and comes out looking like a matinee idol. In his younger days, Moe had dreams of being an actor, but was turned down for a role on the soap opera It Never Ends due to his looks; he stops by the offices of the producers to show them they missed out on a great opportunity, and they add Moe to the cast on the spot. Moe enjoys great success on the show until he gets an advanced plot outline that shows his character is being written out of future episodes; with the help of his pal Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta), they set out to wreck revenge on the show's staff, though (as one might expect) their plan backfires. "Pygmoelian" was first aired on February 27, 2000(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</title>
    <desc lang="en">New Zealand filmmaker Peter Jackson fulfills his lifelong dream of transforming author J.R.R. Tolkien's best-selling fantasy epic into a three-part motion picture that begins with this holiday 2001 release. Elijah Wood stars as Frodo Baggins, a Hobbit resident of the medieval "Middle-earth" who discovers that a ring bequeathed to him by beloved relative and benefactor Bilbo (Ian Holm) is in fact the "One Ring," a device that will allow its master to manipulate dark powers and enslave the world. Frodo is charged by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) to return the ring to Mount Doom, the evil site where it was forged millennia ago and the only place where it can be destroyed. Accompanying Frodo is a fellowship of eight others: his Hobbit friends Sam (Sean Astin), Merry (Dominic Monaghan), and Pippin (Billy Boyd); plus Gandalf; the human warriors Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and Boromir (Sean Bean); Elf archer Legolas (Orlando Bloom); and Dwarf soldier Gimli (John Rhys-Davies). The band's odyssey to the dreaded land of Mordor, where Mount Doom lies, takes them through the Elfish domain of Rivendell and the forest of Lothlorien, where they receive aid and comfort from the Elf princess Arwen (Liv Tyler), her father, Elrond (Hugo Weaving), and Queen Galadriel (Cate Blanchett). In pursuit of the travelers and their ring are Saruman (Christopher Lee) -- a traitorous wizard and kin, of sorts, to Gandalf -- and the Dark Riders, under the control of the evil, mysterious Sauron (Sala Baker). The Fellowship must also do battle with a troll, flying spies, Orcs, and other deadly obstacles both natural and otherwise as they draw closer to Mordor. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) was filmed in Jackson's native New Zealand, closely followed by its pair of sequels, The Two Towers (2002) and The Return of the King (2003)(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The four heat-winners enter the quarter-final, the Critic's Brief, in which they come up with two dishes based on the simple instructions of this week's guest judge - chef-turned-food critic Charles Campion. For the main, he asks for a classic British dish or a genuine Indian one, and for the dessert, insists on a pudding that the customer finds overwhelming. Once the food is ready, Charles faces each amateur in turn to give them his honest opinion, along with John Torode and Gregg Wallace. But which one will fail to make the knockout week?.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">John Torode and Gregg Wallace put five more keen cooks to the test in the fourth and final week of heats, and as usual they begin by serving up their Calling Card, a dish that showcases their talents. The judges' two favourites then sit it out while the others reinvent what they've just made, creating a new plate of food based on the main ingredient from the first round. After this cook-off, one of the amateurs is sent home, before the remaining four prepare dinner for a trio of former MasterChef champions and runners-up, after which Friday's first two quarter-finalists will be decided.(n)</desc>

Lena is an orphan, and she's come to stay with her mysterious uncle, Macon Ravenwood (Irons), the patriarch of her powerful family. Powerful, because The Ravenwood clan are Casters, born with powers that ordinary mortals don't have, like the ability to move objects, control the elements, and even step out of normal space and time to communicate only with each other. But just as Lena feels ready to open up to Ethan, she discovers that their love is in imminent danger, because when female Casters turn 16, their destiny as either good or evil is revealed. Unwilling to let her nature be dictated by forces outside her control, Lena and Ethan set out together to uncover the strange, secret lore of their families' intertwined histories dating back to the Civil War, and figure out how to grant Lena the power to choose her own destiny(n)</desc>

Lena is an orphan, and she's come to stay with her mysterious uncle, Macon Ravenwood (Irons), the patriarch of her powerful family.

    <desc lang="en">The youngest child of the family often has the most problems -- so why should things be different for the Prince of Darkness and his offspring? Satan (Harvey Keitel) is considering retirement, and is pondering which of his sons should take over the family business -- ambitious Adrian (Rhys Ifans), strapping Cassius (Tommy "Tiny" Lister Jr.), or Nicky (Adam Sandler), an accident-prone demon who prefers to stay in his room playing his favorite heavy metal tunes. When Satan decides to stay on for another 10,000 years, Adrian is outraged, and leaves Hell to go to New York, where he and Cassius attempt to round up enough souls to vote Satan out of power. Satan, understandably upset, sends Nicky to bring Adrian and Cassius back home, but Nicky finds life on Earth is more complicated than he expected. Things don't get any easier when he develops a crush on Valerie (Patricia Arquette), a good-hearted mortal woman. Little Nicky also features Michael McKean as a city official trying to put Nicky behind bars, Kevin Nealon as Hell's gatekeeper, Rodney Dangerfield as Satan's father, Robert Smigel as the voice of Beefy -- a talking dog who is Nicky's guide on earth, Allen Covert as Todd -- Nicky's new roommate, and Peter Dante and Jonathan Loughran as a pair of metalheads who dig Satan.

    <title lang="en">Little Nicky</title>
    <desc lang="en">The youngest child of the family often has the most problems -- so why should things be different for the Prince of Darkness and his offspring? Satan (Harvey Keitel) is considering retirement, and is pondering which of his sons should take over the family business -- ambitious Adrian (Rhys Ifans), strapping Cassius (Tommy "Tiny" Lister Jr.), or Nicky (Adam Sandler), an accident-prone demon who prefers to stay in his room playing his favorite heavy metal tunes. When Satan decides to stay on for another 10,000 years, Adrian is outraged, and leaves Hell to go to New York, where he and Cassius attempt to round up enough souls to vote Satan out of power. Satan, understandably upset, sends Nicky to bring Adrian and Cassius back home, but Nicky finds life on Earth is more complicated than he expected. Things don't get any easier when he develops a crush on Valerie (Patricia Arquette), a good-hearted mortal woman. Little Nicky also features Michael McKean as a city official trying to put Nicky behind bars, Kevin Nealon as Hell's gatekeeper, Rodney Dangerfield as Satan's father, Robert Smigel as the voice of Beefy -- a talking dog who is Nicky's guide on earth, Allen Covert as Todd -- Nicky's new roommate, and Peter Dante and Jonathan Loughran as a pair of metalheads who dig Satan.

    <desc lang="en">Spike Lee and his siblings Cinque Lee and Joie Lee co-wrote this nostalgic but unglamorized look at a family growing up in Brooklyn in the 1970s, inspired by their own childhood. Woody Carmichael (Delroy Lindo) is a jazz musician whose career is in a slump; he once made a good living as a session musician, but he has moved away from it to devote himself to more serious music, a choice that has not worked out well from a financial standpoint. His wife Carolyn (Alfre Woodard) works as a school teacher to keep food on the table. The Carmichaels have five children, a bright and introspective daughter named Troy (Zelda Harris) and four sons with a habit of causing trouble, and they all share an apartment in a brownstone in Brooklyn. Crooklyn follows the Carmichaels as the kids learn the funny and painful lessons of growing up, Mom and Dad balance their love for each other against the financial and personal difficulties of the creative life, and they all try to get along with the often eccentric neighbors on their block. Crooklyn's soundtrack is enlivened by classic 70s R&amp;B hits, including selections by Sly and the Family Stone, The Jackson Five, Curtis Mayfield, The Staple Singers, and The Chambers Brothers(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Hollywood Ending</title>
    <desc lang="en">A down-on-his luck auteur gets one more chance at the big time -- provided his neuroses don't swallow him whole -- in Woody Allen's 33rd feature release, Hollywood Ending. Allen plays Val Waxman, a one-time cinematic genius who's resorted to taking advertisement work to pay the bills for himself and his airhead live-in girlfriend, Lori (Debra Messing). Val finds his luck is about to change, however, when he receives the script for The City Never Sleeps, a period noir set against the backdrop of 1940s New York City. It seems his ex-wife, Ellie (Tea Leoni), now an executive at Galaxy Pictures, has been pulling for him to direct the picture, claiming he's the only man who can do justice to the script. She even manages to convince her boyfriend, Hal (Treat Williams), Galaxy's high-powered studio head, to take a chance on Val's "unique vision." Just when the cameras are ready to roll, however, Val finds that unique vision in jeopardy -- literally -- as he's struck with a psychosomatic case of blindness. When physicians and psychiatrists fail to cure him, Val contrives a scheme to forge ahead with the picture, for fear of blowing his one last chance at greatness. Hollywood Ending co-stars George Hamilton and Mark Rydell(n)</desc>

Dick and Marge Nelson are an average middle-aged couple who have been married for twenty rather uneventful years. Far, far away in a remote corner of the galaxy, the Nelsons are being watched by the paranoid emperor of a tiny planet named Spengo. Tod Spengo has taken a shine to Marge, particularly when she exercises to jazz music in her back yard. Spengo postpones his planned destruction of Earth by one day so that he can lift Marge to safety and then marry her, but what he hasn't counted on is the humans' determination to save their own planet. And, once on Spengo itself, Dick and Marge are in the perfect position to foil the emperor's attempts to annihilate the Earth(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Upon acquiring a mysterious book in which the number 23 seems to take on powerful cosmic significance, a once-sane man gradually becomes obsessed with the idea that the frequently recurring number may in fact hold a deadly secret in this intense mystery-thriller starring Jim Carrey and Virginia Madsen, and directed by Joel Schumacher. Walter Sparrow (Carrey) is a middle-aged dogcatcher whose wife Agatha (Madsen) has bestowed him with an obscure mystery novel detailing the investigation launched by a tough-talking gumshoe named Fingerling (also Carrey) whose every move seems to be overshadowed by the enigmatic eponymous number. After noting a series of alarming parallels shared between the fictional detective and himself, Walter is quickly drawn in to the story as the hard-boiled private investigator murders raven-wigged moll Fabrizia (also Madsen) and pins the crime on her unsuspecting lover (Danny Huston). Back in the real world, fiction seems to merge with reality as Walter and Agatha's close friend Isaac (also Huston) begins to ingratiate himself ever deeper into the couple's relationship and Walter begins experiencing a gruesome series of visions in which he violently murders an unfaithful Agatha. His mind fast descending into a dark and violent whirlwind of madness, Walter enlists the aid of Agatha and the pair's adolescent son Robin (Logan Lerman) in seeking out the author of the mysterious tome and uncovering the sinister truth behind the so-called "23 enigma."(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Nick Knowles comes to the aid of Liz and Jason Liversidge, a Hull couple in desperate need of help in future-proofing their family home. Not long after getting married and starting a family, Jason was diagnosed with both Fabrys disease, which causes a build-up of poisonous toxins in the body, and Motor Neurone Disease, which drastically reduced his life expectancy. The pair also discovered that Jason would have passed Fabrys disease on to his two daughters, which means that once her husband is gone, Liz will need all the help she can get in managing her children's condition. Nick joins forces with designer Oliver Heath and an army of volunteers to put together a home in which Jason can build meaningful memories with his girls, but one which also gives Liz the best chance of providing for their future needs.(n)</desc>

Not long after getting married and starting a family, Jason was diagnosed with both Fabrys disease, which causes a build-up of poisonous toxins in the body, and Motor Neurone Disease, which drastically reduced his life expectancy. The pair also discovered that Jason would have passed Fabrys disease on to his two daughters, which means that once her husband is gone, Liz will need all the help she can get in managing her children's condition. Nick joins forces with designer Oliver Heath and an army of volunteers to put together a home in which Jason can build meaningful memories with his girls, but one which also gives Liz the best chance of providing for their future needs.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Creatures of the night find new prey on the scariest night of the year in this horror story. It's Halloween night, and four friends -- Allison (Vanessa Horneff), Elliott (Wil Horneff), Trevor (Karl Jacob), and Brian (Sean Reid) -- are on a road trip en route to a friend's wedding when their car breaks down after running into something. Looking for help, the four happen upon the farmhouse of an elderly couple, Elvin (Richard Little) and May (Barbara Wilhide), which is located next to a huge barn. Elvin and May have already become lost in the darkness of the barn, and soon two of the lost travelers are suffering the same fate as they search for friendly strangers. However, while they can barely see a hand in front of their face, they discover they're not alone in the barn, which has become home to a huge swarm of bloodthirsty bats. The Roost is framed by an introduction and postscript from a television horror show host, played by Tom Noonan(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">After an excruciatingly humiliating in-flight experience that culminated in a messy breakup and the untimely death of a dog, Nashawn Wade (Kevin Hart) sues the airline for all it's worth. This turns out to be a more than profitable move on his part; the lawsuit brings him a settlement in the hefty amount of 600 million dollars. Eager to prevent his experience from happening to another -- and perfectly willing to reap the financial benefits of the cash cow he believes his plan to be -- Nashawn decides to launch NWA, an all African American airline complete with sensuous stewardesses, an onboard dance club, and a bathroom attendant. Far be it from giving "flying the friendly skies" a new meaning, however, chaos ensues in the form of a white family with the unfortunate last name of Hunkee. The Hunkee patriarch (as played by Tom Arnold) and his antics prevent the flight from going as smoothly as intended.

    <title lang="en">Deliver Us From Eva</title>
    <desc lang="en">Three men discover that meddling in their sister-in-law's love life only makes their own lives more complicated in this romantic comedy. Eva Dandridge (Gabrielle Union) developed a sense of responsibility early on in life, when after the death of her parents she was left to care for her three younger sisters, Kareenah (Essence Atkins), Bethany (Robinne Lee), and Jacqui (Meagan Good). All four of the Dandridge sisters have grown up to be attractive, intelligent, and successful; Kareenah is happily married to Tim (Mel Jackson), while Bethany is engaged to Michael (Duane Martin), and Jacqui is going steady with Darrell (Dartanyan Edmonds). However, Eva still watches over her siblings like a hawk, and while her sisters love Eva dearly, Tim, Michael, and Darrell wish their sister-in-law would stay out of their business. The guys decide that if Eva had a boyfriend, she might be less interested in running other people's lives, and they turn to Ray (LL Cool J), a notorious ladies' man, for help. Ray is short on cash, so the guys make him a deal -- they'll give him 5,000 dollars to romance Eva, sweep her off her feet, and then dump her a few weeks later. Ray agrees, and while getting past her no-nonsense demeanor takes some doing, before long she's head over heels for him. However, Ray unexpectedly finds himself falling in love with Eva, and Eva, when offered a job in another town, decides to stay on to be with Ray. Even worse, the other Dandridge sisters are so impressed with the romantic Ray that they start demanding a bit more TLC from their own men(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Truth About Cats &amp; Dogs</title>
    <desc lang="en">A distaff twist on Cyrano de Bergerac, Michael Lehmann's romantic comedy The Truth About Cats and Dogs stars the brilliant Janeane Garofalo as Abby Barnes, the lonely host of a daily pet-care radio show. When an enamored listener, photographer Brian (portrayed by Ben Chaplin), asks Abby on a date, her insecurities get the better of her and she describes herself as a six-foot-tall blonde, a description matching her ingenue neighbor Noelle (Uma Thurman). Ultimately, an unwitting Brian falls for Noelle's body but Abby's mind, a dilemma jeopardizing the future happiness of all three. Lehmann's direction is light and graceful, but The Truth About Cats and Dogs belongs primarily to screenwriter Audrey Wells and the superb cast. Garofalo's performance is a star-making comic turn, and Thurman, so often a remote and distant actress, is at her warmest and most engaging(n)</desc>

Mike Holland (Nick Cannon) is nineteen years old and has just completed his basic training as a private in the United States Marine Corps. Mike has a four-day leave so he can visit his family for Thanksgiving, and then has orders for combat duty in Iraq. Mike wants to spend time with his family and friends before he ships out, but he doesn't want to tell anyone that he'll be stationed in Iraq. While taking the bus home to Bakersfield, California, Mike meets Cristina (Melonie Diaz), and it doesn't take long for him to realize he's infatuated with her. Mike makes a date to spend some time with Cristina, but he already has a busy schedule over the next four days. Mike catches up with his little sister (Erica Gluck), his doting mother (April Grace) and her taciturn new husband (Tom Sizemore), and sees his estranged father (Chi McBride) for the first time in years. Mike also hangs out with his best friend Jake (Matt O'Leary), but discovers he's begun taking a different path in life while Mike was in boot camp. And Mike happens to meet a disabled soldier back from Iraq (Jay Hernandez) who gives him an idea of what he can expect during his tour of duty.

    <title lang="en">Devil</title>
    <desc lang="en">Forced into a corner, backs against the wall - a season of action, suspense and dread in confined surroundings. Supernatural chiller starring Chris Messina as a cop who discovers that four people are trapped in a lift with the Devil incarnate. Dowdle and screenwriter Brian Nelson tackle the first instalment of "The Night Chronicles," a film series in which up-and-coming filmmakers bring to life stories conceived by M. Night Shyamalan. Devil opens as five Philadelphia office workers file into the lift of an office building. A security guard - who can see, but not hear, what's going on in the suspended box - tries to convince the cop on the case that one of the passengers is the Devil, taking human form in his quest to collect sinners. As emergency workers frantically try to open the lift, secrets are revealed and the five realise that their only hope for survival is to confess their darkest sins in front of the others(n)</desc>

Exploring the town, Bob and Millie discover that most of the buildings are constucted of papier-mâché, and that the train that pulls up at the station travels only in a circle. Even worse, the Fraziers are plagued by the echoing laughter of a small child. Written by Earl Hamner, Jr., this late Twilight Zone entry was economically filmed on the familiar MGM backlot #2 (look closely, and you'll recognize Andy Hardy's house).

    <title lang="en">Shutter Island</title>
    <desc lang="en">Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio team up for a fourth time for this adaptation of Shutter Island, a novel by Dennis Lehane (Mystic River). The film opens in 1954 as World War II veteran and current federal marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his new partner, Chuck (Mark Ruffalo), ferry to Shutter Island, a water-bound mental hospital housing the criminally insane. They have been asked to investigate the disappearance of Rachel Solando (Emily Mortimer), a patient admitted to the asylum after she murdered her three children. As Teddy quizzes Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley), the head of the institution, he begins to suspect that the authorities in charge might not be giving him the whole truth, and that a terrible fate may befall all the patients in the spooky Ward C -- a unit devoted to the most heinous of the hospital's inmates. Complicating matters further, Teddy has a secret of his own -- the arsonist who murdered his wife is incarcerated on Shutter Island. Driven to confront his wife's killer, and stranded on the island because of a hurricane, Teddy must unravel the secrets of the eerie place before succumbing to his own madness. Max von Sydow, Emily Mortimer, Michelle Williams, Patricia Clarkson, and Jackie Earle Haley round out the supporting cast(n)</desc>
