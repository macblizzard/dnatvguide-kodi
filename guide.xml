Jackson star, respectively, as Gavin Banek and Doyle Gibson, two New York men whose lives become accidentally intertwined in a Good Friday fender bender on the FDR Drive. Late for a crucial appointment, hotshot lawyer Gavin tosses Doyle a blank check and leaves the scene, while Doyle, whose car is inoperable, is late for a court-appointed custody hearing. A recovering alcoholic, Doyle's tardiness doesn't sit well with the judge, who - sick of waiting for Gipson - grants custody to Doyle's ex-wife in Doyle's absence. The situation worsens when it becomes evident that Doyle has an equally important file belonging to Gavin, which proves that an elderly man gave Banek's firm power-of-attorney over his foundation. So begins an escalating war of words and deeds between the two men. Soon, egged on by an associate, Gavin hires a "fixer" to destroy Doyle's credit, forcing Doyle to fire back with some cunning moves of his own(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Comedian Andy Kaufman gave performances that were bizarre and difficult to categorize, in which he might do or say almost anything: show cartoons, impersonate Elvis Presley, play conga drums while singing children's songs, read aloud from The Great Gatsby, or take the audience out for milk and cookies. Written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski and directed by Milos Forman (the team behind The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996)), this biopic takes an in-depth look at Kaufman's life and art, with Jim Carrey as Kaufman, who could (and would) be any number of different people onstage: the quiet and childlike man, the little foreign guy, the overbearing showbiz "professional," the violently obnoxious wrestler, or the world's worst lounge singer. As Kaufman rose from comedy clubs to guest appearances on Saturday Night Live and a spot on the TV sitcom Taxi, his performances became more complex and dangerous -- so much so that when word got out in 1984 that he was suffering from lung cancer, many fans and associates thought it was just another bizarre stunt; the disease took his life later that year. Man on the Moon features Danny De Vito as Kaufman's manager George Shapiro, Courtney Love as his girlfriend Lynne Margulies, Paul Giamatti as his friend Bob Zmuda, and David Letterman, Judd Hirsch, Marilu Henner, Carol Kane, and Christopher Lloyd as themselves(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Casanova</title>
    <desc lang="en">History's most renowned ladies' man finally meets his match in this historical romance laced with comedy and adventure. In Venice in 1753, Giacomo Casanova (Heath Ledger) is a notorious playboy whose way with women goes too far when he's caught leaving the bedroom of a novice nun, and one of the leading prosecutors of the Inquisition, Pucci (Jeremy Irons), puts him on trial. The Doge (Tim McInnerny), Venice's political point man, is a friend of Casanova's and pulls strings to get him off the hook and allow him to stay in the city, but under one condition -- he must take a wife and remain faithful to her. Casanova sets his sights on Victoria (Natalie Dormer), a lovely young maiden who is obviously taken with the handsome ladykiller, but he's not the only one who wants her hand. Giovanni Bruni (Charlie Cox) is a young man who is very much in love with Victoria, and in order to move him out of the picture, Casanova challenges him to a duel. However, when Casanova is bested in swords in the challenge, he discovers he's actually been parrying with Giovanni's sister, Francesca (Sienna Miller). As Casanova gets to know Francesca, he discovers she's a gifted writer and a bright and independent woman as well as a good hand with a sword, and he comes to the realization that she's the woman he wants to take to the altar. However, Francesca has already been promised to the vain and chubby Papprizzio (Oliver Platt), a man she's never met, and she doesn't seem at all interested in the notorious Casanova. Casanova also stars Lena Olin, and Omid Djalili(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Anything Else</title>
    <desc lang="en">A young artist struggling with his career and his muse is getting more than a little aggravation from Cupid in this romantic comedy written and directed by Woody Allen. Jerry Falk (Jason Biggs) is a promising 21-year-old comedy writer living in New York City. While Jerry has talent, he's having a hard time getting his career off the ground, which might have something to do with the fact his agent Harvey (Danny DeVito) is a well-meaning, but ineffectual, blowhard, and his mentor David Dobel (Allen) is an increasingly paranoid eccentric whose twin careers as a teacher and standup comic are both floundering. Poised at the top of Jerry's mountain of anxieties is his relationship with his girlfriend Amanda (Christina Ricci); from the first moment he saw her, Jerry has been in love with her, but Amanda's multiple neuroses, fear of commitment, and frustrating intimacy issues make her all but impossible to be around. Jerry is approaching his breaking point when the small flat he shares with Amanda becomes home to a third roommate -- Amanda's mother Paula (Stockard Channing), who has decided to come to New York to chase her dream of becoming a cabaret singer. Anything Else also features supporting performances from Jimmy Fallon, William Hill, and jazz vocalist Diana Krall(n)</desc>

Cher (Alicia Silverstone) and Dionne (Stacey Dash), both named after "great singers of the past that now do infomercials," are pampered upper-class girls who care less about getting good grades than wearing the right clothes and being as popular as possible. But Cher, who lives with her tough yet warm-hearted lawyer dad (Dan Hedaya) and hunky, sensitive stepbrother (Paul Rudd), also has an innate urge to help those less fortunate -- like the two introverted teachers she brings together ("negotiating" herself improved grades in the process) and new friend Tai (Brittany Murphy), who starts out a geek and ends up a Cher prodigy. Cher also possesses her own sensitive side, and she is looking for the perfect boyfriend, whom she ends up finding where she least expected(n)</desc>

Documentary telling the full story of World War II with the aid of rare and unseen archive footage, recently released official documents and modern techniques of colouring and satellite mapping. Germany took just four weeks to conquer Poland, using a new form of warfare - Blitzkrieg. Six armoured tank units known as Panzer divisions, supported by the Luftwaffe, quickly broke through Polish defences and were so successful that Hitler also used them against the Allies. Despite superior men and equipment, France and England had not learned the lessons of the Polish defeat and were utterly at a loss how to counter such attacks. (Followed by News)(n)</desc>

A visit to the British museum raises evidence that this could be a lost treasure once belonging to France's last king and queen, and they head for Normandy to inspect a stained glass window in the image of a lost Delaroche painting - but they also begin to suspect it is a copy, rather than the original.(n)</desc>

George schemes to further his political ambitions, and when he learns of Ross' plan, he uses it as a means to discredit his rival, accusing him of recklessness - a charge that may prove true when the rescue mission proves to have fatal consequences.(n)</desc>

Agnieszka Radwanska was the highest-seeded casualty in the ladies draw on this day last year, as she fell to a 6-3, 5-7, 9-7 defeat to the number 19 seed, Dominika Cibulkova. That match was not the only epic encounter to take place on court number three, as Russia's Elena Vesnina battled to a 5-7, 6-1, 9-7 triumph over her compatriot Ekaterina Makarova, to set up a quarter-final against Dominika Cibulkova. Over on centre court, eventual champion Serena Williams recorded a fairly one-sided 7-5, 6-0 win over Svetlana Kuznetsova, while perhaps the standout contest of the day saw Simona Halep face Madison Keys on Number One court, with the former eventually coming out on top by a score of 6-7, 6-4, 6-3.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Steve McAndrew brings his dying father to London so he can spend his final days in a nearby hospice, but how much time he can spend with his parent is anyone's guess - the Ucos team is hard at work investigating the cold case murder of 55-year-old interpreter Agnes Bradley. A DNA sample provides a link to a rebellious teenager, and the team wonders if the killer could be related to him. But a whole new can of worms is opened when investigators discover the lad's mother was raped - could the same person have killed Agnes? Gerry and Steve hope that interviewing her friends from a local chess club may shed new light on the matter, but it's a possible professional issue that could hold the key to unlocking the mystery. Denis Lawson and Dennis Waterman star.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Navy SEALs</title>
    <desc lang="en">This exercise in patriotic, high-tech action centers on a select group of Navy commandos and their battles against a Middle East terrorist group. This particular squadron is led by a pair of rivals: cocky, fiery Hawkins (Charlie Sheen) and stoic, unflappable Curran (Michael Biehn). When an anti-terrorist mission goes awry, allowing an enemy leader to escape with a supply of stolen American missiles, both men are certain that, given another chance, they can redeem themselves and the squad. Their rivalry plays out against a background of high-powered amphibious battles, allowing the film to revel in dangerous stunts and advanced weaponry. Joanne Whalley-Kilmer provides brief romantic relief as a journalist with important information, but the focus remains on the macho interplay between Hawkins and Curran. Co-written by former Navy Seal Chuck Pfarrer (with Gary Goldman), the film presents authentic details about the elite unit, but the bulk of Navy Seals tends to rely on familiar combat film conventions. Viewers seeking rapidly paced action sequences will not be disappointed, though other viewers may be less likely to overlook the predictable storyline and routine characters(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Kevin Kline stars in this smart, funny comedy about a small town schoolteacher who is 'outed' on national television by an ex-student collecting an Oscar.

    <title lang="en">Wet Hot American Summer</title>
    <desc lang="en">1980s teen comedies finally get the parody they so richly deserve with Wet Hot American Summer, the first feature film from writer/director David Wain and co-screenwriter Michael Showalter, formerly of the sketch comedy troupe the State. It's the last day of the summer season at Camp Firewood, and as camp director Beth (Janeane Garofalo) prepares to wrap things up, the staff of teenage counselors realize this is their last chance to do something about the summer romances that have been brewing for the past three months. Sweet but shy Coop (Michael Showalter) is crazy about pretty Katie (Marguerite Moreau), but there's the problem of her severely moody boyfriend Andy (Paul Rudd). Meanwhile, Victor (Ken Marino) is trying to score with sexy Abby (Marisa Ryan), who is known to make friends easily, and McKinley (Michael Ian Black) and Ben (Bradley Cooper) attempt to keep their hot and heavy relationship a secret. Meanwhile, arts and crafts teacher Gail (Molly Shannon) turns to her students for comfort as her marriage falls apart, drama coach Susie (Amy Poehler) tries to whip the talent show into shape with Ben's help, and camp chef Gene (Christopher Meloni) deals with his unique sexual quirks with the help of a talking can of vegetables (voiced by H. Jon Benjamin). Beth even finds time for romance with socially inept astrophysicist Henry (David Hyde Pierce), but first Henry has to save Camp Firewood from a large piece of space junk about to re-enter Earth's atmosphere. Like Wain and Showalter, Ken Marino, Michael Ian Black, and Joe Lo Truglio (who appears in a small role) were also members of the State; fellow State alumnus Kerri Kenney was cast in a supporting role in the film, but her character didn't appear in the final cut(n)</desc>

The series' specialty seemed to be spotlighting eccentric contestants indulging in offbeat sports events with bizarre rules. In each market that the series played, viewers were invited to send in video clips of "crazy stuff never seen on TV" -- especially if "hot girls" were involved (that's what it said on the press release!). Seen on the NBC-owned stations in the larger markets, Whacked Out Sports was initially broadcast on September 7, 2006(n)</desc>

Lisa Simpson (voice of Yeardley Smith) is used to being a misfit, but one day she finds herself overcome by feelings of depression, and nothing she does seems to make her feel better. Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) is concerned, but can't seem to figure out what the matter is, and urges her daughter to ignore her feelings and put on a happy face. Lisa, however, makes friends with local jazz musician Bleeding Gums Murphy (voice of Ron Taylor), who shows her how to work out her bad feelings by playing the blues. Marge, however, isn't so sure that playing blues riffs will really help Lisa in the long run. Meanwhile, Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) has problems with Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright), who has been subjecting Homer to a series of "defeats -- correction, humiliating defeats" on their video boxing game; Homer is convinced he has to start winning if he wants to regain the respect of his son.

Timing is the watchword for the Simpson family when Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) and Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright) learn that the Springfield Speedway will be staging a special thrill-show the same night as Lisa (voice of Yeardley Smith) will be performing a solo in the school band concert. The moment the concert is over, Homer and Bart rush Lisa and Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) into the car, just in time for their car to nearly be swallowed up by Truckasaurus, a robot made from several monster trucks. As part of the show, Bart watches famous daredevil Capt. Lance Murdock (voice of Castellaneta) jump his motorcycle over a tank filled with hungry sharks and man-eating lions. Impressed, Bart begins jumping his skateboard over an increasingly large number of objects, even after an injury earns him a stern warning from Dr. Hibbert (voice of Harry Shearer). Bart decides he needs to stage a truly impressive stunt, and he makes plans to leap over Springfield Gorge; when Homer finds out, he has to find a way to stop his son before he hurts himself.

    <title lang="en">Fracture</title>
    <desc lang="en">A structural engineer (Anthony Hopkins) and an ambitious young district attorney (Ryan Gosling) become locked in a deadly battle of wits when the former is found innocent in the attempted murder of his wife in director Gregory Hoblit's tense tale of courtroom mind games. Ted Crawford (Hopkins) is an engineer who lives with his wife, Jennifer (Embeth Davidtz), in the couple's lavish Southern California home. One day, after carefully planning out the details to ensure that there is no way he can be convicted of murder, Ted shoots his wife in a blatant attempt to kill the woman. When head hostage negotiator Rob Nunally (Billy Burke) arrives on the scene to speak with Ted, he is shocked to find that the victim of the shooting is in fact his longtime lover. Though Jennifer survives the trauma of being shot in the head at close range, she hovers comatose between life and death as star prosecutor Willy Beachum (Gosling) reluctantly accepts the case while preparing to leave the Los Angeles criminal court system behind for a more promising career at a posh private law firm. Though the DA (David Strathairn) vehemently resents Beachum's lofty plan for departure, the hotshot young lawyer remains convinced that he can expedite the apparently open-and-shut case and be on his way to greener pastures in one week's time at the very most. Beachum's swelling ego betrays him, however, as his future boss Nikki Gardner (Rosamund Pike) begins to turn up the heat and fracture mechanics specialist Ted chooses to represent himself at the trial knowing well that a career spent spotting structural flaws in aeronautical systems has instilled him with just the kind of argumentative skills needed to riddle the swaggering young lawyer's "foolproof" case with doubt(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Tom Stoppard provided the witty and intelligent script for John Madden's romantic comedy in which young Will Shakespeare struggles with writer's block and money worries while trying to complete Romeo and Ethel: The Pirate's Daughter. Gwyneth Paltrow once more employs her faultless English accent, playing aristocratic Viola de Lesseps, who is shortly to be married off but yearns to slum it as an actor.

    <title lang="en">Slumdog Millionaire</title>
    <desc lang="en">(2008) Danny Boyle's eight Oscar- and seven BAFTA-winning blockbuster opens as Jamal Malik (Dev Patel), a chaiwalah at a call centre, is on the verge of winning 20 million rupees on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? . But the host of the show, Prem Kumar (Anil Kapoor) is convinced he's cheating and hands him over to the police to beat the truth out of him. Jamal reveals that the right answer to each question has come from a significant part of his life, from when he and his brother Salim were orphaned after their mother was killed in religious violence. As he continues his story, Jamal reveals how he knows each answer; how he fell in love with Latika, an orphaned girl from whom he was later separated; and how his brother Salim took the path of violence as a gangster's gunman. But as Jamal is returned to the studio for the last question, Salim finally repays his brother's trust. As well as the outstanding Patel, Jamal is played in different stages of his life by Tanay Hemant Gharu and Ayush Mahesh Khedekar; Salim is played by Madhur Mittal, Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala and Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail; Latika is played by Frieda Pinto, Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar and Rubina Ali, all of whom turn in stunning performances.

    <title lang="en">Slumdog Millionaire</title>
    <desc lang="en">(2008) Danny Boyle's eight Oscar- and seven BAFTA-winning blockbuster opens as Jamal Malik (Dev Patel), a chaiwalah at a call centre, is on the verge of winning 20 million rupees on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? . But the host of the show, Prem Kumar (Anil Kapoor) is convinced he's cheating and hands him over to the police to beat the truth out of him. Jamal reveals that the right answer to each question has come from a significant part of his life, from when he and his brother Salim were orphaned after their mother was killed in religious violence. As he continues his story, Jamal reveals how he knows each answer; how he fell in love with Latika, an orphaned girl from whom he was later separated; and how his brother Salim took the path of violence as a gangster's gunman. But as Jamal is returned to the studio for the last question, Salim finally repays his brother's trust. As well as the outstanding Patel, Jamal is played in different stages of his life by Tanay Hemant Gharu and Ayush Mahesh Khedekar; Salim is played by Madhur Mittal, Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala and Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail; Latika is played by Frieda Pinto, Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar and Rubina Ali, all of whom turn in stunning performances.

    <title lang="en">Hollywood Ending</title>
    <desc lang="en">A down-on-his luck auteur gets one more chance at the big time -- provided his neuroses don't swallow him whole -- in Woody Allen's 33rd feature release, Hollywood Ending. Allen plays Val Waxman, a one-time cinematic genius who's resorted to taking advertisement work to pay the bills for himself and his airhead live-in girlfriend, Lori (Debra Messing). Val finds his luck is about to change, however, when he receives the script for The City Never Sleeps, a period noir set against the backdrop of 1940s New York City. It seems his ex-wife, Ellie (Tea Leoni), now an executive at Galaxy Pictures, has been pulling for him to direct the picture, claiming he's the only man who can do justice to the script. She even manages to convince her boyfriend, Hal (Treat Williams), Galaxy's high-powered studio head, to take a chance on Val's "unique vision." Just when the cameras are ready to roll, however, Val finds that unique vision in jeopardy -- literally -- as he's struck with a psychosomatic case of blindness. When physicians and psychiatrists fail to cure him, Val contrives a scheme to forge ahead with the picture, for fear of blowing his one last chance at greatness. Hollywood Ending co-stars George Hamilton and Mark Rydell(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">August Rush</title>
    <desc lang="en">Kirsten Sheridan's family drama stars Freddie Highmore as Evan Taylor, a musical prodigy searching for his parents. When pregnant cellist Lyla Novacek was hit by a car, her controlling father and manager told her she'd lost the baby; in reality she gave birth prematurely and her father sent the infant to an orphanage. Eleven years later, when Evan finds out that his parents are alive, he sets out to find them, taking inspiration from the music around him. The heart of the film is Evan's almost mystical ability to 'feel' music, a challenging concept that is rendered believable thanks to inventive work from the composer of the main score, Mark Mancina. Also starring Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Evan's rock singer father, and Robin Williams as a modern-day Fagin who Evan meets during his search for his family(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Eight brave sled dogs search for the master who is looking for a way to rescue them in this adventure drama. An American geologist (Bruce Greenwood) flies to Antarctica to participate in a project at the United States Research Base, where he teams up with arctic guide Jerry Shepard (Paul Walker) and his best friend, Cooper (Jason Biggs). The scientist soon discovers that Shepard also has eight other valuable friends -- a pack of sled dogs he's worked with for years, who have rescued him from a number of tight spots. As the three men explore a frozen mountain region, an unexpected accident coupled with a massive storm front forces them to fly to safety, leaving the dogs behind. Shepard is determined to rescue his canine friends, but he has to wait until the weather will allow him to travel back to the mountain, while the dogs struggle against the elements to survive as they attempt to make their way back home. Eight Below was inspired by a true story involving Japanese researchers exploring the Antarctic in 1957; the story was made into the film Nankyoku Monogatari(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">August Rush</title>
    <desc lang="en">Kirsten Sheridan's family drama stars Freddie Highmore as Evan Taylor, a musical prodigy searching for his parents. When pregnant cellist Lyla Novacek was hit by a car, her controlling father and manager told her she'd lost the baby; in reality she gave birth prematurely and her father sent the infant to an orphanage. Eleven years later, when Evan finds out that his parents are alive, he sets out to find them, taking inspiration from the music around him. The heart of the film is Evan's almost mystical ability to 'feel' music, a challenging concept that is rendered believable thanks to inventive work from the composer of the main score, Mark Mancina. Also starring Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Evan's rock singer father, and Robin Williams as a modern-day Fagin who Evan meets during his search for his family(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Snow Angels</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director/screenwriter David Gordon Green adapts Stewart O'Nan's popular novel to the screen in this feature, which tells the parallel tales of a teenager named Arthur (Michael Angarano) and his onetime babysitter Annie (Kate Beckinsale) -- whose turbulent relationship with her estranged husband, Glenn (Sam Rockwell), leads the small-town waitress down a troubled path. Arthur is a high-school student from a dysfunctional family, and does everything in his power to avoid hanging around the house while mom and dad quarrel. When he's not practicing his trombone and performing with the high-school marching band, Arthur can usually be found bussing tables at the local Chinese restaurant and flirting with older waitress Annie. Annie used to be Arthur's babysitter, and is currently struggling to separate from her former high-school sweetheart, Glenn. But being a single mother isn't easy, especially since the troubled Glenn wants nothing more than to clean up his act and reunite his family. Back at school, Arthur and pretty classmate Lila (Olivia Thirlby) have been bonding over their mutual love for all things geeky. Though the casual friendship shows promise of evolving into something more when Lila expresses her true feelings for Arthur, he can't help but becoming distracted by his chaotic family life: his father is moving out of the family home, and his mother is doing everything in her power to maintain some semblance of normalcy. Realizing that happiness is fleeting as his family becomes shattered and Annie experiences a series of distressing encounters with Glenn, Arthur gradually begins to fall for Lisa despite his growing cynicism concerning long-term relationships. Later, on a cold winter morning, Glenn and Annie's past catches up with them in a blinding flash, and the lives of everyone they know are suddenly and irrevocably changed(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In 1970s Los Angeles, bumbling private eye Holland March (Ryan Gosling) and muscle-for-hire Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) become unlikely partners when they find themselves both looking for a missing woman named Amelia (Margaret Qualley) following the death of a high-profile porn star. Amelia's ties to the deceased actress are unclear, but as other members of the porn industry turn up dead, March and Healy's investigation reveals a much bigger conspiracy than the duo could have ever anticipated. With the help of March's teenage daughter Holly (Angourie Rice), their sleuthing eventually unearths corruption within the federal government. Shane Black (Iron Man 3) directed and co-wrote this action buddy comedy, which co-stars Kim Basinger and Matt Bomer(n)</desc>

Ordered to take a leave of absence from the police department, Monk hires Sharona, a nurse who helps him try to get reinstated on the force, and in the process, becomes an unlikely Dr. Watson to his Sherlock Holmes. When the police department find themselves unable to crack a high-profile case, they have no choice but to bring back the only man for the job...phobias and all(n)</desc>

Even though she didn't pull the trigger, and was nowhere near when the bullets were fired, Jennifer was sentenced to life without parole. Piers charts the journey through fame and rejection that saw Jennifer descend into a criminal lifestyle, and asks family members and legal experts if they believe her punishment was too harsh.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Hippo Has Landed. June has just begun, but the DeYoung Family Zoo, a privately owned zoo in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, is already well into its busy summer season. Bud and Carrie are always on the go and, on top of all their day-to-day chores, the zoo's largest new arrival is on its way from Jakarta, Indonesia. After an 11,000-mile journey, Wallace, a 400-pound baby hippo, is already proving to Bud and Carrie that he may be a kid, but he's calling all the shots! With a lot of coaxing and the help of some tasty carrots, the DeYoung Family Zoo finally welcomes its new hippo -- now Bud and Carrie just have to feed him! To add to the stress, Carrie has just started a no-kill animal rescue - Piper's Place - and is hoping that a fundraising event will bring in the money she needs. The balloons are up and the cake is cut, but can Carrie raise the thousands of dollars needed to keep Piper's Place afloat?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Joanne Cantwell presents coverage of day four of the European Tour event, held this year at Portstewart Golf Club in Londonderry, Northern Ireland. Several of the leading players at last year's tournament held at the K Club had to conclude their third round on the morning of day four before returning to the course for their final round. Going into that, Rory McIlroy began with a three-stroke lead over his nearest rival, Danny Willett, and a three-under-par round was enough to see him claim this title for the first time in his career. With analysis from John McHenry, reports by Dave Kelly and commentary from Shane O'Donoghue. Includes Nuacht and News with signing.(n)</desc>

The Proteas came out on top in a closely-fought game the last time the sides met for a Test match on this ground. A sublime second-innings century from Hashim Amla was one of the main reasons for that victory - his 121 coming from 205 balls before he was eventually bowled by Steven Finn.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Move over, Gidget -- a new breed of female surfers with style, guts and attitude hit the screen in this feature, which combines romance with a sports drama. Anne Marie (Kate Bosworth) is a young woman living in Hawaii who has been surfing since she was a little girl, and over the past year has been training for the prestigious Pipe Masters surfing competition. But Anne Marie is still dealing with emotional baggage that's holding her back -- her mother abandoned her years ago, leaving her to raise her younger sister Penny (Mika Boorem) while having to guide herself through adolescence, and Anne Marie nearly drowned while trying to surf the famous Maui Pipeline three years ago, and has yet to shake the anxieties of this traumatic event. Anne Marie and Penny share a house with Anne Marie's friends Lena (Sanoe Lake) and Eden (Michelle Rodriguez), both fellow surf enthusiasts, and the three friends work as maids at a hotel, a job which offers them flexible hours for riding the waves. When a pro football team checks into the hotel, Anne Marie meets Matt (Matthew Davis), a promising quarterback who has his eye on her. Anne Marie is just as attracted to Matt as he is to her, but will Anne Marie have to choose between the man of her dreams and the recognition as a surfer she's worked for years to receive? Kate Bosworth, Michelle Rodriguez, and Sanoe Lake did all their own surfing in Blue Crush; Bosworth and Rodriguez went into training to learn the sport before shooting began, while Lake, a native Hawaiian, was already a confirmed surf enthusiast(n)</desc>

When car dealer and one-time crook Terry Leather is approached by his old flame Martine Love with a proposition that would put his money worries behind him for good, he jumps at the chance. Leather quickly assembles a team which digs a tunnel directly into a London bank's vault. But what he hasn't been told is that, in addition to the money, he'll also be stealing a safety box containing material that, if it saw the light of day, would be extremely damaging to the royal family. Another box they take holds further dramatic revelations concerning establishment figures. So it's not long before Leather and the gang are pursued by the police, MI5 and various thugs, all keen to get their hands on the incendiary information..(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Blue Crush</title>
    <desc lang="en">Move over, Gidget -- a new breed of female surfers with style, guts and attitude hit the screen in this feature, which combines romance with a sports drama. Anne Marie (Kate Bosworth) is a young woman living in Hawaii who has been surfing since she was a little girl, and over the past year has been training for the prestigious Pipe Masters surfing competition. But Anne Marie is still dealing with emotional baggage that's holding her back -- her mother abandoned her years ago, leaving her to raise her younger sister Penny (Mika Boorem) while having to guide herself through adolescence, and Anne Marie nearly drowned while trying to surf the famous Maui Pipeline three years ago, and has yet to shake the anxieties of this traumatic event. Anne Marie and Penny share a house with Anne Marie's friends Lena (Sanoe Lake) and Eden (Michelle Rodriguez), both fellow surf enthusiasts, and the three friends work as maids at a hotel, a job which offers them flexible hours for riding the waves. When a pro football team checks into the hotel, Anne Marie meets Matt (Matthew Davis), a promising quarterback who has his eye on her. Anne Marie is just as attracted to Matt as he is to her, but will Anne Marie have to choose between the man of her dreams and the recognition as a surfer she's worked for years to receive? Kate Bosworth, Michelle Rodriguez, and Sanoe Lake did all their own surfing in Blue Crush; Bosworth and Rodriguez went into training to learn the sport before shooting began, while Lake, a native Hawaiian, was already a confirmed surf enthusiast(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Beat</title>
    <desc lang="en">William S. Burroughs' ill-fated performance of his "William Tell act" -- resulting in his wife Joan Vollmer getting a bullet in the brain with a shot glass atop her head -- soon became the stuff of Beat legend. This film, directed by Gary Walkow, traces this doomed romance from its inception to its bloody end. The movie opens in 1944 New York, where Columbia journalism student Vollmer is already living a bohemian life filled with pharmaceuticals and a host of future beatniks, including hunky Jack Kerouac (Daniel Martinez), a young Allen Ginsberg (Ron Livingston), and of course, Burroughs (Kiefer Sutherland). Also frequenting Vollmer's pad is Lucien Carr (Norman Reedus) whom everyone is enamored with, especially Dave Kammerer (Kyle Secor), who winds up dead after trying to jump the object of his affection. Seven years later, Joan and William have married in spite of Burroughs' obvious homosexual predilections. Their domestic bliss is strained when the two have to flee to Mexico City after they get slapped with a drug rap. Ginsberg and Carr, now correspondents for the UPI, visit the couple only to discover that Burroughs split town with his lover-for-hire. Vollmer and the boys decide to go on a road trip that is brimming with heterosexual tension. William eventually returns from his sex-binge suspecting that Joan had a fling with Carr. During that fateful night, Burroughs pulls out a gun that he was going to sell for drug money and performs one of the most spectacularly botched party-tricks in literary history. This film was screened at the 2000 Sundance Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Director Richard Linklater teams with writer Skip Hollandsworth for this darkly comic docudrama detailing the unusual friendship between a likable Texas mortician and a wealthy but reviled widow, and the shocking crime that followed. Inspired by Hollandsworth's 1998 Texas Monthly article that first caught the attention of Linklater, Bernie takes place in Carthage, TX, where effeminate mortician Bernie Tiede (Jack Black) enjoys a reputation as a friendly and upstanding member of the community. Marjorie Nugent (Shirley MacLaine), on the other hand, couldn't hold a lower position on the local social scale. Repressed and bitter, nasty Marjorie has isolated herself from her neighbors, and as a result has been essentially shunned in her small town. The moment Bernie shows Marjorie a shred of kindness, she clings to him tightly and refuses to let go. Meanwhile, as Marjorie becomes Bernie's sugar mama and the pair becomes inseparable, the local rumor mill begins to churn. Eventually, her intense jealousy becomes too much for Bernie to take. When the caustic widow's body is discovered stuffed in her own freezer, local District Attorney Buck Davidson (Matthew McConaughey) vows that justice will be served, but he finds it difficult to build a convincing case against Bernie as the locals rally to his defense(n)</desc>

Chu takes the helm for this Step Up sequel set at the Maryland School for the Arts and following the journey of a rebellious street dancer who struggles to fit in at the prestigious school. Andie (Briana Evigan) may show great promise as a dancer, but she just can't seem to let go of her old life and get a fresh start. With Baltimore's hottest underground dance contest looming on the horizon, Andie joins forces with top dancer Chase (Robert Hoffman) while simultaneously helping to sharpen the skills of her outcast classmates. Perhaps if Andie, Chase, and their talented team of misfit dancers can earn the top slot at The Streets, the troubled new arrival can finally make her dreams a reality while also letting go of the past, and bounding confidently forward into the future(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Young@Heart Chorus is a vocal group from Northampton, MA, who have earned an international reputation for their unique interpretations of songs by Sonic Youth, the Ramones, and the Clash. However, this isn't a teenage garage band attacking the classic punk rock songbook -- the Young@Heart Chorus is comprised of 22 senior citizens whose average age is 80, and under director Bob Cilman they've gained a degree of fame for their enthusiastic a cappella renditions of well-known rock &amp; roll tunes. Filmmaker Stephen Walker spent several weeks with the members of the Young@Heart Chorus as they rehearsed for their annual concert in Northampton, and Young@Heart is a documentary which offers a look at their rigorous rehearsal process, the background of several members, and their efforts to stay active and think positive, even as their friends succumb to old age. Produced for British television, Young@Heart was screened in competition at the 2007 Los Angeles Film Festival(n)</desc>

Terry decides the only womanly thing to do is to get in there and save the man and so she heads into a whole series of unlikely situations. Run-ins with an odd repairman (Jim Belushi), an invalid diplomat, and a KGB mole have her impersonating people like Diana Ross and generally wreaking havoc on the whole spy game.

    <title lang="en">Pure Luck</title>
    <desc lang="en">This wacky buddy comedy was the fifth in a series of Hollywood remakes of films by French director Francis Veber, none of which were box office successes. Sheila Kelley is Valerie Highsmith, an heiress who, despite her family's wealth, suffers from horribly bad luck. On a vacation to Mexico, she takes a fall, causing amnesia, then is mugged and kidnapped for ransom. When her father (Sam Wanamaker) becomes frustrated with the failed attempts of a detective, Ray Campanella (Danny Glover) to find his daughter, he teams a very reluctant Ray with Eugene Proctor (Martin Short), an accountant whose bumbling bad luck is even worse than Valerie's. The theory is that perhaps two such incredibly unlucky people will act like magnets, with Eugene leading Ray to Valerie's location. Although Ray finds Eugene irritating, the unlikely partners eventually begin making surprising progress in the case, despite Eugene's never-ending screw-ups and pratfalls(n)</desc>

However, while Jack is supposed to acting as an assistant to Santa, he has a habit of making things go haywire, and as it happens this is no mistake -- Jack is hoping that an exasperated Santa will quit his position so Jack can take over and finally have a holiday he can bend to his will. Meanwhile, Scott has invited Carol's parents, Bud (Alan Arkin) and Sylvia (Ann-Margaret), over for a long-promised visit, but since he needs to keep his other identity a secret, he and his elves are forced to go to great lengths to convince them that they're actually in Northern Canada.

    <title lang="en">Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai</title>
    <desc lang="en">A surreal crime drama told as only Jim Jarmusch could, Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai stars Forest Whitaker as Ghost Dog, a hit man living in an unidentified but run-down city in what license plates call "The Industrialized State." Known for his gift of being able to come and go without people noticing him, Ghost Dog is a self-taught samurai who is obsessed with order and his strict personal moral code, drawn from the philosophies of the Japanese warriors. As every samurai needs a leader to whom he swears loyalty, Ghost Dog has devoted himself the service of Louie (John Tormey), a low-level crime boss who once saved his life. When Louie's superiors decide he must be executed, Ghost Dog leaps into action, methodically wiping out his many enemies. Along with a dizzying series of stylized shoot-outs, Ghost Dog also features carrier pigeons, characters who read Rashomon, a French-speaking ice cream man, and a score by RZA from the top-selling hip-hop group Wu-Tang Clan, who have their own well-documented obsession with Asian culture. Ghost Dog was screened in competition at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Two Brothers</title>
    <desc lang="en">Like The Bear, director Jean-Jacques Annaud's acclaimed animal picture released 15 years prior, Two Brothers offers a family-friendly epic as told through the eyes of its four-legged protagonists, who, in this case, are sibling tiger cubs Koumal and Sangha. Though a life in the jungles of French colonial Indochina circa the 1920s seemed certain, the cubs are separated shortly after their birth when the notorious hunter Aidan McRory (Guy Pearce) kills their father. Koumal is whisked away to a circus, where he is cruelly beaten into submission and forced to perform tricks to earn his keep. Sangha fares better at first -- he lands in the posh estate of a French government official who wants the big cat to serve as a companion for his lonely son, though a series of unforeseen circumstances ultimately finds Sangha in the hands of a man determined to turn him into an aggressive prizefighter. Understandably, neither tiger is happy with his arrangements, and both escape captivity in hopes of returning to the jungle. Unfortunately for them, the prospect of two loose tigers is hardly comforting for the locals, who quickly demand that McRory kill the cubs before they threaten the safety of the village. Once McRory finds the tigers in their natural habitat, however, he faces a crisis of conscience he hadn't thought possible. Two Brothers also features Jean-Claude Dreyfus and Freddie Highmore(n)</desc>
