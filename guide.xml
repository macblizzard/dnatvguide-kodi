    <title lang="en">Monster's Ball</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Marc Forster, winner of Best Feature at Slamdance for his debut film Loungers (1996) and the "Someone to Watch" Independent Spirit Award for his indie drama Everything Put Together (2000), follows up those acclaimed projects with this intense, racially charged romance. Billy Bob Thornton stars as Georgia prison guard Hank Grotowski, a hard-drinking racist ex-cop whose father, Buck (Peter Boyle), is dying of emphysema and whose son, Sonny (Heath Ledger), works the execution detail at the prison's death row. When Sonny commits suicide, Hank is devastated and quits his job, spiraling into a deep depression until, one night, he comes to the aid of Leticia (Halle Berry), a beautiful African-American woman whose son, Tyrell (Coronji Calhoun), has been hit by a car. When Tyrell dies, Leticia and Hank find themselves to be unexpected soul mates linked together by tragic grief. It's not long before Hank discovers that Leticia is the widow of Lawrence Musgrove (Sean Combs), the man whose execution by electric chair he and his late son helped to orchestrate. Monster's Ball (2001) is based on a screenplay by actors Milo Addica and Will Rokos, who spent five years developing their script into a feature. Their title refers to the name of an English tradition requiring jailers to throw a party for a condemned man on the night before his death(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The EU dictates what farmers are allowed to grow, sets animal welfare standards and offers a large supply of cheap labour to work in the fields and processing plants. In this programme, Tom Heap talks to insiders who claim Brexit will mean higher prices, lower quality and less choice on the supermarket shelves, as well as others who believe it's a fantastic opportunity to address inefficiency and design a new mode of food production for the next generation. Will UK consumers back British farmers, or switch to potentially cheaper imports of hormone-filled meat from abroad?.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Sue Barker introduces further coverage from SW19, where the last-eight of the ladies' singles draw is the main attraction of the day. Two of last year's matches featured seeded players going up against one another on Centre Court for a place in the last-four, and the opening encounter saw Germany's Angelique Kerber record a 7-5, 7-6 victory over Romania's Simona Halep. Following that contest, top seed Serena Williams faced Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, who was appearing in just her third Grand Slam quarter-final, and her first at Wimbledon, but the Russian would sadly see her run come to an end as Williams triumphed 6-4, 6-4. Other matches due to take place today include the quarter-finals in both the men's and ladies doubles competitions.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Day Seven.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Sue Barker introduces the opening coverage of day seven at the All England Club, where the men's and ladies' fourth-round singles matches are due to get under way, while there is also a look back at some of the greatest moments at SW19, on what is the 90th anniversary of the BBC's first radio coverage of the Grand Slam. Agnieszka Radwanska was the highest-seeded casualty in the ladies draw on this day last year, as she fell to a 6-3, 5-7, 9-7 defeat to the number 19 seed, Dominika Cibulkova. That match was not the only epic encounter to take place on court number three, as Russia's Elena Vesnina battled to a 5-7, 6-1, 9-7 triumph over her compatriot Ekaterina Makarova, to set up a quarter-final against Dominika Cibulkova. Over on centre court, eventual champion Serena Williams recorded a fairly one-sided 7-5, 6-0 win over Svetlana Kuznetsova, while perhaps the standout contest of the day saw Simona Halep face Madison Keys on Number One court, with the former eventually coming out on top by a score of 6-7, 6-4, 6-3.(n)</desc>

Meanwhile, Yaroslava Shvedova saw her run come to an end as she fell to a 7-6, 6-2 defeat against five-time champion Venus Williams, but the Kazakh could still be proud of her performance at the tournament having progressed farther than she ever had before. Fans on Centre Court were also treated to an epic encounter in the third round of the gentlemen's doubles on the corresponding day last year, as Americans Bob and Mike Bryan were pushed all the way by the pairing of Radek Stepanek and Nenad Zimonjic, eventually prevailing 7-5, 6-7, 6-4, 3-6, 6-3.(n)</desc>

Can the Prime Minister tame the judges, the opposition, and finally the public to deliver Brexit?.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Stephen Fry narrates another documentary revealing the survival techniques of the animal kingdom's smallest creatures. This film follows a young tree shrew as it darts through the rainforest of Borneo on the lookout for food. The creature's super-fast metabolism means it is always hungry, but as it searches for fruit, it must avoid fire ants, giant snakes and even a carnivorous plant. Cameras also follow a male chipmunk collecting acorns in preparation for winter - but while he's out, a bigger, more aggressive neighbour ransacks his store. Can he get the nuts back?.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Chris Packham and a group of experts spend 12 months scrutinising the wildlife in eight gardens on a suburban street in Welwyn Garden City. Throughout the seasons they find male crickets that bribe females with food during sex, spiders that change colour to help catch prey, and ferocious life-and-death battles in the compost heap. They also shows a different side to familiar garden residents, revealing how a robin's red breast is actually war paint, and a single litter of foxes can have up to five different fathers.(n)</desc>

A DNA sample provides a link to a rebellious teenager, and the team wonders if the killer could be related to him. But a whole new can of worms is opened when investigators discover the lad's mother was raped - could the same person have killed Agnes? Gerry and Steve hope that interviewing her friends from a local chess club may shed new light on the matter, but it's a possible professional issue that could hold the key to unlocking the mystery.

    <title lang="en">Navy SEALs</title>
    <desc lang="en">This exercise in patriotic, high-tech action centers on a select group of Navy commandos and their battles against a Middle East terrorist group. This particular squadron is led by a pair of rivals: cocky, fiery Hawkins (Charlie Sheen) and stoic, unflappable Curran (Michael Biehn). When an anti-terrorist mission goes awry, allowing an enemy leader to escape with a supply of stolen American missiles, both men are certain that, given another chance, they can redeem themselves and the squad. Their rivalry plays out against a background of high-powered amphibious battles, allowing the film to revel in dangerous stunts and advanced weaponry. Joanne Whalley-Kilmer provides brief romantic relief as a journalist with important information, but the focus remains on the macho interplay between Hawkins and Curran. Co-written by former Navy Seal Chuck Pfarrer (with Gary Goldman), the film presents authentic details about the elite unit, but the bulk of Navy Seals tends to rely on familiar combat film conventions. Viewers seeking rapidly paced action sequences will not be disappointed, though other viewers may be less likely to overlook the predictable storyline and routine characters(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">In &amp; Out</title>
    <desc lang="en">Life is sweet for high-school English teacher and sports coach Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline); he's still living where he grew up, he has a good relationship with his father (Wilford Brimley) and mother (Debbie Reynolds), he's respected by his community, and he's about to marry Emily (Joan Cusack), his fiancée of three years. Fearing she was about to become an old maid, Emily has shed 75 pounds for the upcoming nuptials. But first, the entire town of Greenleaf, IN, settles in to watch the Academy Award telecast, because young stud star Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon), who attended Greenleaf High, has been nominated for an Oscar. What's more, he wins, and in his acceptance speech, singles out Howard -- and announces his favorite teacher is gay. Everyone in town is thunderstruck, including Howard himself. The media descend on the town, particularly Peter Malloy (Tom Selleck), whose job is hanging by a thread. Even worse, Howard's principal Tom Halliwell (Bob Newhart) is shaken by the news, and is toying with firing Howard. The beleaguered teacher tries to convince everyone (and himself) that he's as straight and macho as the next guy; he even tries to follow the rules on a motivational tape, "Be a Man." But his fondness for Barbra Streisand, his theatrical mannerisms, and the fact that he and Emily have yet to make love make everyone's eyebrows stay permanently raised. Meanwhile, out in Hollywood, Cameron, who's really a decent guy, learns about the problems his impulsive comment has caused, and heads back to Greenleaf to see what he can do to help. Howard's mother is fiercely determined to see at least one of her two sons wed -- Walter (Gregory Jbara), the other, is a doofus -- and as the wedding date draws nearer and nearer, poor Howard's life flies even farther out of control(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Some Kind of Wonderful</title>
    <desc lang="en">In a gender-reversed version of his previous hit Pretty in Pink, John Hughes retreads all-too- familiar ground in Some Kind of Wonderful, the story of a sensitive, young would-be artist, Keith (Eric Stoltz), who vies for the affection of his high school's popularity queen, Amanda (Lea Thompson), seemingly out of some deep-rooted insecurity regarding his social ineptitude. He enlists the help of his butch best friend and fellow misfit, Watts (Mary Stuart Masterson), unaware that she secretly pines for him. While she goads him to give up his pointless pursuit of Amanda, he encounters one other small obstacle -- Amanda's rich bully of a boyfriend, Hardy (Craig Sheffer), who threatens Keith with a face rearrangement. Undeterred, Keith decides he will, by any means necessary, escort his dream girl to the prom -- but not before he buys her expensive jewelry with the money from his college fund in order to impress her. (Hughes expects the audience to side with Keith when his father protests.) Some Kind of Wonderful is pure fantasy, but the plot is too tired and flawed for it to be completely satisfactory escapism. Still, the performances are all-around good and the ending is slightly more likeable than its predecessor's. Hughes decided to use the original Pretty in Pink ending, which had been dropped from the original after poor audience response at the advance screenings(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Two months after the events of the original Friday the 13th, Alice (Adrienne King), the lone survivor or Mrs. Vorhees' killing spree, meets a grisly end in her city apartment. Five years later, a new group of co-eds converges near Camp Crystal Lake, scene of the original massacre and the drowning of Jason Vorhees that preceded it. This time around, the horny collegians attend a nearby training school for camp counselors. As half the group parties in town, an unseen assailant picks off the other half one by one. Only when camp leader Paul (John Furey) and his girlfriend, Ginny (Amy Steel), return to camp do they uncover the identity of their stalker -- none other than Jason (Warrington Gillette) himself, alive but grotesquely deformed as a result of his childhood drowning. Flashbacks chronicle Jason's behind-the-scenes activities in the first film (perhaps explaining how his mother was able to throw the dead bodies of muscular youths through windows with such apparent ease). The young couple's only hope to defeat the fiend lies in psych major Ginny's insights in Jason's mental state(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Two siblings find themselves competing on and off the racetrack in this action-packed drama. K.C. Carlyle (Steve Howey) and his kid brother, Trip (Mike Vogel), are both racers in the rough and tumble world of supercross, a revved-up variation on motocross racing in which specially modified motorcycle negotiate specially built dirt tracks that send riders through tricky twists and turns, over rough terrain, and off high-flying jumps. Both are talented racers, but K.C. has a wilder and more reckless approach, while Trip follows a more cautious path. A more profound difference between them arises when K.C. is offered a lucrative deal to ride for a factory-sponsored team; he takes the deal, and leaves his brother behind to race on his own dime. However, when an accident takes Trip out of the running on the supercross circuit, he and K.C. set aside their differences as Trip helps coach his older brother so he can succeed in his drive to the championship. Made with the cooperation of a leading supercross race promoter, Supercross: The Movie also stars Sophia Bush and Cameron Richardson as the brothers' love interests, and Robert Carradine as a determined race coach(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The last quarter-final sees the four heat winners take on the fiendishly difficult palate test, recreating John Torode's Singapore chilli crab, having only had a couple of minutes to taste the dish and write down what they think the ingredients are. It's a tricky recipe with a fiery chilli and black-bean paste that also requires them to prepare and cook a whole crab. Can they rise to the challenge? They then rustle up a showstopping dish for the judges and food critic Kate Spicer, before finding out who has made it through to the semi-finals.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Tarts.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The 10 remaining amateur cooks' tart-making abilities are put to the test in the third round of the competition. Their first task is to bake a tarte Tatin, with judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry looking for intriguing flavour combinations to tickle their tastebuds. The hopefuls then face another daunting technical challenge as they try to replicate Mary's seemingly straightforward recipe for treacle tart, but the delicate task of adding a lattice top leaves some contestants flummoxed. Finally, they try to create an ornate fruit tart fit for gracing the window display of a leading patisserie - before discovering the identities of the latest Star Baker and the person who will be heading home. Presented by Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins. From 2012.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Lena has just moved to the small, Southern town of Gatlin, where the only person who seems to understand her -- or dream of bigger places or ideas -- is a cute guy named Ethan Wate (Alden Ehrenreich), who recognizes her instantly from the cryptic dreams he's been having every night. Lena is an orphan, and she's come to stay with her mysterious uncle, Macon Ravenwood (Irons), the patriarch of her powerful family. Powerful, because The Ravenwood clan are Casters, born with powers that ordinary mortals don't have, like the ability to move objects, control the elements, and even step out of normal space and time to communicate only with each other. But just as Lena feels ready to open up to Ethan, she discovers that their love is in imminent danger, because when female Casters turn 16, their destiny as either good or evil is revealed. Unwilling to let her nature be dictated by forces outside her control, Lena and Ethan set out together to uncover the strange, secret lore of their families' intertwined histories dating back to the Civil War, and figure out how to grant Lena the power to choose her own destiny(n)</desc>

(and better know by his mother Voletta - who co-produced the movie - as Christopher Wallace). Early on, the young Smalls shows interest in writing and performing rap with his friends, but he drifts into a life of drug dealing instead. Smalls' fortunes look to improve when a demo tape of his music is noticed by big-time producer Sean Combs (who also co-produced the movie, and is played by Derek Luke). Combs signs the rapper to his Uptown Records label, on the understanding that Smalls will forsake his narcotics activities. Director Tillman Jr goes on to track the nascent recording star's trajectory from this promising start, through his constant philandering, his love/ hate relationship with West Coast rapper Tupac Shakur and on to the bitter, ultimately homicidal, rivalry between the East and West Coast rap scenes, which was to bring to an abrupt, permanent end to both men's careers.

But the host of the show, Prem Kumar (Anil Kapoor) is convinced he's cheating and hands him over to the police to beat the truth out of him. Jamal reveals that the right answer to each question has come from a significant part of his life, from when he and his brother Salim were orphaned after their mother was killed in religious violence. As he continues his story, Jamal reveals how he knows each answer; how he fell in love with Latika, an orphaned girl from whom he was later separated; and how his brother Salim took the path of violence as a gangster's gunman. But as Jamal is returned to the studio for the last question, Salim finally repays his brother's trust. As well as the outstanding Patel, Jamal is played in different stages of his life by Tanay Hemant Gharu and Ayush Mahesh Khedekar; Salim is played by Madhur Mittal, Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala and Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail; Latika is played by Frieda Pinto, Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar and Rubina Ali, all of whom turn in stunning performances.

    <desc lang="en">A down-on-his luck auteur gets one more chance at the big time -- provided his neuroses don't swallow him whole -- in Woody Allen's 33rd feature release, Hollywood Ending. Allen plays Val Waxman, a one-time cinematic genius who's resorted to taking advertisement work to pay the bills for himself and his airhead live-in girlfriend, Lori (Debra Messing). Val finds his luck is about to change, however, when he receives the script for The City Never Sleeps, a period noir set against the backdrop of 1940s New York City. It seems his ex-wife, Ellie (Tea Leoni), now an executive at Galaxy Pictures, has been pulling for him to direct the picture, claiming he's the only man who can do justice to the script. She even manages to convince her boyfriend, Hal (Treat Williams), Galaxy's high-powered studio head, to take a chance on Val's "unique vision." Just when the cameras are ready to roll, however, Val finds that unique vision in jeopardy -- literally -- as he's struck with a psychosomatic case of blindness. When physicians and psychiatrists fail to cure him, Val contrives a scheme to forge ahead with the picture, for fear of blowing his one last chance at greatness. Hollywood Ending co-stars George Hamilton and Mark Rydell(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Fast Times at Ridgemont High</title>
    <desc lang="en">Back in the late 1970s, author Cameron Crowe banked upon his youthful appearance to pose as a teen-aged high school student. The results of his hands-on research was the revelatory book Fast Times at Ridgemont High, which went on to spectacular success as a theatrical feature. The sociological inner lining of Crowe's book was sacrificed in favor of standard teen-movie dialogue and Animal House-style comedy, but the film is impossible to dislike, and it spawned a legion of future imitators. Ostensibly, the main characters are brother and sister Jennifer Jason Leigh and Judge Reinhold. However, the real breakthrough star is Sean Penn as the perpetually zoned-out Jeff Spicoli. It is Penn who has the film's most famous scene, wherein the decorum of teacher Hand (Ray Walston)'s classroom is interrupted by a pizza delivery. Fast Times at Ridgemont High was spun off into a TV series, the short-lived 1986 weekly Fast Times(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Kirsten Sheridan's family drama stars Freddie Highmore as Evan Taylor, a musical prodigy searching for his parents. When pregnant cellist Lyla Novacek was hit by a car, her controlling father and manager told her she'd lost the baby; in reality she gave birth prematurely and her father sent the infant to an orphanage. Eleven years later, when Evan finds out that his parents are alive, he sets out to find them, taking inspiration from the music around him. The heart of the film is Evan's almost mystical ability to 'feel' music, a challenging concept that is rendered believable thanks to inventive work from the composer of the main score, Mark Mancina. Also starring Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Evan's rock singer father, and Robin Williams as a modern-day Fagin who Evan meets during his search for his family(n)</desc>

Maya Dolittle (Kyla Pratt), the youngest daughter of veterinarian John Dolittle, makes the surprising discovery that, like her dad, she can understand what animals have to say, and speak with them in their own language. Unlike her father, Maya hasn't found a suitable use for her talents, and as she finds an outlet for her unique language skills, she is sent away to Durango, a combination summer camp and dude ranch, where she strikes up a rapport with both the fellow campers and the livestock. When she learns that Durango is on the verge of going out of business due to money problems, Maya starts working with the camp's horses and cattle, giving them a much needed pep talk as they're entered in a local rodeo that could save Durango. Dr. Dolittle 3: The Daughter Is In also features Kristen Wilson, John Amos, and Walker Howard(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Rushmore</title>
    <desc lang="en">After the highly acclaimed independent film Bottle Rocket, director Wes Anderson followed up with a quirky Touchstone Studios film entitled Rushmore. Written by Anderson and friend Owen Wilson (an actor in Armageddon and Anaconda), they created the story of Max Fischer, a highly eccentric 15-year-old boy who attends the tenth grade at Rushmore Academy. Played by Jason Schwartzman (Talia Shire's son and Francis Ford Coppola's nephew), Max is a poor student with big dreams and a love of extracurricular activities. Max is editor of the school newspaper and yearbook, president of the chess, astronomy, French, and German clubs, captain of the fencing team, and director of the school play. Max is also a compulsive liar, telling everyone that his barber father (Seymour Cassel) is really a brain surgeon. Suddenly Max falls in love with Miss Cross (Olivia Williams), a first-grade teacher at the school. He also makes a new friend in business tycoon Mr. Blume (Bill Murray), an eccentric millionaire who also loves Miss Cross. The love triangle heats up as Max refuses to believe that his age has anything to do with Miss Cross refusing his romantic advances. Also Max's scheme to erect an aquarium on the school baseball diamond gets him booted out of Rushmore Academy. As his life crumbles around him, he is forced to grow up and accept the consequences of his actions and his lies. He throws himself more into his extracurricular activities, hoping to redeem himself by staging the most ambitious school play ever attempted(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Thirteen</title>
    <desc lang="en">Prolific production designer and art director Catherine Hardwicke makes her directorial debut with the coming-of-age drama Thirteen. Los Angeles teenager and overachiever Tracy (Evan Rachel Wood) is an excellent student in her seventh grade class and gets along well with her mother, Melanie (Holly Hunter). She fears that she's not cool enough to be friends with Evie (Nikki Reed), the most popular girl in school. Fueled with genuine adolescent energy, Tracy follows Evie's lead into the harsh realities of sex, drugs, and hard-edged adventure. Consumed with temptations and conflicting desires, Tracy loses her good-girl identity, greatly affecting her relationship with her mom. Partly autobiographical, Thirteen was co-written by Hardwicke and actual 13-year-old Reed, who are close family friends. Originally intending to write a teen comedy, they ended up creating a hard-hitting drama exposing the contemporary teenage experience. Thirteen was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival, with Catherine Hardwicke taking home the Director's Award(n)</desc>

Though grandma is returned unharmed, Julie asks Monk (Tony Shalhoub) to locate the old woman's abductors, promising to get him reinstated to the plice force as he does so. Monk's investigation leads him to a pair of pretentious antique dealers, Harold and Carol Maloney (Currie Graham, Eden Rountree)--but since their only likely "motive" involves a stolen cat (a fact that sets the highly allergic Monk to sneezing even before he meets the feline!), they hardly seem capable of being kidnappers or even former radicals.

As it turns out, the solution to the case appears in the unlikely form of a stray dog that Sharona (Bitty Schram) has picked up at the scene of the shooting--but simply knowing that the dog's owner and the gunman are one and the same does not mean that Monk will be able to prove it(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The broadcaster meets Florida woman Jennifer Mee who, as a teenager, became a media sensation when she suffered a particularly strange ailment - a persistent case of hiccups. But in 2010, she lured an innocent man to a dark alleyway where her friends were waiting to rob him. Instead he ended up being shot dead. Even though she didn't pull the trigger, and was nowhere near when the bullets were fired, Jennifer was sentenced to life without parole. Piers charts the journey through fame and rejection that saw Jennifer descend into a criminal lifestyle, and asks family members and legal experts if they believe her punishment was too harsh.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A clandestine love affair may claim a terrible price from two desperate people in this psychological thriller. Charles Schine (Clive Owen) is an advertising executive who is married to Deanna (Melissa George) and has a young diabetic daughter whose third kidney operation has just failed. Charles' life turns a most unexpected corner when he meets Lucinda Harris (Jennifer Aniston) on a commuter train. Lucinda, who is also married with a daughter, keeps bumping into Charles on the train, and they strike up a friendship that soon grows into something deeper. Eventually Charles and Lucinda meet for lunch, then dinner, then check into a posh hotel, but the consequences turn out to be greater than they imagined; the dangerous criminal Philippe LaRoche (Vincent Cassel) breaks into the couple's hotel room, beats Charles nearly unconscious, and rapes Lucinda. The problem doesn't end there, however; LaRoche soon unveils both his certainty that the couple avoided calling the police, and -- more troublingly -- his possession of Charles' personal information. When he makes the ill-advised attempt to blackmail the couple, Charles turns to a rough-cut friend from his workplace, who offers to help out -- for a small commission.Derailed was the first American project for Swedish filmmaker Mikael Håfström(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Hippo Has Landed. June has just begun, but the DeYoung Family Zoo, a privately owned zoo in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, is already well into its busy summer season. Bud and Carrie are always on the go and, on top of all their day-to-day chores, the zoo's largest new arrival is on its way from Jakarta, Indonesia. After an 11,000-mile journey, Wallace, a 400-pound baby hippo, is already proving to Bud and Carrie that he may be a kid, but he's calling all the shots! With a lot of coaxing and the help of some tasty carrots, the DeYoung Family Zoo finally welcomes its new hippo -- now Bud and Carrie just have to feed him! To add to the stress, Carrie has just started a no-kill animal rescue - Piper's Place - and is hoping that a fundraising event will bring in the money she needs. The balloons are up and the cake is cut, but can Carrie raise the thousands of dollars needed to keep Piper's Place afloat?(n)</desc>

The first instalment of this two-part programme looks at what drove Shipman to kill over a period of almost 30 years, examining his early school days as a model pupil up to his time as a junior doctor in Pontefract Hospital. Featuring interviews with Margaret Sivorn, who worked with him in Pontefract, and consultant forensic psychiatrist Richard Badcock, who was the only psychiatrist to assess Shipman.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The concluding edition of this two-part docu-drama looks at how Shipman covered his tracks and examines the unravelling of decades of lies that subsequently led to his conviction. In March 1998, staff at the local crematorium became suspicious of the deaths signed off by Shipman and alerted the coroner, but a police investigation was stopped after just three weeks. It was the subsequent death of Kathleen Grundy that triggered his downfall, and her daughter and son-in-law Angela and Phil Woodruff describe their reactions when they discovered that Shipman was bizarrely the sole benefactor of Kathleen's estate.(n)</desc>

A likeable young man despite his depressive disposition, Zia (Patrick Fugit) puts blade to wrist only to find that the pain of life doesn't end with the coming of death. Now trapped in a bleak metaphysical landscape populated entirely by suicide victims blearily searching for the joys that eluded them in the physical realm, Zia soon learns that the love is one of the latest arrivals in the dreary land of the dead. As Zia sets out to locate his ill-fated former companion and experience the joys that eluded the couple in life, he is joined in his quest by a lovelorn Russian rocker named Eugene (Shea Wigham) and an accidental tourist named Mikal (Shannyn Sossamon), who's looking for a way out of the sorrowful stir(n)</desc>

The glimmer of a better life always just out of reach, Russell Baze (Christian Bale) dreams of starting a family with his girlfriend Lena (Zoe Saldana), and resolves to earn an honest living working in the same mill where his dying father did. Meanwhile, Russell's volatile younger brother Rodney (Casey Affleck) decides to serve his country by fighting in Iraq. Despite Russell's best intentions, however, his future starts to look grim when he is sent to prison following a deadly drunk-driving accident; at the same time, Rodney begins competing in illegal fights for local bar owner John Petty (Willem Dafoe), who owes a sizable debt to the very dangerous Harlan DeGroat (Woody Harrelson), a fight organizer/meth dealer who's way too into his own product. Later, after Russell is released from prison having missed his father's funeral, he is heartbroken to learn that Lena has become seriously involved with the local police chief, Wesley Barnes (Forest Whitaker). But heartache turns to anger when the desperate Rodney also gets mixed up with DeGroat, and winds up dead along with John Petty. Informed by Chief Barnes that Rodney's body has been found by a hunter, Russell, believing he has nothing to lose, recruits his loyal uncle Red (Sam Shepard) to help him seek revenge(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Captivity</title>
    <desc lang="en">Vatel director Roland Joffé teams with screenwriters Larry Cohen and Joseph Tura to adapt an original story by Cohen concerning a fashion model (Elisha Cuthbert) and her chauffeur, who are kidnapped and held captive by a sadistic serial killer. Jennifer Tree (Cuthbert) is America's sweetheart; a top fashion model and ubiquitous cover girl who is adored by millions, Jennifer possesses all of the wealth and power that comes with being a natural, world-class beauty. Every girl wants to be Jennifer, and every man wants to have her -- one more than all others combined. That man has been lying in wait for precisely the right moment to strike, and when Jennifer makes the fateful mistake of stepping out on her own at a Soho charity event, he finally sees the opportunity to take possession of his most prized object. Drugged, taken, and placed in a cell, where she is forced to endure unspeakable mental and physical torture, Jennifer struggles against her twisted tormentor with every ounce of courage and fight that she has -- but will it be enough for her to endure should her captor continue to maintain the upper hand? A controversial film long before it ever went into wide release, Captivity caused quite a stir when graphic, unapproved ads for the film appeared on billboards and taxicabs in New York and Los Angeles. Though representatives from Captivity's releasing company After Dark Films claimed that the wrong materials were shipped to the printers and put up before they realized what had happened, public outcry was such that the MPAA saw fit to suspend the ratings process for the film. As a result, it quickly became apparent that Captivity would fail to procure an MPAA rating before its original target release date(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">I Love You Phillip Morris</title>
    <desc lang="en">Jim Carrey and Ewan McGregor star in this comedy from Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (creators of Bad Santa). Steven Russell is seemingly the ultimate wholesome family man: he plays the organ at church, celebrates good news with a nice glass of healthy milk and prays nightly beside his blonde, blue-eyed wife. But a car accident provokes him to reassess his life; he admits that he is gay, and enthusiastically embraces the epitome of what he imagines a gay lifestyle to be. But his new lifestyle is expensive and he ends up in jail for fraud. There he meets the sensitive Phillip Morris, who he's determined to free from prison - through a series of inventive cons - so that they can secure a future together. McGregor provides the heart of the film, while Carrey turns in a compelling and poignant performance. It's perhaps surprising that this funny and original film is based on a true story. Ficarra and Requa have been in a relationship for more than 20 years, which could explain why the comedy feels more about a man in love, rather than a tale revolving entirely around his sexuality(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The combination of romance and zombies comedy seems unfeasible... unless it falls into the hands of the brilliant Edgar Wright, co-creator with Simon Pegg (scriptwriter of Zombies Party) of the Spaced series, a milestone in recent British television. In this macabre story, Shaun (Simon Pegg) is down in the dumps, going through an unstoppable crisis in his life. About to turn 30, he passes the time in The Winchester bar, dislikes his job, argues with his mother every day, and the relationship with his girlfriend, Liz (Kate Ashfield), worsens by the hour. When she finally leaves him, Shaun decides, once and for all, to do something about his life. His first step is not visiting a psychologist, but confronting an invasion of living dead with just two weapons: a cricket bat and a shovel! Zombies Party is -at the same time- a parody and a tribute to zombie films(n)</desc>

Filmmaker Stephen Walker spent several weeks with the members of the Young@Heart Chorus as they rehearsed for their annual concert in Northampton, and Young@Heart is a documentary which offers a look at their rigorous rehearsal process, the background of several members, and their efforts to stay active and think positive, even as their friends succumb to old age. Produced for British television, Young@Heart was screened in competition at the 2007 Los Angeles Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Private Lives of Pippa Lee</title>
    <desc lang="en">Rebecca Miller (The Ballad of Jack &amp; Rose) adapts her own novel with this comedy drama about a woman who begins a second life after her husband leaves her for a younger woman. Pippa Lee (Robin Wright) is the loving mother of two grown children, and the wife of successful publisher Herb (Alan Arkin). Despite the fact that she's 30 years Herb's junior, Pippa and her husband have never fallen short on things to talk about. She's always enjoyed the hustle and bustle of New York, but after Herb suffers a serious heart attack, Pippa dutifully moves with him to a quaint suburban home in small-town Connecticut. And for a while, at least, she coasts -- enjoying frequent dinner parties with her new friends Sam (Mike Binder) and Sandra (Winona Ryder), and spending quiet nights caring for Herb, who has lately grown increasingly distant. That all starts to change when Chris (Keanu Reeves) comes back to town following a bitter divorce. Gradually, Pippa's suppressed resentments begin bubbling to the surface, highlighting the conflict between the free-spirited girl she used to be and the frustrated woman who has taken her place. Somewhere along the line, Pippa lost track of her own identity. But Pippa's remarkable journey of self-discovery is just beginning. Julianne Moore, Monica Bellucci, Maria Bello, and Blake Lively co-star in a Plan B Entertainment production(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A handful of inner-city kids move up to the big time in this teen-centric musical. Xavier Smith (Bow Wow), known to his friends as X, is a teenager growing up on the South Side of Chicago in the late '70s. X and his buddies are the hotshot skaters at the Palisades Gardens, a neighborhood roller rink where local kids roll to the latest disco sounds, but X loses his status as king of the hill when the Palisades closes down. With no skating action close by, X and his friends head uptown to the Sweetwater Roller Rink, where they feel like country mice in the big city among the expert skate dancers and beautiful women. But skating means a lot to X -- with his widower father, Curtis (Chi McBride) going through a bad patch, skating gives him a sense of accomplishment and a belief in his own talent. So X and company keep heading uptown to Sweetwater, where they prepare to take on Sweetness (Wesley Jonathan) and his crew of the rink's best dancers for the upcoming Roller Jam Skate-Off. X befriends a young local girl named Tori (Jurnee Smolett) and finds a good reason to go uptown when he meets a pretty skater girl, Naomi (Meagan Good). Meanwhile, Tori's mother, Vivian (Kellita Smith) takes an interest in Curtis. Featuring a score of classic '70s R&amp;B and disco, Roll Bounce was directed by Malcolm D.

    <title lang="en">Biggie and Tupac</title>
    <desc lang="en">Nick Broomfield, director of Heidi Fleiss: Hollywood Madam and Kurt and Courtney, unleashes another provocation with Biggie and Tupac. Considering Broomfield's track record, that the film is dangerous, sensational, and occasionally very funny is no surprise. What is somewhat shocking, in a very rewarding and commendable way, is how moving Biggie and Tupac is. Using archival footage of the two rap stars and interviews with many of those involved, Broomfield uncovers significant evidence that corrupt LAPD cops were involved in the two deaths, and that the FBI was doing surveillance on Biggie (Christopher Wallace) on the night he was murdered. Broomfield's film also strongly suggests that Death Row Records head Suge Knight orchestrated both murders. Few satisfactory conclusions are drawn, but the film should at least encourage further investigation of these claims. By running the camera constantly, even before the interviews begin, Broomfield frequently catches his subjects off guard. But even if Broomfield had uncovered nothing, Biggie and Tupac would still be an entertaining and valuable telling of the tragic deaths of two talented young men. The filmmaker's interviews with Biggie's friends, and particularly his charming mother, Voletta Wallace, paint a picture of a surprisingly sensitive and goodhearted young man. Broomfield was granted less access to Tupac Shakur's family (Tupac's mother is still involved in business dealings with Knight; she doesn't appear in the film and she refused Broomfield permission to use Tupac's music), but he still manages to expose the controversial rapper's essential humanity. Some will find Broomfield's sarcastic and edgy attitude grating. He doesn't have the puppy-dog charm of a Michael Moore. But with Biggie and Tupac, he's shown a bit more of his sensitive side, and he's taken a step forward as a filmmaker(n)</desc>

Eventually, luck runs out when they are caught in a police sting; one boy is shot to death by the crooked Officer Roscoe (Saul Stein), who then warns Jason not to tell a soul; however, they continue stealing cars. Meanwhile, Jason beats up a neighborhood acquaintance on the playground for a slight to his sister and finds himself the target of the boy's murder attempts.

    <title lang="en">Django Unchained</title>
    <desc lang="en">A former slave and a German bounty hunter become unlikely allies in the battle against a tyrannical plantation owner in this western from visionary director Quentin Tarantino. Two years before the Civil War pits brother-against-brother, German-born fugitive hunter Dr. King Schultz (Academy Award-winner Christoph Waltz) arrives in America determined to capture the outlaw Brittle brothers dead or alive. In the midst of his search, Dr. Schultz crosses paths with Django (Academy Award-winner Jamie Foxx), a freed slave and skilled tracker who seeks to rescue his beloved wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from ruthless plantation owner Calvin Candie (Academy Award-nominee Leonardo DiCaprio). Once Django has aided Dr. Schultz in coralling the Brittle brothers, the two team up to capture some of the most wanted men in the South. Meanwhile, Django never loses sight of his mission to free Broomhilda from the treacherous slave trade before it's too late. Upon arriving at Candie's nefarious plantation, dubbed Candyland, Django and Dr. Schultz discover that slaves are being groomed for gladiator-like competitions by Candie's malevolent right-hand man Billy Crash (Walton Goggins), and together they skillfully work their way onto the compound for a closer look. But just as Django and his partner locate Broomhilda and plot a daring escape, Candie's house slave Stephen (Academy Award-nominee Samuel L. Jackson) catches wind of their plan, and informs his master of the betrayal. Now, as a clandestine organization attempts to back them into a corner, Django and Dr. Schultz will have to come out with pistols blazing if they ever hope to free Broomhilda from Candyland and the clutches of its vile proprietor(n)</desc>
