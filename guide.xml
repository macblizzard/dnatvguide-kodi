    <title lang="en">The Nightmare Neighbour Next Door</title>
    <desc lang="en">The documentary focuses on two residential disputes that escalated from complaints about noise-making to far more serious quarrels. Warren and Sharee detail how their peaceful lives in a quiet Birmingham suburb were ruined when new neighbour Harry moved in. Harry complained of noise the pair knew wasn't coming from their household, an accusation he would level more than once, and with increasing intensity. Finally, when the hostile Harry pulled out a gun and threatened the couple over their garden fence, they were forced to sell up and move out. However, even after relocating, it seemed their nightmare was not over. Also featured is the story of Jill, who was just a teenager when Barry, who lived with his parents next-door, became fixated on her family making a racket. Brushing off the grievance, Jill and her relatives tried to get on with their lives, but one autumn day the feud took a tragic, life-changing turn.(n)</desc>

Juno (Ellen Page) may seem wise beyond her years, but after sleeping with classmate Bleeker (Michael Cera), the pregnant teen quickly realizes how little she really knows about life. Thankfully, Juno has been blessed with parents (J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney) who trust their daughter's judgment, and a best friend named Leah (Olivia Thirlby), who's always willing to help out in a pinch. With a little help from Leah, Juno soon comes into contact with Mark (Jason Bateman) and Vanessa (Jennifer Garner) -- an affluent suburban couple who have been unable to conceive a child of their own. Mark and Vanessa seem like they would make great parents, and are eager to adopt Juno's unborn child. Now, as adolescent Juno is faced with a series of very adult decisions, she will draw on the support of her family and friends in order to discover who she truly is, and discover that one bad choice can have a lifetime of consequences(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">American Pie</title>
    <desc lang="en">It's said that most American men think about sex once every two or three minutes, but this statistic would seriously underestimate the horniness of Jim (Jason Biggs), a high school senior in suburban Michigan. Jim is thoroughly obsessed with sex, a fact of which his parents become aware when they discover him performing the sin of Onan with a gym sock while watching scrambled pay-per-view porn. Jim's buddies Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), and Oz (Chris Klein) are no less anxious to relieve themselves of their virginity, so they all make a pledge: they will go to bed with a woman in the three weeks before senior prom or die trying. Kevin appears to have the advantage, since he already has a girlfriend, Vicky (Tara Reid), but before he ventures into the Final Frontier, Kevin is urged to consult "The Bible," a hand-written how-to manual possessing erotic wisdom passed down through the ages. Oz is a good-looking jock who is actually a nice guy -- which is part of the problem, since he has his heart set on a nice girl, Heather (Mena Suvari), who does not seem the type to leap into bed within 21 days. Finch has no immediate prospects, though Jessica (Natasha Lyonne) is in a position to know if those rumors about him are true. And Jim is a truly hopeless case -- after his attempted seduction of beautiful Czech exchange student Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) turns out to be a disaster, he ends up going to the prom with Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), an annoyingly chatty band geek who does, however, have a fascinating story about a flute. American Pie was the directorial debut of Paul Weitz, who, along with his brother Chris Weitz (who served as producer), previously wrote several screenplays, including Antz and Madeline (where they presumably worked all their wholesome ideas out of their system)(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Rails &amp; Ties</title>
    <desc lang="en">Kevin Bacon, Marcia Gay Harden, and Miles Heizer star in director Alison Eastwood's tale of two families locked into an emotional -- and physical -- collision course. There once was a time when Tom and Megan Stark had all the time in the world to take their dream vacation and start a family, but these days the couple's marriage is suffering and their time appears to be running short. Megan has been diagnosed with a potentially terminal illness, and when the prospect of losing his wife becomes too much to bear, railroad engineer Tom seeks escape in his work. On the tracks Tom is in control; all the routes are predetermined and he knows he'll eventually arrive at his destination. But sometimes even the most predictable events can go suddenly awry, and when Tom's train hits a car that was parked on the tracks by a suicidal mother, his life is plunged into ruin. While there was no way that Tom could have possibly stopped the train on time, the grieving conductor's woes are suddenly compounded upon realizing that he may lose his job because of the accident. Not only that, but the deceased woman's son, Davey, is consumed by the guilt that he could do nothing to prevent the accident, and he now places the blame for his mother's death squarely on Tom. But not all sad stories have to end in tragedy, and perhaps in the aftermath of this fateful accident Megan could receive a second chance at fulfilling her dreams, Tom could learn to open his heart before he is consumed by bitterness, and Davey could finally learn the true meaning of family(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Three teenagers two-timed by a local lothario decide to turn the tables on him in this romantic comedy. John Tucker (Jesse Metcalfe) is the big man on campus at his high school -- he's the captain and star player of the basketball team, he's got money, he's good-looking and charming, and he can have any girl he wants. However, the latter attribute is about to get him in serious trouble when three different girls at his school -- Heather (Ashanti), Beth (Sophia Bush) and Carrie (Arielle Kebbel) -- discover they've all been dating John at the same time. Determined to bring down the campus ladykiller, the girls devise a plan -- they pick a cute but socially clumsy girl who is new at school, Kate (Brittany Snow), and give her a crash course in stealing John's heart. Once Kate has John wrapped around her little finger, she's supposed to drop him like a bad habit and give him a taste of what heartbreak is really like. However, it seems that the early stages of the plan work a little too well, and John and Kate end up falling for each other for real. John Tucker Must Die also stars Jenny McCarthy, Penn Badgley, and Dan Payne(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This weekly, syndicated children's reality show was packaged by Steve Rotfeld Productions, the same firm responsible for such similar FCC-friendly efforts as Awesome Adventures and Wild About Animals. Hosted by Christine Long, the series used actual footage and re-enactments to show its target audience (kids aged 13 to 16) how to confront and cope with extraordinary situations, many of them dangerous in nature. Typical episodes demonstrated CPR techniques, the extinguishing of household fires, and the handling of moral dilemmas. Also offered were tips on building, cooking and general housekeeping, with added input from experts in these fields. Offering three to four "features" per half hour episode, WHADDAYDO? was first distributed by TVI Media beginning the week of September 12, 2005(n)</desc>

In the not-too-distant future, our planet has come under attack from a malevolent race of aliens known as the Formics. Incredibly, fearless International Fleet Commander Mazer Rackham (Ben Kingsley) sent them fleeing back into the stars, becoming a living legend in the process. But decorated Colonel Hyrum Graff (Harrison Ford) knows that the Formics will soon return even stronger than they were before, and he's determined to find a new hero who can meet them head on. Enter Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield), a modest young man with vast untapped potential. Upon being recruited into Battle School, Ender partakes in a grueling series of simulations, effortlessly mastering every challenge presented to him. Celebrated by his peers and respected by his superiors, Ender is quickly promoted to Command School, where the one and only Mazer Rackham provides him with the knowledge and tools needed to save mankind from certain extinction. As the final battle approaches, Ender prepares to embrace his destiny as one of the greatest heroes in the history of planet Earth(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</title>
    <desc lang="en">Douglas Adams' oft-adapted tale of an normal guy making his way through the universe (it's already been presented as a novel, a radio serial, a television series, and a comic book) finally makes its way to the big screen in this endearingly goofy sci-fi comedy. Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman) is a very ordinary man who is having a truly unusual day -- after discovering that one of his best friends, Ford Prefect (Mos Def), is actually an alien, Ford tells him that the planet Earth is going to be destroyed so that otherworldly forces can make room for construction of a hyperspace bypass. Since Arthur accidentally saved Ford's life years ago, Ford does him a favor -- he first gets him a ride on a spaceship passing by, and then presents him with a guidebook that will tell a beginner everything he needs to know as he hitchhikes through outer space. Along the way, Arthur encounters such interstellar notables as sleazy Galaxy president Zaphod Beebelbrox (Sam Rockwell), the girl of his dreams Tricia McMillan (Zooey Deschanel), perpetually glum robot Marvin (voice of Alan Rickman), interplanetary construction magnate Slartibartfast (Bill Nighy), and cult leader Humma Kavula (John Malkovich). The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was the first feature film for Garth Jennings, previously best known for his work in television commercials and music videos; he was recommended to the producers by director Spike Jonze after Jonze had to turn down an offer to head up the project(n)</desc>

In each market that the series played, viewers were invited to send in video clips of "crazy stuff never seen on TV" -- especially if "hot girls" were involved (that's what it said on the press release!). Seen on the NBC-owned stations in the larger markets, Whacked Out Sports was initially broadcast on September 7, 2006(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This is the inside story of Street Art: a brutal and revealing account of what happens when fame, money and vandalism collide. Oscar-nominated Exit Through the Gift Shop follows an eccentric shop-keeper turned amateur filmmaker as he attempts to capture many of the world's most infamous vandals on camera, only to have a British stencil artist named Banksy turn the camcorder back on its owner with wildly unexpected results. One of the most provocative films about art ever made, Exit Through the Gift Shop is a fascinating study of low-level criminality, comradeship and incompetence. By turns shocking, hilarious and absurd, this is an enthralling modern-day fairytale... with bolt cutters(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Capote</title>
    <desc lang="en">The creation of one of the most memorable books of the 1960s -- and the impact the writing and research would have on its author -- is explored in this drama based on a true story. In 1959, Truman Capote (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman) was a critically acclaimed novelist who had earned a small degree of celebrity for his work when he read a short newspaper item about a multiple murder in a small Kansas town. For some reason, the story fascinated Capote, and he asked William Shawn (Bob Balaban), his editor at The New Yorker, to let him write a piece about the case. Capote had long believed that in the right hands, a true story could be molded into a tale as compelling as any fiction, and he believed this event, in which the brutal and unimaginable was visited upon a community where it was least expected, could be just the right material. Capote traveled to Kansas with his close friend Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), herself becoming a major literary figure with the success of To Kill a Mockingbird, and while Capote's effete and mannered personal style stuck out like a sore thumb in Kansas, in time he gained the trust of Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper), the Kansas Bureau of Investigation agent investigating the murder of the Clutter family, and with his help Capote's magazine piece grew into a full-length book. Capote also became familiar with the petty criminals who killed the Clutter family, Dick Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) and Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.), and in Smith he found a troubling kindred spirit more like himself than he wanted to admit. After attaining a sort of friendship with Smith under the assumption that the man would be executed before the book was ever published, Capote finds himself forced to directly confront the moral implications of his actions with regards to both his role in the man's death, and the way that he would be remembered. Capote also co-stars Bruce Greenwood as Capote's longtime companion Jack Dunphy, and Amy Ryan as Mary Dewey, Alvin's wife who became a confidante of Capote's(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Capote</title>
    <desc lang="en">The creation of one of the most memorable books of the 1960s -- and the impact the writing and research would have on its author -- is explored in this drama based on a true story. In 1959, Truman Capote (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman) was a critically acclaimed novelist who had earned a small degree of celebrity for his work when he read a short newspaper item about a multiple murder in a small Kansas town. For some reason, the story fascinated Capote, and he asked William Shawn (Bob Balaban), his editor at The New Yorker, to let him write a piece about the case. Capote had long believed that in the right hands, a true story could be molded into a tale as compelling as any fiction, and he believed this event, in which the brutal and unimaginable was visited upon a community where it was least expected, could be just the right material. Capote traveled to Kansas with his close friend Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), herself becoming a major literary figure with the success of To Kill a Mockingbird, and while Capote's effete and mannered personal style stuck out like a sore thumb in Kansas, in time he gained the trust of Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper), the Kansas Bureau of Investigation agent investigating the murder of the Clutter family, and with his help Capote's magazine piece grew into a full-length book. Capote also became familiar with the petty criminals who killed the Clutter family, Dick Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) and Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.), and in Smith he found a troubling kindred spirit more like himself than he wanted to admit. After attaining a sort of friendship with Smith under the assumption that the man would be executed before the book was ever published, Capote finds himself forced to directly confront the moral implications of his actions with regards to both his role in the man's death, and the way that he would be remembered. Capote also co-stars Bruce Greenwood as Capote's longtime companion Jack Dunphy, and Amy Ryan as Mary Dewey, Alvin's wife who became a confidante of Capote's(n)</desc>

Newcomer Reece Thompson plays Hal Hefner, a 15-year-old high-school student with a minor yet socially alienating (and painful) disability: he stutters uncontrollably. Determined to work through the problem, Hal opts for an extreme route -- he joins the school debating team, which sends him on a headfirst plunge into breakneck speech competitions -- and offers a much-needed boost toward correcting the problem. Blitz, like his onscreen alter ego, struggled with a stammer as a young man -- a disability he eventually surmounted -- which imparted him with a lifelong interest in speech and storytelling(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In Kirk demicco's animated film three supersonic simian spacemen take to the cosmos to find a missing probe, and encounter a whole world of trouble along the way. Ham III, grandson of the first chimp in space, is a wise-cracking smart aleck who makes a living being fired from a cannon. When the Infinity Space Probe goes missing, Ham joins a mission to find it. Although he has been recruited as a PR stunt, his fellow Space Chimps are highly trained experts Luna and Titan. When the three crash-land on the planet Malgor, they find a race of aliens who are being oppressed by the tyrannical Zartog, who is using the probe for his own nefarious ends. It falls to the feckless Ham to save the day, using his circus skills to help liberate the aliens, recover the probe, get the girl, and secure passage home. This is great fare for all the family, with plenty of deadpan asides to keep grown-ups entertained. The cast also includes Stanley Tucci, and two names Glee devotees will recognise Jane Lynch and Kristin Chenoweth(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Ella Enchanted</title>
    <desc lang="en">Adapted from author Gail Carson Levine's award-winning children's book of the same name, the Miramax-financed modern fantasy Ella Enchanted is directed by Tommy O'Haver and stars The Princess Diaries alumna Anne Hathaway. Ella (Hathaway) lives in a magical world in which each child, at the moment of their birth, is given a virtuous "gift" from a fairy godmother. Ella's so-called gift, however, is obedience. This birthright proves itself to be quite the curse once Ella finds herself in the hands of several unscrupulous characters whom she quite literally cannot disobey. Determined to gain control of her life and decisions, Ella sets off on a journey she hopes will end with the lifting of the curse in question. The path, however, isn't easy -- Ella must outwit a slew of unpleasant magical creatures ranging from ogres to talking books with evil plots. Though perilous, Ella's adventures turn out to be necessary obstacles in the path toward finding herself, and maybe even true love along the way. Ella Enchanted also features Cary Elwes, who has starred in a fantasy feature himself (the widely acclaimed The Princess Bride), Hugh Dancy, and Patrick Bergin, among others(n)</desc>

Carlito renounces his previous ways and takes a job as the manager of a club that Kleinfeld has invested in, planning to save enough money so that he can eventually move to the Caribbean. But no sooner is Carlito back on the streets of New York than his old life claws at him in the form of both old partners (Luis Guzman) and vicious up-and-comers (John Leguizamo). Nevertheless, Carlito stays clean and even restarts his relationship with a dancer named Gail (Penelope Ann Miller), until he is finally led astray by Kleinfeld, who manipulates Carlito into participating in the murder of a Mafia don from whom Kleinfeld has stolen a million dollars. At that point, the race is on to see whether Carlito and Gail can escape his world for good. The film is based on two novels about Carlito written by New York State judge Edwin Torres(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Heartbreakers</title>
    <desc lang="en">After the little white lies of Romy and Michele's High School Reunion (1997), director David Mirkin focuses on scheming of a different sort in Heartbreakers. Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt play Max and Page Conners, a mother and daughter who share everything with each other: relationship advice, hair and makeup hints, and the money they win in costly divorce settlements with rich men. When the film opens, the Conners are putting the finishing touches on conning Dean (Ray Liotta), an auto-body shop owner. When the dust from that scam clears, Page announces she's ready to move away from her mother and set up shop on her own -- but in order to clear an outstanding debt, Max insists they bankrupt one more bachelor together. They settle upon phlegmatic Palm Springs widower William B. Tensy (Gene Hackman), a chain smoker with a heart of gold and a similarly bountiful bank account. Only two things stand in their way: Tensy's Teutonic caretaker Miss Madress (Nora Dunn) and beachfront bartender Jack (Jason Lee), a wry stargazer with whom Page becomes unexpectedly smitten. Heartbreakers is the third collaboration from writers Steven Mazur and Paul Guy, whose previous screwball comedy was 1997's international hit, Liar Liar(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Marcus Nispel seems to have a bit of thing for remakes, having remoulded The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in 2003, as well as Conan the Barbarian this year. However, in this slasher horror, Nispel compresses elements of the first four films in the Friday the 13th franchise, which started way back in 1980, into one blood-sodden whole. This retread gives some background as to why Jason Voorhees (Derek Mears) became such a relentlessly homicidal maniac, before getting on with the business of steel on flesh and bucketloads of gore, delivering the movie's raison d'être. Some weeks after his sister goes missing, Clay Miller's (Jared Padalecki) search for his sibling leads him to Crystal Lake, a remote, wooded campsite. Also arriving at the spot is a group of young revellers, intent on partying. But it's not long before the man with the hockey mask and machete pays them a visit that any survivors are unlikely to forget. Can any of them escape Voorhees' latest murderous rampage? Or will they all vanish like Clay's sister and her friends? Network premiere. M,W,S,HD(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Hunt for Red October</title>
    <desc lang="en">The first of several films based on Tom Clancy's "Jack Ryan" technothrillers, Hunt for Red October stars Alec Baldwin as eccentric CIA analyst Ryan and Sean Connery as Soviet submarine commander Marko Ramius. Ramius sets the plot in motion when he murders his political adviser, burns his orders, and steers his sub Red October towards American waters, hoping to defect. The CIA, aware that the Red October was about to embark on an evasive mission to demonstrate its ability to avoid detection and fire its nuclear missiles upon U.S. installations, believes that Ramius is insane, and that he plans to start World War III. To cover their own behinds, the Russians back up the CIA's suspicion. Only Jack Ryan believes that Ramius' mission is not as apocalyptic as it seems -- and it is Ryan who is assigned to infiltrate the Red October to prove his theory. The sort of film that in an earlier era would have been called a "thinking man's thriller," The Hunt for Red October ushered in a new series of Hollywood-produced post-Cold War adventure films, including 1995's Crimson Tide(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Will Forte, Kristen Wiig and Val Kilmer star in this violent, risqué action-movie spoof. It's an extended spin-off of a regular Saturday Night Live sketch that in turn pastiches the 80s TV action series MacGyver. Our bumbling 'hero' is the bemulleted former special ops agent MacGruber, who has a sartorial taste all of his own (thankfully) and a general aversion to using weapons (though this doesn't extend to his allies). Having to all purposes retired, he's dragged unwillingly from seclusion to thwart the dastardly Dieter von Cunth - a terrorist who has recently got his hands on a nuclear missile. But saving the world isn't MacGruber's main reason for taking on the mission: he has unfinished business with von Cunth, who was responsible for the death of his girlfriend; and he's also keen to work again with the foxy Vicki St Elmo(n)</desc>

The remains have been identified as dating back to Roman times, but it has yet to be determined who these people were and how their heads ended up buried on the site. Archaeologists examine the bones for evidence of the various theories that have been suggested, questioning whether the skulls belonged to gladiators, executed rebels or the victims of a massacre, or formed part of a grisly ritual.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">For two years, a monster crocodile terrorizes a small Filipino community. It starts in 2009, with an attack on two young school girls - in which the crocodile decapitates 11-year-old Rowena Ruiz. More attacks on fishermen and livestock follow until September 2011, when Filipino croc legend Ronnie Sumiller succeeds in catching the killer alive. Called Lolong, the beast that they pull from the swamp is more massive than anything they've ever seen. Crocodile biologist Adam Britton arrives to measure it and officially certifies it as the Guinness Book of Records' largest known crocodile in the world. But there is dissent among the villagers - they're certain Lolong is the wrong croc, and that an even bigger monster is still out there(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Top Gear</title>
    <desc lang="en">Richard Hammond gets behind the wheel of the mid-engined Alfa Romeo 4C on the shores of Lake Como in Italy - but his enjoyment of the lightweight vehicle is disturbed by the arrival of Jeremy Clarkson, who demands a race against his quad bike. Jeremy also visits Belgium, putting the McLaren P1 hypercar to the test in Bruges and around the Spa-Francorchamps Formula One circuit - and its combined power output of more than 900bhp generated from electricity and turbocharged petrol V8 power is likely to cause astonishment. Meanwhile, James May spends time at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan to learn about the army's vehicle redeployment efforts, and Thor star Tom Hiddleston tries to coax the best time he can muster from the Reasonably Priced Car.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Zen, or the Skill to Catch a Killer. This second episode of the first season of Twin Peaks, the genre-twisting, quirky television serial from director David Lynch and co-creator Mark Frost, follows Agent Dale Cooper as he and Sheriff Harry Truman continue their investigation into the murder of homecoming queen Laura Palmer. Cooper turns to non-traditional methods of criminology, lecturing the local law on the wisdom of Tibet and using a rock-throwing technique to narrow down the list of suspects. Meanwhile, several important plot threads are revealed in this installment, including the involvement of hotel-owner Jerry Horne with One-Eyed Jack's, a local brothel, the extent of the local drug trade, and financial misdeed at the saw mill. Amongst Laura's friends and family, a new, uneasy friendship forms between Audrey Horne and Donna Hayward, while the Palmer household continues to mourn, seeming to approach psychological instability. This episode, directed by Lynch himself, was the most discussed episode of the series, largely thanks to its surrealistic conclusion -- a dream sequence where Agent Cooper, in a strange red-curtained room, encounters such figures as the One-Armed Man, the Magician, the dancing Man From Another Place, and Laura Palmer herself, who reveals the name of her killer(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Realization Time. Twin Peaks, Vol. 6 is the sixth regular-season episode of Twin Peaks, the famed, short-lived television serial from David Lynch and Mark Frost. This volume centers around the undercover infiltration of One-Eyed Jack's, another step in the investigation of Laura Palmer's murder. Agent Dale Cooper, Sheriff Harry Truman and Big Ed Hurley all explore the casino and brothel, posing as oral surgeons. Audrey Horne has also been working been her way into One-Eyed Jack's -- posing not as a customer, but as a potential employee, recruited in the same manner as Laura Palmer. Audrey winds up there on the same night as does central suspect Jacques Renault. Meanwhile, James Hurley and Donna Hayward, suspicious of Dr. Jacoby, lay a trap for him by disguising Laura's cousin Madeline as Laura, back from the dead. This installment, directed by famed cinematographer Caleb Deschanel, contains some of the most memorable moments of the series, which is characterized by bizarre comedy and surreal details within an atmosphere of brooding mystery. Especially notable scenes are Audrey's "audition" for Blackie, where she ties a cherry stem in a knot with her tongue, and the ultimate fate of Waldo the mynah bird(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Hurt Locker</title>
    <desc lang="en">Kathryn Bigelow's multiple-Oscar-winning film is a compelling fact-based, Iraq-set bomb disposal drama, scripted by journalist Mark Boal, drawing on his experiences while embedded with a United States Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal team in 2004. The focus is on the complex characters making up Bravo Company, who disable and destroy improvised explosive devices. The days are ticking down to the end of the bomb squad's tour, but their role puts the team in harm's way around the clock. And it doesn't help that one of the team is addicted to risk taking and pays scant attention to standard procedure, putting other lives in danger, as well as his own. The Hurt Locker provides a tense glimpse into the lives of these extraordinary men, and also probes the various psychologies of people whose job could kill them at any moment, as well as - briefly - exploring how they cope once away from their adrenaline-soaked vocation. Also starring Anthony Mackie, Ralph Fiennes, Guy Pearce, Brian Geraghty and Evangeline Lilly(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Zen, or the Skill to Catch a Killer. This second episode of the first season of Twin Peaks, the genre-twisting, quirky television serial from director David Lynch and co-creator Mark Frost, follows Agent Dale Cooper as he and Sheriff Harry Truman continue their investigation into the murder of homecoming queen Laura Palmer. Cooper turns to non-traditional methods of criminology, lecturing the local law on the wisdom of Tibet and using a rock-throwing technique to narrow down the list of suspects. Meanwhile, several important plot threads are revealed in this installment, including the involvement of hotel-owner Jerry Horne with One-Eyed Jack's, a local brothel, the extent of the local drug trade, and financial misdeed at the saw mill. Amongst Laura's friends and family, a new, uneasy friendship forms between Audrey Horne and Donna Hayward, while the Palmer household continues to mourn, seeming to approach psychological instability. This episode, directed by Lynch himself, was the most discussed episode of the series, largely thanks to its surrealistic conclusion -- a dream sequence where Agent Cooper, in a strange red-curtained room, encounters such figures as the One-Armed Man, the Magician, the dancing Man From Another Place, and Laura Palmer herself, who reveals the name of her killer(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Realization Time. Twin Peaks, Vol. 6 is the sixth regular-season episode of Twin Peaks, the famed, short-lived television serial from David Lynch and Mark Frost. This volume centers around the undercover infiltration of One-Eyed Jack's, another step in the investigation of Laura Palmer's murder. Agent Dale Cooper, Sheriff Harry Truman and Big Ed Hurley all explore the casino and brothel, posing as oral surgeons. Audrey Horne has also been working been her way into One-Eyed Jack's -- posing not as a customer, but as a potential employee, recruited in the same manner as Laura Palmer. Audrey winds up there on the same night as does central suspect Jacques Renault. Meanwhile, James Hurley and Donna Hayward, suspicious of Dr. Jacoby, lay a trap for him by disguising Laura's cousin Madeline as Laura, back from the dead. This installment, directed by famed cinematographer Caleb Deschanel, contains some of the most memorable moments of the series, which is characterized by bizarre comedy and surreal details within an atmosphere of brooding mystery. Especially notable scenes are Audrey's "audition" for Blackie, where she ties a cherry stem in a knot with her tongue, and the ultimate fate of Waldo the mynah bird(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Hurt Locker</title>
    <desc lang="en">Kathryn Bigelow's multiple-Oscar-winning film is a compelling fact-based, Iraq-set bomb disposal drama, scripted by journalist Mark Boal, drawing on his experiences while embedded with a United States Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal team in 2004. The focus is on the complex characters making up Bravo Company, who disable and destroy improvised explosive devices. The days are ticking down to the end of the bomb squad's tour, but their role puts the team in harm's way around the clock. And it doesn't help that one of the team is addicted to risk taking and pays scant attention to standard procedure, putting other lives in danger, as well as his own. The Hurt Locker provides a tense glimpse into the lives of these extraordinary men, and also probes the various psychologies of people whose job could kill them at any moment, as well as - briefly - exploring how they cope once away from their adrenaline-soaked vocation. Also starring Anthony Mackie, Ralph Fiennes, Guy Pearce, Brian Geraghty and Evangeline Lilly(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Creatures of the night find new prey on the scariest night of the year in this horror story. It's Halloween night, and four friends -- Allison (Vanessa Horneff), Elliott (Wil Horneff), Trevor (Karl Jacob), and Brian (Sean Reid) -- are on a road trip en route to a friend's wedding when their car breaks down after running into something. Looking for help, the four happen upon the farmhouse of an elderly couple, Elvin (Richard Little) and May (Barbara Wilhide), which is located next to a huge barn. Elvin and May have already become lost in the darkness of the barn, and soon two of the lost travelers are suffering the same fate as they search for friendly strangers. However, while they can barely see a hand in front of their face, they discover they're not alone in the barn, which has become home to a huge swarm of bloodthirsty bats. The Roost is framed by an introduction and postscript from a television horror show host, played by Tom Noonan(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">"Revenge" is the watchword of this black comedy that takes a keen look at the self-centeredness, blind ambition, cynicism, and amoral behavior in modern-day Hollywood. Buddy is the control-freak Hollywood production executive with a reputation for abusing his employees. He is particularly abusive to his young personal assistant Guy, a recent film-school graduate and naive Hollywood newcomer. The idealistic young Guy is routinely humiliated by Buddy. Unable to stand anymore abuse and no longer the naive idealist, Guy turns on Buddy. He ends up tying him up and then subjecting Buddy to all the sadism, and torture Buddy inflicted on others. He threatens to do even worse, but is deterred by an unexpected arrival, whose presence leads to a surprising final plot twist. The film was first shown at Telluride Film Festival as The Buddy Factor but was retitled for its general release in 1995(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Resurrecting the Champ</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director and co-screenwriter (along with Chris Gerolmo, Allison Burnett, and Michael Bortman) Rod Lurie tells the uplifting tale of a sports writer who almost lost it all before stumbling into the story of a lifetime in this uplifting sports-themed drama starring Josh Hartnett and Samuel L. Jackson. Erik (Hartnett) is a Denver-based sports writer whose prose is dull and whose marriage is failing. Not only is Erik having a difficult time dealing with his stubborn editor Metz (Alan Alda) - who refuses to take the suffering scribe off of the boxing beat - but the pain of being separated from his young son has weighed heavier on Erik's conscience than he could have ever imagined. When Erik sees a local homeless man (Samuel L. Jackson) being violently assaulted by a gang of sadistic street toughs, he instinctively comes to the suffering man's rescue. As fate would have, Erik discovers that the nondescript homeless man is actually the former boxing champion Battling Bob Satterfield, whom many sports fans had assumed dead. Now driven to tell the story that may establish him as a successful sports writer, Erik gradually begins to make the transformation from ordinary man to extraordinary champion - largely by turning inward and by reexamining his relationship with his own son(n)</desc>

Entering a shabby corner bar, Pedott provides the customer with trivial items which turn out to be exactly what they need to improve their lives. Impressed by this, hoodlum Fred Renard Steve Cochran purchases a pair of scissors which later, amazingly, save his life. Becoming greedy, Fred browbeats Pedott into giving him even more beneficial items -- with disastrous results for one of the two men.

In the original radio version, the protagonist was a young man named Ronald Adams, played by Orson Welles. Deducing that TV viewers would be more emotionally affected by a woman in distress, Serling rewrote the main character as Nan Adams, with Inger Stevens filling the role. While making a cross-country motor trip, Nan is terrified by the repeated appearances of a shabby-looking hitchhiker (Leonard Strong) who shows up at every turn and who seems to be beckoning her to. . .what? Classic line: "I believe you're. . .going my way."

    <desc lang="en">Director Joe Carnahan's big-screen take, co-produced by Tony and Ridley Scott, on the 80s TV series, which was an OTT action-fest that, at the same time, gloried in and poked fun at its tough-guy stars and their adventures. This time around, a little brasher and more serious than their first incarnation, the team of soldiers comprises the cigar-chomping Col 'Hannibal' Smith, the wilfully eccentric Murdock, toned babe-magnet Face and, of course, BA Baracus, who famously 'pities the fool', usually with more forceful fisticuffing than is strictly necessary. Our quartet starts out on the back foot, having been jailed after a black ops mission in Iraq went disastrously wrong. But, discovering they were framed and that a massive currency counterfeiting operation is afoot, it's time for them to break out of prison and prove their innocence by tracking down the baddies and saving the US dollar. And, of course, blowing up as many objects as possible along the way. Also featuring Jessica Biel as Face's former flame and Patrick Wilson as the team's CIA handler(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Die Hard</title>
    <desc lang="en">It's Christmas time in L.A., and there's an employee party in progress on the 30th floor of the Nakatomi Corporation building. The revelry comes to a violent end when the partygoers are taken hostage by a group of terrorists headed by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), who plan to steal the 600 million dollars locked in Nakatomi's high-tech safe. In truth, Gruber and his henchmen are only pretending to be politically motivated to throw the authorities off track; also in truth, Gruber has no intention of allowing anyone to get out of the building alive. Meanwhile, New York cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) has come to L.A. to visit his estranged wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), who happens to be one of the hostages. Disregarding the orders of the authorities surrounding the building, McClane, who fears nothing (except heights), takes on the villains, armed with one handgun and plenty of chutzpah. Until Die Hard came along, Bruce Willis was merely that wisecracking guy on Moonlighting. After the film's profits started rolling in, Willis found himself one of the highest-paid and most sought-after leading men in Hollywood(n)</desc>
