    <title lang="en">There's Something About Romcoms</title>
    <desc lang="en">Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant, Richard Curtis, Rupert Everett and Stephen Merchant are among the stars celebrating the rich and varied history of the rom-com, which has become one of cinema's highest grossing film genres, and made stars of the likes Renee Zellweger and Kate Hudson, among many more of Hollywood's brightest stars. This programme revisits some of the greatest rom-coms moments ever committed to film, from Meg Ryan `climactic' scene in When Harry Met Sally to Andie MacDowall and Hugh Grant's romantic entanglements in Four Weddings and a Funeral. Tim Bevan, chairman of the production company Working Title, explains why he believes the British have surpassed American film-makers in the field of the romantic comedy, and Bridget Jones producer Jonathan Cavendish explains how the Texan Renee Zellweger was transformed into the unlucky-in-love Bridget - ahead of the release of the third film in the series next month. Narrated by Julie Walters.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Conjuring</title>
    <desc lang="en">A demonic entity lays claim to family living in a secluded farmhouse, prompting them to seek the aid of two renowned paranormal researchers in this tale of possession inspired by actual events. The story gets underway as paranormal researchers Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) evaluate a mysterious doll discovered by a trio of young roommates in 1968. Believing their house to be haunted by the wayward spirit of a deceased young girl, they give the girl permission to inhabit the doll, and soon their lives become a waking nightmare. Informed by Ed and Lorraine that they have fallen victim to an inhuman spirit (aka a demon) seeking a human host, the roommates entrust the doll to the Warrens, who place it in their personal museum for safekeeping. Flash forward three years to Harrisville, RI, where the Perron family have just moved into their country dream home -- an 18th century farmhouse that offers plenty of space for parents Carolyn (Lili Taylor) and Roger (Ron Livingston), as well as their five daughters Andrea (Shanley Caswell), Nancy (Hayley McFarland), Christine (Joey King), Cindy (Mackenzie Foy), and April (Kyla Deaver). It seems like the ideal place to raise a family until a series of unsettling events leave the Perron family convinced they are not alone. Terrified, Carolyn reaches out to the Warrens for help, and learns that a demonic entity has attached itself to her family, and has no intentions of letting them go. Meanwhile, the deeper the Warrens delve into the farmhouse's history, the clearer it becomes that this spirit has a murderous agenda, and that no one will be safe until it is driven back into darkness(n)</desc>

Griffin is a single guy who loves his job at the Franklin Park Zoo. He has a special bond with the animals, yet he can't help but feel lonely each night when he returns to an empty house. Eventually deciding that a more prestigious job may be the key to finding a new girlfriend, Griffin prepares to turn in his walking papers and reinvent himself. But when word gets out to the animals that Griffin will soon be leaving, they realize the only way to keep him around is to reveal they have the gift of the gab. Perhaps with a little dating advice from his friends in the animal kingdom, this lonely zookeeper will manage to meet the girl of his dreams without losing the job he loves. Rosario Dawson co-stars in a comedy featuring the voices of Sylvester Stallone, Adam Sandler, Cher, and Nick Nolte(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Shawshank Redemption</title>
    <desc lang="en">Based on a story by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption is the directorial debut of screenwriter Frank Darabont. In 1946, a banker named Andy Dufresne is convicted of a double murder, even though he stubbornly proclaims his innocence. He's sentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine, where another lifer, Ellis "Red" Redding, picks him as the new recruit most likely to crack under the pressure. The ugly realities of prison life are quickly introduced to Andy: a corrupt warden,sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley, and inmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or beatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the hope of the truly innocent, which allow him to prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with the warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal business schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the prison staff. In exchange, he is able to improve the prison library and bring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates, including Red. Starring Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins, Bob Gunton(n)</desc>

In a world parallel to our own, the worst has happened, and humanity is in danger of extinction. From the ashes of destruction emerges a courageous rag doll named 9 (voice of Elijah Wood) whose unique leadership skills could prove the key to survival for those who have not yet perished. Perhaps with a little help from his friends, who include domineering war veteran 1 (voice of Christopher Plummer), aging inventor 2 (voice of Martin Landau), stout mechanic 5 (voice of John C. Reilly), visionary artist 6 (voice of Crispin Glover), and fearless warrior 7 (voice of Jennifer Connelly), 9 will prove capable of salvaging what still remains of this world, and laying the groundwork for a hopeful future. Produced by Tim Burton, Timur Bekmambetov (Wanted, Night Watch), and Jim Lemley (The Diving Bell and the Butterfly), 9 takes viewers on a surrealistic journey into a world where anything is possible(n)</desc>

Produced entirely over the Internet, where writers uploaded story details and actors submitted audition tapes, Perkins' 14 was released into theaters as part of the third After Dark Horror Fest. Ronald Perkins was just six years old when his parents were brutally slaughtered right before his eyes. Unable to overcome the incredible trauma of witnessing such a diabolical event, Perkins becomes convinced that the killers who murdered his parents will eventually return to finish the job they started years ago -- and he plans to be fully prepared to fight back when they do. Years later, when Perkins turns 34, he kidnaps 14 people from his hometown of Stone Cove and sets about reprogramming them to become relentless killing machines. Now, if the killers ever do return, they'll have to get through Perkins' 14 in order to reach their intended target. Trouble is, now that Perkins' 14 are ready for battle, they've become increasingly difficult to contain(n)</desc>

There were no survivors and her body was never found. That rich, green, exotic land is left behind as Joe is challenged to persevere through sad, rainy days back home. Joe promised Emily that if anything ever happened to her, he would visit her patients in the oncology ward. Strangely, the children seem to know him, and they say they've seen Emily in their near-death experiences.

While the children see Joe as a kindred spirit, the hospital staff worries about how these interactions are agitating them. At home, Joe begins finding other ethereal evidence of his wife's attempt to contact him from beyond the grave, some of it featuring the image of a dragonfly, which was the shape of the birthmark on her shoulder.

    <title lang="en">American Wedding</title>
    <desc lang="en">The third film of the successful American Pie series, which started to shake the box-offices in 1999. Jim (Jason Biggs) is about to marry Michelle, while his crazy friends, Finch, Stifler and Kevin, still have their hormones somewhat worked up. Apart from rushing to make all the arrangements for the wedding, Jim must strive to gain the approval of his parents-in-law, and, to make matters worse, he has to battle with the restrictions of his grandmother, who is against the wedding because Michelle is not Jewish. In addition, the arrival of Cadence, the bride's youngest sister, completely upsets the situation. Finch and Stifler fall in love with her and start a heated dispute, where one of them is the rebel, and the other, prince charming. Of course, a crazy stag party could not be left out. The director of this film, Jesse Dylan, is Bob Dylan's son(n)</desc>

Jeremy Clarkson pilots the Lexus LFA, which has a spectacularly high-revving V10 powerplant, Richard Hammond gets behind the wheel of the muscular Dodge Viper, and James May opts for the latest incarnation of Aston Martin's Vanquish.

A price restriction leads Jeremy to grab the keys to a Shelby Mustang GT500, which costs the equivalent of £35,000 in America and packs a supercharged punch of more than 650bhp. James and Richard pin their hopes on the pan-European rail network in a bid to secure the prize of tickets to a top-flight football match, with nothing but a long journey home awaiting the losers. On the test track, Jeremy puts Toyota's GT86 coupe through its paces, and its promise of entertaining rear-wheel-drive handling should put a smile on his face.

    <desc lang="en">Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May embark on a race from London's Wembley Stadium to Milan's San Siro, the home of Italian football giants AC and Inter. A price restriction leads Jeremy to grab the keys to a Shelby Mustang GT500, which costs the equivalent of £35,000 in America and packs a supercharged punch of more than 650bhp. James and Richard pin their hopes on the pan-European rail network in a bid to secure the prize of tickets to a top-flight football match, with nothing but a long journey home awaiting the losers. On the test track, Jeremy puts Toyota's GT86 coupe through its paces, and its promise of entertaining rear-wheel-drive handling should put a smile on his face. Plus, singer-songwriter Amy Macdonald gets to grips with the Reasonably Priced Car.(n)</desc>

On her travels, she finds several animals that have discovered the secrets of successful long-lasting relationship, including the bonobo of the Congo, Africa's wild dogs and tamarins in the UK. But there are other sides to the story, like the devoted penguin couple that stayed together for 10 years, only for things to turn out not quite as they seemed.

    <desc lang="en">Biologist Patrick Aryee and physicist Helen Czerski explore the world of animal senses to reveal how they detect things beyond the limits of human perception, conducting experiments and demonstrations featuring a variety of species. They begin by investigating sight and reveal how caribou - wild reindeer of Alaska - use ultraviolet light to avoid their predators. They also discover how the dragonfly's ability to view things in slow motion allows it to make a kill, and show how a snake can see in the pitch dark without using its eyes.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Biologist Patrick Aryee and physicist Helen Czerski explore the world of animal senses to reveal how they detect things beyond the limits of human perception, conducting experiments and demonstrations featuring a variety of species. They begin by investigating sight and reveal how caribou - wild reindeer of Alaska - use ultraviolet light to avoid their predators. They also discover how the dragonfly's ability to view things in slow motion allows it to make a kill, and show how a snake can see in the pitch dark without using its eyes.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Gerard Butler stars in Marc Forster's violent, fact-based drama about a substance-addicted criminal who finds God and relocates to Sudan to offer his own idiosyncratic brand of Christian charity. The film initially portrays Sam Childers as being a far from nice man: a misogynistic biker whose life is steeped in crime, narcotics and violence, and who quickly returns to armed robbery almost as soon as he's released from jail. But while he was inside, his wife Lynn found Jesus, and, after Sam gets stabbed, she urges him to join her at church. Sam subsequently has his own Damascene moment and starts life afresh, founding his own (legitimate) construction company. Before long he has also built his own church. But it's only after a trip to Sudan, where he witnesses the devastation wrought by the marauding Lord's Resistance Army, that he truly becomes driven. Relocating to the African country, he sets up a faith-based centre to care for victims of the LRA's violence and rape. And also takes up arms to literally fight the good fight... Also starring Michael Shannon(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Surfer, Dude</title>
    <desc lang="en">Hands on a Hard Body director S.R. Bindler directs this wave-twisting tale of a soul-searching surfer (Matthew McConaughey) in the midst of an existential crisis. Steve Addington (McConaughey) is an herb-toking long-boarder with a keen sense of balance and a mellow outlook on life. Upon returning to his hometown of Malibu to spend the summer with old friends, Steve begins to sense that the good vibes he remembers as a boy have been hopelessly corrupted by the powers that be. When the earthen surfer is faced with the prospect of expanding into virtual-reality video games and reality television or risk being rendered irrelevant, he opts to keep riding the majestic Southern California waves rather than participate in this new digital reality. Fate seems to intercede, however, when the ocean simply ceases to produce any suitable waves. His finances dried up, his sponsored expense accounts suddenly canceled, and his friends flocking off to bluer pastures, the surfer without a wave suddenly realizes that he has but two choices in life: he can either sit tight and try to keep his sanity until the waves come rolling in again, or finally give in to the Man and his intoxicating world of artificial amusements. Perhaps with a little wisdom from his trusted manager (Woody Harrelson), his aging mentor (Scott Glenn), his guardian angel (Willie Nelson), and his newfound muse (Alexie Gilmore), Addington can somehow manage to maintain his mellow just long enough to put it all into perspective and get back to the basics(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">X-Men: Days of Future Past</title>
    <desc lang="en">In order to prevent a grim future in which mutants and their human sympathizers are systematically hunted and killed by towering, unstoppable robots called Sentinels, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) travels back in time to change the course of history in this sequel that finds X-Men and X2: X-Men United director Bryan Singer returning to the helm. The film opens in a dark and desolate future that was set in motion in 1973, when brilliant scientist Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage) created a series of giant robots called Sentinels for the sole purpose of wiping out mutants, whom he claimed were a direct threat to the human race. Although initially programmed solely to target mutants, the Sentinels soon began eradicating humans who possessed the DNA to breed mutants, and eventually, any mortal mutant sympathizers. Desperate, Prof. Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen) devise a plan to have Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) send Wolverine back to the year when Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) assassinated Trask -- it turns out that Mystique inadvertently accelerated the Sentinel program when she was subsequently captured by Sgt. William Stryker (Josh Helman), who succeeded at harvesting her DNA to make the robots more powerful than ever before. Upon arriving in the past, Wolverine quickly seeks out a much younger Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), as well as Beast (Nicholas Hoult) and Quicksilver (Evan Peters), and together they help break a young Magneto (Michael Fassbender) out of a heavily fortified prison cell hundreds of feet beneath the Pentagon. Meanwhile, with the help of Havok, Ink, Toad, and Spike, Mystique is already moving in for the kill. Although Wolverine, Beast, Charles, and Magneto manage to thwart the assassination, Charles and Magneto once again find themselves at odds after the latter attempts to alter the plan at the last moment, creating a mass panic during a post-Vietnam War peace summit in Paris. And Dr. Trask, still fuming from having had the Sentinel program rejected by Congress, takes his proposal directly to President Nixon (Mark Camacho), laying the groundwork for an even darker future than the one Wolverine was sent back to prevent(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">X-Men: Days of Future Past</title>
    <desc lang="en">In order to prevent a grim future in which mutants and their human sympathizers are systematically hunted and killed by towering, unstoppable robots called Sentinels, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) travels back in time to change the course of history in this sequel that finds X-Men and X2: X-Men United director Bryan Singer returning to the helm. The film opens in a dark and desolate future that was set in motion in 1973, when brilliant scientist Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage) created a series of giant robots called Sentinels for the sole purpose of wiping out mutants, whom he claimed were a direct threat to the human race. Although initially programmed solely to target mutants, the Sentinels soon began eradicating humans who possessed the DNA to breed mutants, and eventually, any mortal mutant sympathizers. Desperate, Prof. Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen) devise a plan to have Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) send Wolverine back to the year when Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) assassinated Trask -- it turns out that Mystique inadvertently accelerated the Sentinel program when she was subsequently captured by Sgt. William Stryker (Josh Helman), who succeeded at harvesting her DNA to make the robots more powerful than ever before. Upon arriving in the past, Wolverine quickly seeks out a much younger Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), as well as Beast (Nicholas Hoult) and Quicksilver (Evan Peters), and together they help break a young Magneto (Michael Fassbender) out of a heavily fortified prison cell hundreds of feet beneath the Pentagon. Meanwhile, with the help of Havok, Ink, Toad, and Spike, Mystique is already moving in for the kill. Although Wolverine, Beast, Charles, and Magneto manage to thwart the assassination, Charles and Magneto once again find themselves at odds after the latter attempts to alter the plan at the last moment, creating a mass panic during a post-Vietnam War peace summit in Paris. And Dr. Trask, still fuming from having had the Sentinel program rejected by Congress, takes his proposal directly to President Nixon (Mark Camacho), laying the groundwork for an even darker future than the one Wolverine was sent back to prevent(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Baby Mama</title>
    <desc lang="en">Former Saturday Night Live "Weekend Update" co-anchors Tina Fey and Amy Poehler co-star in this baby-fever comedy about a single, career-oriented woman who previously put parenthood on hold, and is forced to hire a surrogate mother when she discovers there is only a one-in-a-million chance that she will be able to get pregnant. Kate Holbrook (Fey) is a 37-year-old business executive who has always put her professional life before her personal life, but these days her biological clock is ticking louder than ever before. As with everything else she has accomplished in life, Kate is determined to have a child on her own terms. Unfortunately for Kate, the chance of her ever becoming pregnant is slim to none. Undaunted, a willful Kate drafts South Philly working-class girl Angie Ostrowiski (Poehler) -- a woman who may just be her polar opposite -- to be a surrogate mother. Subsequently informed by the head of the surrogacy center (Sigourney Weaver) that her surrogate is indeed pregnant, the excited mother-to-be soon purchases every child-rearing book she can find and excitedly begins the nesting process. But life hasn't quit throwing Kate curveballs just yet, because when a pregnant Angie shows up on her doorstep with no place to live, the woman who once thrived on order finds her life descending into chaos. Now, as Kate attempts to transform Angie into the ideal expectant mother, this odd couple will discover that families aren't always biological, but occasionally formed through friendship as well. Writer Michael McCullers, who authored the screenplays for Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and Undercover Brother in addition to working on Saturday Night Live, makes his feature directorial debut with a self-penned screenplay(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Heartbreakers</title>
    <desc lang="en">After the little white lies of Romy and Michele's High School Reunion (1997), director David Mirkin focuses on scheming of a different sort in Heartbreakers. Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt play Max and Page Conners, a mother and daughter who share everything with each other: relationship advice, hair and makeup hints, and the money they win in costly divorce settlements with rich men. When the film opens, the Conners are putting the finishing touches on conning Dean (Ray Liotta), an auto-body shop owner. When the dust from that scam clears, Page announces she's ready to move away from her mother and set up shop on her own -- but in order to clear an outstanding debt, Max insists they bankrupt one more bachelor together. They settle upon phlegmatic Palm Springs widower William B. Tensy (Gene Hackman), a chain smoker with a heart of gold and a similarly bountiful bank account. Only two things stand in their way: Tensy's Teutonic caretaker Miss Madress (Nora Dunn) and beachfront bartender Jack (Jason Lee), a wry stargazer with whom Page becomes unexpectedly smitten. Heartbreakers is the third collaboration from writers Steven Mazur and Paul Guy, whose previous screwball comedy was 1997's international hit, Liar Liar(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The ads for Arthur suggested that this was an obnoxious film about an obnoxious man, an eternally drunken millionaire indulging his every whim. Instead, Arthur (Dudley Moore) is a sweet, somewhat pathetic character whose millions have left him lonely and with no motivation in life. When the film opens, Arthur is on the threshold of an arranged marriage with simpering socialite Susan (Jill Eikenberry), whom he does not love. Everyone expects Arthur to behave himself, but nobody truly cares for his well-being, with the exception of father-figure butler Mr. Hobson (John Gielgud, who won an Oscar for his performance) and blue-collar shoplifter Linda (Liza Minnelli). Arthur would prefer to marry the lowly Linda, but his iron-willed grandmother (Geraldine Fitzgerald) threatens to pull the plug on his huge inheritance if he doesn't honor his position in life and go through with his marriage to Susan. A sequel, Arthur 2: On the Rocks, followed in 1988(n)</desc>

In Lost and Found, David Spade plays Dylan, who is about to open an new restaurant and has finally found the perfect apartment. The apartment just gets better when he meets his new neighbor, Lila (Sophie Marceau), a very beautiful women who has recently come to the United States from France. However, Lila has just gotten out of a bad relationship with René (Patrick Bruel), who doesn't want to leave her alone, so she has little interest in romance, preferring to devote herself to her cello and her dog Jack. One day, Jack runs away and Dylan finds him; when he returns the pooch to Lila, it's the first time she's been willing to speak in full sentences to him, though not for very long. Faster than you can say "That idea is so crazy it just might work!", Dylan decides to kidnap Jack; when Lila thinks the dog is lost, Dylan will generously volunteer to help look for him, which will give Dylan a chance to impress Lila when he's able to find Jack so quickly. Sure enough, Dylan swipes the dog, but from that point on the plan hardly goes the way he had hoped. Star David Spade also co-wrote the screenplay with J.B.

    <desc lang="en">Based on the 1999 bestseller by K.C. McKinnon, this touching Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation stars Alicia Silverstone as Dee Dee, a single mom and professional candlemaker who returns to her Maine hometown after a lengthy absence. Having left town with a somewhat sullied reputation, she returns with apparently the best of intentions--bringing her 12-year-old son Trooper (Matthew Knight) along for the sentimental journey. Dee Dee's reappearance is initially met with hostility by veterinarian Lydia, whose husband (and coworker) Sam had once been Dee Dee's sweetheart. Ultimately, however, Lydia warms up to both her "rival" and her son--just before Dee Dee poignantly reveals the real reason for her unexpected homecoming. Filmed for television on location in Nova Scotia, Candles on Bay Street was first broadcast by CBS on November 26, 2006(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Friday the 13th</title>
    <desc lang="en">(2009) Director Marcus Nispel seems to have a bit of a thing for remakes, having remoulded The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in 2003, as well as Conan the Barbarian in 2011. However, in this slasher horror, Nispel compresses elements of the first four films in the Friday the 13th franchise, which started way back in 1980, into one blood-sodden whole. This retread gives some background as to why Jason Voorhees (Derek Mears) became such a relentlessly homicidal maniac, before getting on with the business of steel on flesh and bucketloads of gore, delivering the movie's raison d'être. Some weeks after his sister goes missing, Clay Miller's (Jared Padalecki) search for his sibling leads him to Crystal Lake, a remote, wooded campsite. Also arriving at the spot is a group of young revellers, intent on partying. But it's not long before the man with the hockey mask and machete pays them a visit - one that any survivors are unlikely to forget. Can any of them escape Voorhees' latest murderous rampage? Or will they all vanish like Clay's sister and her friends?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The discovery of a Roman sword with traces of blood on it is linked to an unidentified, headless corpse found near Heathrow in March 2008. It leads the team members to a lock-up belonging to a bodybuilder called Mark Rix, who died of a suspected heart attack the same year, so they start looking for connections between the original murder and Rix's death. They are helped in their investigation by anthropologist Fiona Kennedy, for whom Dan begins to develop feelings - just as he is told his wife might be discharged from the secure hospital where she has spent the past several years. Tracy-Ann Obermann and Liz White guest star.(n)</desc>

Not used to balancing his new life with his old, Todd mistakenly invites family and friends from his old neighborhood to his multi-million-dollar house for a cookout on the same day of an important endorsement interview. Though his extravagant family cookouts were welcome at his old digs, Todd's stuffy new neighbors -- particularly the conservative Republican Judge Halsted Crowley (Danny Glover) -- are less than thrilled with the arrival of Todd's massive family. Complicating the situation further is the eccentric neighborhood security guard (Queen Latifah), who takes on the heady assignment of ensuring that none of the private community's rules are broken, as well as two thugs who, determined to get an autographed pair of sneakers, hold up the cookout at gunpoint. Directed by Lance Rivera, The Cookout also features performances from Ja Rule, Eve, Farrah Fawcett, and Jonathan Silverman(n)</desc>

Leather quickly assembles a team which digs a tunnel directly into a London bank's vault. But what he hasn't been told is that, in addition to the money, he'll also be stealing a safety box containing material that would be extremely damaging to the royal family if it saw the light of day. Another box they take holds further dramatic revelations concerning establishment figures. So it's not long before Leather and the gang are pursued by the police, MI5 and various thugs, all keen to get their hands on the incendiary information... Edited for sexual scenes(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The film follows a Jewish family living in Hungary through three generations, and rising from humble beginnings to positions of wealth and power in the crumbling Austro-Hungarian Empire. Ignatz, the patriarch rises from poverty to become a prominent judge and model conservative. But his prosperity proves short-lived, since he must eventually confront the changing attitudes of the Hungarian majority. Ignatz is torn when his government sanctions Jewish persecutions, something that creates a rift between him and his beloved wife Valerie (played alternately by veteran actress Rosemary Harris and her daughter Jennifer Ehle), while his brother Gustave, fearful of the growing anti-semitic feeling, throws himself into Communism instead. His son Adam (also played by Fiennes) converts to Christianity to advance his career as a champion fencer and Olympic hero, but finds his patriotism rejected as he is inexorably caught up in the Holocaust. Finally, Istvan (Fiennes again), his grandson, who must constantly change his allegiances in order to survive the war, revolution, loss and betrayal, realizes that his ultimate loyalty must be to his family, his heritage, and himself(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Director Kathryn Bigelow's Iraq War-set action thriller presents the conflict in the Middle East from the perspective of those who witnessed the fighting firsthand -- the soldiers. As an elite Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal team tactfully navigates the streets of present-day Iraq, they face the constant threat of death from incoming bombs and sharp-shooting snipers. In Baghdad, roadside bombs are a common danger. The Army is working to make the city a safer place for Americans and Iraqis, so when it comes to dismantling IEDs (improvised explosive devices) the Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) crew is always on their game. But protecting the public isn't easy when there's no room for error, and every second spent dismantling a bomb is another second spent flirting with death. Now, as three fearless bomb technicians take on the most dangerous job in Baghdad, it's only a matter of time before one of them gets sent to "the hurt locker." Starring Jeremy Renner, Guy Pearce, and Ralph Fiennes(n)</desc>

Not used to balancing his new life with his old, Todd mistakenly invites family and friends from his old neighborhood to his multi-million-dollar house for a cookout on the same day of an important endorsement interview. Though his extravagant family cookouts were welcome at his old digs, Todd's stuffy new neighbors -- particularly the conservative Republican Judge Halsted Crowley (Danny Glover) -- are less than thrilled with the arrival of Todd's massive family. Complicating the situation further is the eccentric neighborhood security guard (Queen Latifah), who takes on the heady assignment of ensuring that none of the private community's rules are broken, as well as two thugs who, determined to get an autographed pair of sneakers, hold up the cookout at gunpoint. Directed by Lance Rivera, The Cookout also features performances from Ja Rule, Eve, Farrah Fawcett, and Jonathan Silverman(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The film follows a Jewish family living in Hungary through three generations, and rising from humble beginnings to positions of wealth and power in the crumbling Austro-Hungarian Empire. Ignatz, the patriarch rises from poverty to become a prominent judge and model conservative. But his prosperity proves short-lived, since he must eventually confront the changing attitudes of the Hungarian majority. Ignatz is torn when his government sanctions Jewish persecutions, something that creates a rift between him and his beloved wife Valerie (played alternately by veteran actress Rosemary Harris and her daughter Jennifer Ehle), while his brother Gustave, fearful of the growing anti-semitic feeling, throws himself into Communism instead. His son Adam (also played by Fiennes) converts to Christianity to advance his career as a champion fencer and Olympic hero, but finds his patriotism rejected as he is inexorably caught up in the Holocaust. Finally, Istvan (Fiennes again), his grandson, who must constantly change his allegiances in order to survive the war, revolution, loss and betrayal, realizes that his ultimate loyalty must be to his family, his heritage, and himself(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Roost</title>
    <desc lang="en">Creatures of the night find new prey on the scariest night of the year in this horror story. It's Halloween night, and four friends -- Allison (Vanessa Horneff), Elliott (Wil Horneff), Trevor (Karl Jacob), and Brian (Sean Reid) -- are on a road trip en route to a friend's wedding when their car breaks down after running into something. Looking for help, the four happen upon the farmhouse of an elderly couple, Elvin (Richard Little) and May (Barbara Wilhide), which is located next to a huge barn. Elvin and May have already become lost in the darkness of the barn, and soon two of the lost travelers are suffering the same fate as they search for friendly strangers. However, while they can barely see a hand in front of their face, they discover they're not alone in the barn, which has become home to a huge swarm of bloodthirsty bats. The Roost is framed by an introduction and postscript from a television horror show host, played by Tom Noonan(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Curious filmgoers looking to get better acquainted with the silver screen's most notorious cannibalistic serial killer are sure to get their fair share of shocks and thrills as director Peter Webber teams with author Thomas Harris to explore the early life of well-read psychopath Hannibal Lecter. Based on author Harris' gruesome novel of the same name, Hannibal Rising travels back in time to World War II-era Lithuania, where an impressionable, well-to-do young boy named Hannibal (Gaspard Ulliel) was forced to watch helplessly as his family was massacred and his young sister suffered a terrifying fate at the hands of desperate, famished soldiers. After seeking temporary shelter at the Soviet orphanage that was once his family's home, Hannibal later flees to Paris in search of his long-lost uncle. Though his uncle has passed away, his uncle's beautiful Japanese widow, Lady Murasaki (Gong Li), warmly accepts the frightened orphan into her home. But even the love and kindness of this generous stranger isn't enough to calm the raging storm that is brewing inside this troubled young boy. Plagued by nightmares and determined to seek vengeance on the murderous war criminals who brutalized his family, the profoundly disturbed but academically gifted Hannibal enrolls in medical school in order to hone the skills that will allow him to exact horrific justice(n)</desc>

The filmmakers reveal that there was much more to his career than that infamous tale, and that his outsized personality and racial pride made him an outspoken and important figure in baseball history. The movie also touches on his personal demons that led him to turn to drugs. No No: A Dockumentary screened at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Robocop</title>
    <desc lang="en">A powerful multinational conglomerate attempts to bring robotic law enforcement to the United States by transforming a critically injured police officer into a cyborg cop in this remake of the subversive 1987 sci-fi classic. The year is 2028. For a long time, cutting-edge robotics company OmniCorp has been supplying the U.S. military with drones for use overseas, though their repeated attempts to bring the technology stateside has met with fierce resistance. When devoted family man and upstanding Detroit policeman Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) is grievously wounded in the line of duty, OmniCorp CEO Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton) attempts to innovate by recruiting top scientist Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman) to transform Murphy into a prototype half-man/half-robot crime-fighter. When initial tests fail to provide the results OmniCorp had hoped for, Norton reprograms Robocop to operate strictly on software rather than human emotion. Later, Robocop finally hits the streets, and the citizens of the crime-ridden city welcome him with open arms. But as Murphy's emotions begin to interfere with his programming, he sets out to find the criminals who nearly killed him, and ensure that justice is served. Abbie Cornish, Samuel L. Jackson, Jay Baruchel, and Jackie Earle Haley co-star(n)</desc>

Scientist Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) is working with a secret military research team headed by Dr. Kramer (William Devane), assigned to create new intelligence technology. With the help of his colleagues Linda McKay (Elisabeth Shue) and Matt Kensington (Josh Brolin), Sebastian has been developing a serum that makes people invisible. The formula is new and unstable, but after a risky but successful test on an ape, an impatient Sebastian, under pressure from Kramer, decides to try it on himself. It works, but no one counted on the side effects; unable to reverse the serum's effects, an invisible Sebastian goes insane, and begins pursuing Linda (his former girlfriend) and Matt (Linda's current beau) in a fog of homicidal rage. Directed by Paul Verhoeven, Hollow Man also features Kim Dickens, Mary Randle, Joey Slotnick, and Greg Grunberg(n)</desc>

Scientist Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) is working with a secret military research team headed by Dr. Kramer (William Devane), assigned to create new intelligence technology. With the help of his colleagues Linda McKay (Elisabeth Shue) and Matt Kensington (Josh Brolin), Sebastian has been developing a serum that makes people invisible. The formula is new and unstable, but after a risky but successful test on an ape, an impatient Sebastian, under pressure from Kramer, decides to try it on himself. It works, but no one counted on the side effects; unable to reverse the serum's effects, an invisible Sebastian goes insane, and begins pursuing Linda (his former girlfriend) and Matt (Linda's current beau) in a fog of homicidal rage. Directed by Paul Verhoeven, Hollow Man also features Kim Dickens, Mary Randle, Joey Slotnick, and Greg Grunberg(n)</desc>

It's hard being a rat with culinary aspirations, but Remy is convinced he has what it takes to break the stereotypes and follow in the footsteps of star chef Auguste Gusteau (voice of Brad Garrett). As fate would have it, Remy is currently situated in the sewers directly beneath Gusteau's elegant restaurant. Soon Remy teams up with a young chef with little talent named Linguini (voice of Lou Romano). Together they are able to create some fabulous dishes, but they live in fear that someone will discover their secret and object strenuously to a rat being in a kitchen. When Remy's passion for cooking turns the haughty world of French cuisine upside down, the rat who would be king of the kitchen learns important lessons about life, friends, and family while questioning whether he should pursue his culinary calling or simply go back underground and return to his life as a sewer rat(n)</desc>

However, behind closed doors those around him were trying to think of a way to package him as something he was not: bi-white. This candid account of what really happened in and around his 'fairytale' life is taken from his private journals, interviews with his widow Maria and contributions from other family members, Tony Bennett, Buddy Greco, Harry Belafonte, Nancy Wilson, Sir Bruce Forsyth, George Benson, Aaron Neville, Johnny Mathis and many more.

    <desc lang="en">Austin Powers -- fashion photographer, denizen of Swingin' London, international espionage agent, and bane of dental hygienists everywhere -- returns in his second screen adventure. Powers (once again played by Mike Myers), a 1960s superspy stranded in the 1990s, discovers that his nemesis, criminal genius Dr. Evil (also Mike Myers), has somehow stolen his "mojo" (the secret to his otherwise inexplicable sex appeal) and traveled back in time to the 1960s as part of his latest fiendish scheme. Powers must also travel back in time to retrieve it, but if Austin doesn't quite fit into 1998, he's been there just long enough not to fit in in 1968 anymore, either. Powers also discovers that Dr. Evil has new allies this time: Mini-Me (Verne Troyer), a clone of Dr. Evil one-eighth his size but just as nasty; Fat Bastard (Myers yet again), whose name describes him just fine; and vixenish assassin Robin Swallows (Gia Carides). Powers' lack of mojo also proves troublesome when he's paired with his new partner, saucy CIA operative Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham). Other characters returning from the first film include Elizabeth Hurley as Vanessa Kensington, Robert Wagner as Number Two, Michael York as Basil Exposition, Seth Green as Scott Evil, and Mindy Sterling as Frau Farbissina. Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me also includes cameo appearances from Tim Robbins, Jerry Springer, Woody Harrelson, and Burt Bacharach with his current songwriting partner, Elvis Costello(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Andy Tennant's romantic comedy fantasy is set in 16th-century France, where, following the death of her father, Danielle De Barbarac is assigned kitchen duties in the castle by her stepmother Baroness Rodmilla de Ghent. A chance meeting with Prince Henry, heir apparent to the throne, leads to the potential for a romance that she fears could be ruined if he discovers a masquerade. A 'fairy-godmother' in the shape of Leonardo da Vinci eventually smoothes the path of true love but thanks to Barrymore, this is not another soft retelling of Cinderella but a punchy, energetic film with Barrymore in excellent form as the forthright Danielle.

    <desc lang="en">Inspired by the 1957 film An Affair to Remember, Sleepless in Seattle is a light romantic comedy about a recently-engaged journalist named Annie (Meg Ryan) who sets out on a cross-country trip to meet Sam (Tom Hanks) after hearing his son's phone call to a radio talk show. Though she has never met Sam, Annie is convinced by his son's plea, for his father to find a new wife, that she is destined to be his lover. Nora Ephron's script is light and engaging, full of fine, gentle jokes, while both Ryan and Hanks give thoroughly winning performances, as does Rosie O'Donnell as Ryan's best friend, Becky(n)</desc>
