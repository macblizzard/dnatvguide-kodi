    <title lang="en">Michael</title>
    <desc lang="en">Traditionally, angels are supposed to have snowy wings, spotless flowing robes and be bathed in heavenly light, but not Michael (John Travolta). With a hairy pot belly, long hair, a cigarette addiction, an insatiable sugar craving and filthy wings, the archangel Michael is anything but angelic looking. His unkempt appearance and the fact that he is found holed up in a ramshackle boarding house in a beat-up Iowa backwater, makes it even harder to believe that he is anything but a bum. Still when the publisher of the National Mirror, the country's top tabloid learns there may be an angel afoot, he sends three reporters out to cover the story. Slightly embittered writer Frank Quinlan (William Hurt) hopes the story will bust him out of his slump. Hapless photographer Huey (Robert Pastorelli) worries that one more botched job will cause publisher Vartan Malt (Bob Hoskins) to take away his one lucrative gig shooting celebrity wonder-dog Sparky. The enigmatic Dorothy (Andie MacDowell) is supposedly an expert on all things angelic. Together the disparate trio travel to Iowa and meet Pansy Millbank (Jean Stapleton) the aged owner of a run-down rooming house who tells them how Michael miraculously saved her from financial ruin. In return, she allows him to stay at her place. Naturally, the reporters want to meet this phenomenon, but they are ill-prepared at what groggily stumps down the stairs to greet them. From the stubble-faced, boxer-short wearing, smouldering mess before them, they learn that all high-ranking angels are allowed 26 Earthly vacations for all eternity. This is Michael's final vacation and he wants to have fun. The reporters only want to get as much publicity as they can from their ethereal visitor and so set off with him to Chicago. Along the way, they have many funny misadventures(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">WALL-E</title>
    <desc lang="en">Disney and Pixar join forces for this computer-animated tale about a wide-eyed robot who travels to the deepest reaches of outer space in search of a newfound friend. The year is 2700, and planet Earth has long been uninhabitable. For hundreds of years, WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) has been taking out the trash, and collecting precious knick-knacks in order to stave off the boredom of his dreary routine. Little does WALL-E realize that he has recently stumbled onto a secret that could save planet Earth, and once again make the ravaged planet safe for all humankind. When highly advanced search robot EVE makes friends with WALL-E and realizes the value of his remarkable discovery, she excitedly races back to let the humans know that there's hope for their home planet after all. But after centuries alone in space, WALL-E can't stand the thought of losing the only friend he's ever known, and eagerly follows her into the deepest reaches of space on the adventure of a lifetime. Along the way, the friendly trash-collecting robot who has always known what he was made for gradually begins to understand what he was meant for. Finding Nemo director Andrew Stanton returns to the helm for this family-friendly sci-fi adventure featuring the voices of Fred Willard, Jeff Garlin, and Ben Burtt(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">WALL-E</title>
    <desc lang="en">Disney and Pixar join forces for this computer-animated tale about a wide-eyed robot who travels to the deepest reaches of outer space in search of a newfound friend. The year is 2700, and planet Earth has long been uninhabitable. For hundreds of years, WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) has been taking out the trash, and collecting precious knick-knacks in order to stave off the boredom of his dreary routine. Little does WALL-E realize that he has recently stumbled onto a secret that could save planet Earth, and once again make the ravaged planet safe for all humankind. When highly advanced search robot EVE makes friends with WALL-E and realizes the value of his remarkable discovery, she excitedly races back to let the humans know that there's hope for their home planet after all. But after centuries alone in space, WALL-E can't stand the thought of losing the only friend he's ever known, and eagerly follows her into the deepest reaches of space on the adventure of a lifetime. Along the way, the friendly trash-collecting robot who has always known what he was made for gradually begins to understand what he was meant for. Finding Nemo director Andrew Stanton returns to the helm for this family-friendly sci-fi adventure featuring the voices of Fred Willard, Jeff Garlin, and Ben Burtt(n)</desc>

They play paperhangers working in the Kingdom of Moronica. After overthrowing the king, evil cabinet ministers elect Moe Hailstone new ruler, naturally counting on his stupidity. Moe becomes Dictator ("Moronica must expand! We shall lend our neighbors a helping hand, we shall lend them two helping hands ... and help ourselves to the neighbors!"); Larry is named Minister of Propaganda (Moe: " What do you mean by reading a book? Loyal Moronicans shouldn't read! Take your troops out and burn every book!"); and Curly becomes Field Marshall. A glamorous female spy (Lorna Gray aka Adrian Booth) gets in the way of governing and the Stooges are run out of the country by the mob. Their fate is especially gruesome: they are eaten by lions!(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Live Six Nations Rugby Union</title>
    <sub-title lang="en">Scotland v Italy.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Scotland v Italy (Kick-off 12.30pm). Gabby Logan presents coverage of the opening match on the final day of the championship, which takes place at Murrayfield. Italy have yet to pick up a single point in the championship despite occasional signs of improvement under coach Conor O'Shea, although much of the focus will be on Scotland coach Vern Cotter as he takes charge for the final time. The New Zealander will be replaced by Gregor Townsend in June and will be looking to end his reign in style following an encouraging campaign, although he could be without several key players following their thrashing at the hands of England last weekend. With commentary by Andrew Cotter and Chris Paterson.(n)</desc>

Wales have an excellent recent record against France, but the outcome of this match is hard to predict, with the hosts showing signs of improvement under Guy Noves despite narrow losses to England and Ireland, while Wales have performed well below the standards set in recent years. Both sides have won two and lost two of their matches and could finish anywhere between second and fifth in the standings. With commentary by Eddie Butler and Jonathan Davies.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Katie Derham makes use of archive footage and family records to tell the story of how Vera Lynn came to become one of the UK's most well-known musical stars. Vera celebrates her 100th birthday on March 20th, and marks the occasion by reminiscing about her early days in showbusiness, with help from her daughter Virginia. She recalls starting out as Vera Welch in the 1920s, first appearing on stage at the tender age of seven, before charming the nation's servicemen and becoming the `forces sweetheart' during the Second World War. She also remembers becoming the first British artist to achieve a number one in America in the 1950s, and a similar feat in 2009, when she became the oldest living singer to reach the same position in the UK charts. Along the way, Second World War veterans and entertainment industry figures - including Paul McCartney, Barry Humphries and Miriam Margolyes - pay tribute to the power of her voice.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In the conclusion of the two-part programme, the naturalist travels down the Baliem River's lower gorge, one of the most dangerous stretches of white water in the world surrounded by jagged rock walls.

    <desc lang="en">Documentary portrait of the US musician's life and career, during which he had two distinct periods of success. He broke onto the scene in the late 1950s, selling more than 25 million records in the space of five years, but his career as a performer took a downturn when the Beatles and the British Invasion hit the States. However he found popularity in the UK in the early 1970s, before returning to his homeland and achieving fresh stardom with famous numbers such as Solitaire and Laughter in the Rain.

    <title lang="en">The Arrival</title>
    <desc lang="en">They have been saying for years that the Greenhouse Effect is going to destroy the planet. For years humans have blamed themselves for spewing climate-changing gasses into our fragile atmosphere. But are we as guilty as we think we are or are there more sinister forces at work? Paying tribute to an old-fashioned '50s style paranoid (the aliens have come to take over the planet) sci-fi low-budget thriller, this film gives a chilling answer to that question. It begins with the scene of a young woman picking poppies in a verdant field. She is obviously puzzled and as the camera pulls away it becomes clear why. The story then jumps to a California observatory where nerdish radio telescope operator Zane Ziminski is suddenly jarred from the boredom of monitoring random space noises by a strangely regular series of unearthly blips that he is convinced come from an alien galaxy and for some reason are being deliberately beamed to Earth. Excitedly he takes the recorded evidence to his boss, who promptly fires him. Convinced that the aliens were transmitting messages to aliens already on our planet, Ziminski quickly builds a make-shift radio telescope and high tech computer system in his garage so he can pinpoit the destination of the singles. This leads him to an isolated Mexican village where he and another scientist (the lady from the poppy field), who has drawn similar conclusions, team up and go alien-hunting. They don't hunt long, for the villagers turn out to be mighty strange people. From there it is only a short time before they find the underground alien lair where they learn that the invaders' home planet is dying and that they are planning to "terraform" the Earth in preparation of colonizing it. Part of the process involves deliberately accelerating the Greenhouse effect. The special effects are well-done and refreshingly, they are not overpowering(n)</desc>

A farmer and boat-builder is visited by an angel who tells him of God's intention to send a great flood, and how he and his family will be saved from the deluge if he builds a large ark in the middle of the desert. What seems like a near-impossible task is made all the more difficult when his sons refuse to help, and as Noah continues his quest alone, he faces ridicule from both his family and the townsfolk.

    <title lang="en">E:60</title>
    <desc lang="en">Originally titled ESPN Reports, this was the cable service's effort to create a 60 Minutes-style weekly newsmagazine focusing on sports. The first episode set the tone with a piece on the "football fever" at Miami Northwestern High School, an interview with former major leaguer Cecil Fielder, a human-interest story concerning the tragically premature death of UNC Tar Heels "mascot" Jason Ray, and some musings from self-proclaimed sports psychic Dr. Bob. The individual segments were handled by such correspondents as Jeremy Schaap, Michael Smith, Rachel Nichols, Lisa Salters and Tom Ferry, while Bill Simmons, aka "The Sports Guy", appeared at the end of each episode with a few Andy Rooney-like random comments. Almost universally derided by the "legitimate" cable-news establishment, the series was generally praised by viewers as a noble effort to bring a straight-news slant to ESPN's familiar sports reportage. E:60 first aired on October 16, 2007(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Upon discovering that a psychotic serial killer has been using his writings as inspiration, legendary author Edgar Allan Poe (John Cusack) joins forces with a bright, young Baltimore detective to catch the maniac and end his reign of terror. Detective Emmett Fields (Luke Evans) was investigating a vicious murder when he realized the crime scene bore a striking resemblance to a mystery story that was just published in the local newspaper. The author of that ominous tale was Edgar Allan Poe, a brilliant young writer whose status as a social outcast catches the attention of the diligent detective. Shortly after Poe is questioned by the authorities, detectives stumble upon yet another murder scene that seems to have been inspired by the author's morbid writings. Convinced that the killer will once again use Poe's writings as a springboard to murder, Detective Fields recruits the reclusive author to help piece together a pattern to the crimes and stop the madman before he can strike again. Brendan Gleeson and Alice Eve co-star in this tense period thriller from director James McTeigue (V for Vendetta)(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Equilibrium</title>
    <desc lang="en">A man who dares to feel finds his life in danger in this cautionary science fiction drama. In the future, after a Third World War has decimated much of the Earth's population, a new nation known as Libria rises up under the unquestioned leadership of Dupont (Angus MacFadyen). Believing human emotions and their expression were to blame for the failings of past societies, The Father has decreed that all citizens must take a daily dose of Prozia II, a drug which levels out the emotional landscape, and that all forms of creative expression are against the law; violating either regulation can be punished by death. John Preston (Christian Bale) is a Grammaton, an elite law enforcement officer who tracks down and punishes "sense offenders." One day, Preston accidentally fails to take his Prozia II, and for the first time begins experiencing emotions himself. Preston becomes aware of an underground of rebels who refuse to take their medication and have embraced art and literature, and he finds himself becoming infatuated with one of their number, Mary O'Brian (Emily Watson). Equilibrium is the second feature-length directorial effort from Kurt Wimmer, whose screenwriting credits include The Thomas Crown Affair and Sphere(n)</desc>

Seen on the NBC-owned stations in the larger markets, Whacked Out Sports was initially broadcast on September 7, 2006(n)</desc>

To begin, the finalists are sent to the Holborn Dining Room, where they are tasked to prepare one course each of a three-course meal, designed by Tom Kerridge, and judged by five chefs with nine Michelin stars between them - Ashley Palmer-Watts, Michael Caines, Nathan Outlaw, Simon Rogan and Tom Kitchin.

To begin, the finalists are sent to the Holborn Dining Room, where they are tasked to prepare one course each of a three-course meal, designed by Tom Kerridge, and judged by five chefs with nine Michelin stars between them - Ashley Palmer-Watts, Michael Caines, Nathan Outlaw, Simon Rogan and Tom Kitchin. This is the amateurs' chance to show the best of the best that they have what it takes to one day join their ranks. Back in the studio, they face an invention test based around the humble chicken, and with one cook leaving at the end of the show, all four will be desperate to impress.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Heston Blumenthal discovers the origins of the British roast and serves up beef with all the trimmings to the people who make it possible - butchers and farmers. The chef tries out a roast chicken dressed as a medieval knight riding a pig into battle, and uncovers just how important beef was to Admiral Nelson and his navy. He also travels to Switzerland to find out how mould is used in laboratories to create aged meat, before preparing a joint made up of different cuts, all treated differently, and stuck together with meat glue.(n)</desc>

Lena is an orphan, and she's come to stay with her mysterious uncle, Macon Ravenwood (Irons), the patriarch of her powerful family. Powerful, because The Ravenwood clan are Casters, born with powers that ordinary mortals don't have, like the ability to move objects, control the elements, and even step out of normal space and time to communicate only with each other. But just as Lena feels ready to open up to Ethan, she discovers that their love is in imminent danger, because when female Casters turn 16, their destiny as either good or evil is revealed. Unwilling to let her nature be dictated by forces outside her control, Lena and Ethan set out together to uncover the strange, secret lore of their families' intertwined histories dating back to the Civil War, and figure out how to grant Lena the power to choose her own destiny(n)</desc>

Ham III, grandson of the first chimp in space, is a wise-cracking smart aleck who makes a living being fired from a cannon. When the Infinity Space Probe goes missing, Ham joins a mission to find it. Although he has been recruited as a PR stunt, his fellow Space Chimps are highly trained experts Luna and Titan. When the three crash-land on the planet Malgor, they find a race of aliens who are being oppressed by the tyrannical Zartog, who is using the probe for his own nefarious ends. It falls to the feckless Ham to save the day, using his circus skills to help liberate the aliens, recover the probe, get the girl, and secure passage home. This is great fare for all the family, with plenty of deadpan asides to keep grown-ups entertained. The cast also includes Stanley Tucci, and two names Glee devotees will recognise Jane Lynch and Kristin Chenoweth(n)</desc>

Jack Lemmon is John Gustafson, an ice-fishing Minnesota native who has been feuding with his neighbor and former best friend Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) for decades. The battle of wills between John and Max is characterized by crude name calling and harmless practical jokes. Max is unaware that John is having serious problems, chiefly that his daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah) is experiencing marital woes and that his house is about to be confiscated by an officious IRS agent (Buck Henry). When it seems that John and Max may finally put aside their childish rivalry, however, sexy new neighbor Ariel (Ann-Margret) arrives and dates both men, pitting them against each other more fiercely than ever before. Despite their mutual loathing, the death of a friend, John's problems, and a budding romance between Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) and Melanie may force the two old friends to reconcile(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In Washington, D.C., in the year 2054, murder has been eliminated. The future is seen and the guilty punished before the crime has ever been committed. From a nexus deep within the Justice Department's elite Precrime Unit, all the evidence to convict - from imagery alluding to the time, place and other details - is seen by Pre-Cogs, three psychic beings whose visions of murder have never been wrong. It is the nation's most advanced crime force, a perfect system. And no-one works harder for Precrime than its top man, Chief John Anderton. Destroyed by a tragic loss, Anderton has thrown all of his passion into a system that could potentially spare thousands of people from the tragedy he lived through. Six years later, the coming vote to take it national has only fuelled his conviction that Precrime works. Anderton has no reason to doubt it... until he becomes its #1 suspect(n)</desc>

Lena is an orphan, and she's come to stay with her mysterious uncle, Macon Ravenwood (Irons), the patriarch of her powerful family. Powerful, because The Ravenwood clan are Casters, born with powers that ordinary mortals don't have, like the ability to move objects, control the elements, and even step out of normal space and time to communicate only with each other. But just as Lena feels ready to open up to Ethan, she discovers that their love is in imminent danger, because when female Casters turn 16, their destiny as either good or evil is revealed. Unwilling to let her nature be dictated by forces outside her control, Lena and Ethan set out together to uncover the strange, secret lore of their families' intertwined histories dating back to the Civil War, and figure out how to grant Lena the power to choose her own destiny(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In Kirk demicco's animated film three supersonic simian spacemen take to the cosmos to find a missing probe, and encounter a whole world of trouble along the way. Ham III, grandson of the first chimp in space, is a wise-cracking smart aleck who makes a living being fired from a cannon. When the Infinity Space Probe goes missing, Ham joins a mission to find it. Although he has been recruited as a PR stunt, his fellow Space Chimps are highly trained experts Luna and Titan. When the three crash-land on the planet Malgor, they find a race of aliens who are being oppressed by the tyrannical Zartog, who is using the probe for his own nefarious ends. It falls to the feckless Ham to save the day, using his circus skills to help liberate the aliens, recover the probe, get the girl, and secure passage home.

    <desc lang="en">This cheerful holiday comedy, a surprise box office smash, featured a generous dollop of raunchy, crude humor and was greatly elevated by the presence of masterful performers in the lead roles. Jack Lemmon is John Gustafson, an ice-fishing Minnesota native who has been feuding with his neighbor and former best friend Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) for decades. The battle of wills between John and Max is characterized by crude name calling and harmless practical jokes. Max is unaware that John is having serious problems, chiefly that his daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah) is experiencing marital woes and that his house is about to be confiscated by an officious IRS agent (Buck Henry). When it seems that John and Max may finally put aside their childish rivalry, however, sexy new neighbor Ariel (Ann-Margret) arrives and dates both men, pitting them against each other more fiercely than ever before. Despite their mutual loathing, the death of a friend, John's problems, and a budding romance between Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) and Melanie may force the two old friends to reconcile(n)</desc>

From a nexus deep within the Justice Department's elite Precrime Unit, all the evidence to convict - from imagery alluding to the time, place and other details - is seen by Pre-Cogs, three psychic beings whose visions of murder have never been wrong. It is the nation's most advanced crime force, a perfect system. And no-one works harder for Precrime than its top man, Chief John Anderton. Destroyed by a tragic loss, Anderton has thrown all of his passion into a system that could potentially spare thousands of people from the tragedy he lived through. Six years later, the coming vote to take it national has only fuelled his conviction that Precrime works. Anderton has no reason to doubt it... until he becomes its #1 suspect(n)</desc>

Lena is an orphan, and she's come to stay with her mysterious uncle, Macon Ravenwood (Irons), the patriarch of her powerful family. Powerful, because The Ravenwood clan are Casters, born with powers that ordinary mortals don't have, like the ability to move objects, control the elements, and even step out of normal space and time to communicate only with each other. But just as Lena feels ready to open up to Ethan, she discovers that their love is in imminent danger, because when female Casters turn 16, their destiny as either good or evil is revealed. Unwilling to let her nature be dictated by forces outside her control, Lena and Ethan set out together to uncover the strange, secret lore of their families' intertwined histories dating back to the Civil War, and figure out how to grant Lena the power to choose her own destiny(n)</desc>

Murphy is John Dolittle, who this time around attempts to save an endangered Pacific forest from lumber industry forces by reintegrating an endangered species of bear back into the wild. Unfortunately, Dolittle's candidate is a performing bear (voice of Steve Zahn) with a taste for junk food and no natural skills in the wild. If Dolittle is going to save the species and its habitat, he must get him to mate with a fussy female (Lisa Kudrow) by providing lessons in winning the heart of the opposite sex. Dr. Dolittle's problems are compounded by a local animal work stoppage and furry woodland creatures who have organized their own version of the Mafia.

Murphy is John Dolittle, who this time around attempts to save an endangered Pacific forest from lumber industry forces by reintegrating an endangered species of bear back into the wild. Unfortunately, Dolittle's candidate is a performing bear (voice of Steve Zahn) with a taste for junk food and no natural skills in the wild. If Dolittle is going to save the species and its habitat, he must get him to mate with a fussy female (Lisa Kudrow) by providing lessons in winning the heart of the opposite sex. Dr. Dolittle's problems are compounded by a local animal work stoppage and furry woodland creatures who have organized their own version of the Mafia. Norm Macdonald returns as the voice of Lucky the Dog, co-starring with Kevin Pollak, Jeffrey Jones, Michael Rapaport, Molly Shannon, Reni Santoni, and Kristen Wilson(n)</desc>

Far removed from the rigidly regulated world of professional sports, clandestine ping pong tournaments offer thrilling competition where only the strong survive. There was a time when the mere mention of the name Randy Daytona (Dan Fogler) was enough to make even those most hardened ping pong player cower in fear, but these days Randy has fallen out of favor with ping-pong fans. The former champ soon receives a much-needed shot at redemption, however, when he is recruited by a determined FBI agent named Rodriguez (George Lopez) to win a coveted spot in the upcoming underground table tennis tournament and ferret out the nefarious Feng (Christopher Walken), whose thriving criminal empire has transformed him into a true menace to society(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Good Guy</title>
    <desc lang="en">After executive producing the acclaimed documentary Manda Bala and the J.M. Coetzee adaptation Disgrace, Julio DePietro makes his feature debut as a writer-director with The Good Guy, a drama about ambitious young Wall Streeters fighting each other -- and sometimes their own decent nature -- to get ahead in the world. Our narrator, Tommy (Scott Porter of TV's Friday Night Lights), is young, clever, charming, and attractive. He's got a smart, pretty girlfriend, Beth (Alexis Bledel of Gilmore Girls), an urban conservationist. He's also very good at his investment broker job, impressing his ruthless, cynical boss, Cash (erstwhile "Brat Pack" member Andrew McCarthy). When a key member of Tommy's sales team suddenly leaves for a competitor, Tommy needs to fill his spot quickly, and takes a chance on the bumbling Daniel (Bryan Greenberg, Bride Wars), a former Marine and computer geek who seems a bit naïve about high finance and a bit nervous around women. Tommy takes Daniel under his wing, showing him how to dress, where to socialize, and how to charm attractive women. Their relationship is threatened when Daniel begins spending more time with Beth, joining her book club, and becoming her confidant. Tommy begins to question his decision to share his wisdom with Daniel, while Daniel is forced to decide what success really means to him, and where his loyalties lie. The Good Guy also stars Anna Chlumsky (In the Loop) and Aaron Yoo (Disturbia). The film had its world premiere at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Limey</title>
    <desc lang="en">Two actors best known for their work in the late 1960s, Terence Stamp and Peter Fonda, star in The Limey, a drama in which a recently released felon contemplates the gulf between aging criminals like himself and their modern counterparts. Wilson (Stamp) is a British career criminal who has been released after nine years in prison. He has learned that his daughter Jenny died under suspicious circumstances in Los Angeles, so he travels to America for the first time to find out what happened and who's responsible. With the help of an ex-con named Ed (Luis Guzman), Wilson discovers Jenny was romantically involved with Valentine (Fonda), a middle-aged record producer with a shady past and a fondness for young women. In hopes of getting the truth -- and getting to Valentine -- Wilson finds himself doing battle with some of the worst criminals to crawl from the underbelly of Los Angeles; along the way, he also meets Elaine (Lesley Ann Warren), an older actress who knew Jenny and reminds Wilson of how little he really did for his daughter while she was alive. Steven Soderbergh's first film after his commercial comeback with 1998's Out Of Sight, The Limey features, along with Stamp and Fonda, two other notable 60's actors in supporting roles, Barry Newman and Joe Dallesandro(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Number 23</title>
    <desc lang="en">Jim Carrey and Virginia Madsen star in this dark psychological thriller from director Joel Schumacher. Walter Sparrow is leading a contented life until his wife Agatha innocently gives him a battered old paperback as a gift. As he reads, Sparrow is astonished by the parallels between his life and that of the novel's protagonist, Fingerling. But as the plot progresses it grows darker, featuring themes of transgressive sex, suicide and murder. It also hinges around Fingerling's obsession with the number 23 - a prime number that seems to pop up everywhere in the universe once you start to notice it. It's not long before 23 takes a similar hold on Sparrow. And, when he begins unjustly to view Agatha in the same distrustful light that Fingerling views his own spouse Fabrizia, it seems as if Sparrow has locked on to the same tragic trajectory as the story's lead character. Or can he find a way to wrench himself from the novel's grip?(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Sum of All Fears</title>
    <desc lang="en">The successful franchise of Paramount motion pictures based on novelist Tom Clancy's techno-thrillers featuring heroic CIA intelligence analyst Jack Ryan stages a much-publicized "do-over" with this action-adventure that recasts the character of Ryan as a rookie to the complex game of geopolitical warfare. Ben Affleck takes the reins from Harrison Ford as Ryan, a greenhorn CIA historian and analyst who finds himself thrust front and center into the spy community's spotlight when Nemerov (Ciaran Hinds), a Russian politician on whom Ryan is an expert, suddenly becomes the leader of the former Soviet Union upon the current president's unexpected demise. Attached to the director of the CIA, Cabot (Morgan Freeman), Ryan insists -- contrary to the opinions of many high-ranking White House officials -- that Nemerov is not a warmonger. Meanwhile, a cadre of neo-fascists, led by Dressler (Alan Bates), plots the detonation at the Super Bowl in Baltimore, MD, of a nuclear device recovered from a long-ago Israeli fighter jet crash, a terrorist incident they intend to spark a war between the super powers, leaving them to conquer the world in the conflict's post-apocalyptic vacuum. The Sum of All Fears co-stars James Cromwell, Bridget Moynahan, and Liev Schreiber as covert operative John Clark, a character central to another series of Clancy's best-selling tomes(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Speed 2: Cruise Control</title>
    <desc lang="en">This sequel to Speed sees Annie back and Jan de Bont directing but with Jason Patric as Alex Shaw taking over the Keanu Reeves role. The pair are an item and decide on a romantic cruise to the Caribbean. Unfortunately, also aboard the cruise liner are a gathering of diamond merchants, complete with their wares and arch-villain John Geiger, who plans to steal their merchandise. Unlike the original Speed , where the trick was that the bus would explode if it slowed down, this time, speed is of the essence - the plan is to ram the ship into dry land and, in the mayhem, escape with the loot. Bullock and Patric are perfect as the dynamic duo who save the day and the ocean-going scenario allows for more spectacular special effects than the original. Edited for language and violence(n)</desc>

Rocky III starts with the Italian Stallion so famous that his likeness is everywhere, including pinball machines. Fame and complacency soon cause Balboa to lose his title to young thug Clubber Lang (Mr. T), who inadvertently causes the death of Rocky's beloved trainer, Mickey (Burgess Meredith), before their first championship bout. After sinking into a depression, Balboa must regain the love and support of his family, as well as the elusive "eye of the tiger," the hungry need to beat the opponent which former foe Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) teaches him during this film's de rigueur training sequence. In the end, Balboa faces off against Lang for a second time. "Eye of the Tiger," the theme song Stallone commissioned from the band Survivor, became a huge hit single(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Live Six Nations Rugby Union</title>
    <sub-title lang="en">Ireland v England.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Ireland v England (Kick-off 5.00pm). Mark Pougatch presents coverage of the final match of the championship, which takes place at the Aviva Stadium. This fixture was always expected to be key when the schedule was announced, but Ireland's defeat to Wales last time out ended their chances of winning the title and handed England the spoils. However, finishing top will not be regarded as enough for coach Eddie Jones as his men seek to win the Grand Slam for the second year in succession, and the first in Six Nations history. The visitors have held the upper hand in recent meetings, winning on six of the last seven occasions, but that solitary defeat came on their last visit to Dublin in 2015. With analysis from Clive Woodward, Jonny Wilkinson and Brian O'Driscoll, pitchside reports from Martin Bayfield and Maggie Alphonsi, and commentary by Nick Mullins, Lawrence Dallaglio and Gordon D'Arcy.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Richard III: The New Evidence</title>
    <desc lang="en">Since the discovery of Richard III's remains under a car park in Leicester, scientists have been subjecting the 15th-century English king's skeleton to intense scrutiny and analysis, allowing them to reassemble his life in detail. Using the latest techniques, experts have been able to define the extent to which his spinal deformity would have affected his ability to be the warrior famed for leading the charge at the Battle of Bosworth. They have also pieced together his diet and revealed his lifestyle in his final years, with surprising results. The scientists have been helped in their investigations by a body double, 27-year-old Dominic Smee, who has the same form of scoliosis as Richard III, and this programme follows their findings.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">From enormous tortoises and deep-diving lizards to fish-eating snakes and birds that hunt giant, venomous centipedes, the wildlife of the Galapagos Islands is unique and bizarre. However, the wilderness that inspired Charles Darwin and the theory of evolution is becoming ever-more crowded due to increased migration and tourism. David Attenborough narrates this documentary, which examines how the Pacific archipelago's animals are adapting to their changing circumstances.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Scotland v Italy (Kick-off 12.30pm). Coverage of the opening match on the final day of the championship, which takes place at Murrayfield. Italy have yet to pick up a single point in the championship despite occasional signs of improvement under coach Conor O'Shea, although much of the focus will be on Scotland coach Vern Cotter as he takes charge for the final time. The New Zealander will be replaced by Gregor Townsend in June and will be looking to end his reign in style following an encouraging campaign, although he could be without several key players following their thrashing at the hands of England last weekend. Presented by Daire O'Brien, with analysis from Brent Pope, Eddie O'Sullivan and Shane Horgan, and commentary by George Hamilton and John Beattie.(n)</desc>

Wales have an excellent recent record against France, but the outcome of this match is hard to predict, with the hosts showing signs of improvement under Guy Noves despite narrow losses to England and Ireland, while Wales have performed well below the standards set in recent years. Both sides have won two and lost two of their matches and could finish anywhere between second and fifth in the standings.

    <desc lang="en">Ireland v England (Kick-off 5.00pm). Coverage of the final match of the championship, which takes place at the Aviva Stadium. This fixture was always expected to be key when the schedule was announced, but Ireland's defeat to Wales last time out ended their chances of winning the title and handed England the spoils. However, finishing top will not be regarded as enough for coach Eddie Jones as his men seek to win the Grand Slam for the second year in succession, and the first in Six Nations history. The visitors have held the upper hand in recent meetings, winning on six of the last seven occasions, but that solitary defeat came on their last visit to Dublin in 2015.

An alert warns officers to look out for a car involved in an armed robbery, and when two traffic cops spot the vehicle, they take up the surveillance trail. A driver's insurance policy seems in order - until a hunch and a fingerprint detector prove otherwise - and a woman is lucky to be alive when she overturns her car while checking her mobile.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Tyler Perry's Meet the Browns</title>
    <desc lang="en">Prolific playwright Tyler Perry adapts his popular stage play of the same name in this family-oriented comedy concerning a desperate mother who connects with the family she never knew. Brenda is a single Chicago mother of three who has been struggling for years to keep her kids off of the streets. Suddenly let go from her job with no warning to speak of, the eternally optimistic mother begins to experience a suffocating sense of hopelessness for the very first time in her life. When Brenda receives a death notice claiming that the father she has never met has passed away, she quickly gathers up the kids and sets out for Georgia to attend the funeral. Upon arriving in the Deep South, the once fretful mother is pleasantly surprised to discover that there is a whole side of the family she never knew existed. A crass but good-natured clan that welcomes Brenda and her children with open arms, the Browns' lazy summer afternoons and frequent trips to the county fair offer a much-needed contrast to the stress of surviving in inner city Chicago. Writer/director/actor Perry reprises his role as indomitable, law-breaking grandmother Madea in a comedy that proves sometimes second chances come when you least expect it(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Bank Job</title>
    <desc lang="en">Jason Statham and Saffron Burrows star in director Roger Donaldson's cinematic account of the true-life 1971 London bank robbery that baffled the authorities and fascinated the public. Terry Leather (Statham) was a small-time car dealer who was trying to leave his shady past behind and start a family. Though he'd never been involved in any major crimes, he wasn't exactly on the straight and narrow his whole life either. Martine Love (Burrows) is a beautiful model from Terry's old neighborhood who knows that her former neighbor is no angel. When Martine proposes a foolproof plan to rob a Baker Street bank, Terry recognizes the danger but realizes this may be the opportunity of a lifetime. As the operation gets underway, the resourceful band of thieves burrows its way into a safe-deposit vault at the Lloyds Bank in Marylebone, quickly hitting a literal treasure trove of cash and priceless gems. But while the crew did know that the safe-deposit boxes contained millions in riches, they didn't realize that they also contained secrets that implicated everyone from London's most notorious underworld gangsters to powerful government figures, and even the Royal Family. Though the crime would make headlines all across Britain for several days after the fact, a government gag order eventually brought all reporting on the case to an immediate halt. Could it be that the most notorious bank robbers in recent memory were actually the most innocent people involved in this scandalous crime?(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Tyler Perry's Meet the Browns</title>
    <desc lang="en">Prolific playwright Tyler Perry adapts his popular stage play of the same name in this family-oriented comedy concerning a desperate mother who connects with the family she never knew. Brenda is a single Chicago mother of three who has been struggling for years to keep her kids off of the streets. Suddenly let go from her job with no warning to speak of, the eternally optimistic mother begins to experience a suffocating sense of hopelessness for the very first time in her life. When Brenda receives a death notice claiming that the father she has never met has passed away, she quickly gathers up the kids and sets out for Georgia to attend the funeral. Upon arriving in the Deep South, the once fretful mother is pleasantly surprised to discover that there is a whole side of the family she never knew existed. A crass but good-natured clan that welcomes Brenda and her children with open arms, the Browns' lazy summer afternoons and frequent trips to the county fair offer a much-needed contrast to the stress of surviving in inner city Chicago. Writer/director/actor Perry reprises his role as indomitable, law-breaking grandmother Madea in a comedy that proves sometimes second chances come when you least expect it(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Bank Job</title>
    <desc lang="en">Jason Statham and Saffron Burrows star in director Roger Donaldson's cinematic account of the true-life 1971 London bank robbery that baffled the authorities and fascinated the public. Terry Leather (Statham) was a small-time car dealer who was trying to leave his shady past behind and start a family. Though he'd never been involved in any major crimes, he wasn't exactly on the straight and narrow his whole life either. Martine Love (Burrows) is a beautiful model from Terry's old neighborhood who knows that her former neighbor is no angel. When Martine proposes a foolproof plan to rob a Baker Street bank, Terry recognizes the danger but realizes this may be the opportunity of a lifetime. As the operation gets underway, the resourceful band of thieves burrows its way into a safe-deposit vault at the Lloyds Bank in Marylebone, quickly hitting a literal treasure trove of cash and priceless gems. But while the crew did know that the safe-deposit boxes contained millions in riches, they didn't realize that they also contained secrets that implicated everyone from London's most notorious underworld gangsters to powerful government figures, and even the Royal Family. Though the crime would make headlines all across Britain for several days after the fact, a government gag order eventually brought all reporting on the case to an immediate halt. Could it be that the most notorious bank robbers in recent memory were actually the most innocent people involved in this scandalous crime?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Directed by Atom Egoyan, Felicia's Journey is a low-key psychological thriller about the relationship between a lovesick young woman and an older man with an ugly secret. Felicia (Elaine Cassidy) has lived all of her life in a small village in rural Ireland. She has fallen in love with a boy named Johnny (Peter McDonald), so when Johnny unexpectedly travels to England in search of a job, Felicia wants to follow him -- especially since she's pregnant, a fact that she's keeping secret from her family, as well as Johnny. However, Johnny's family refuses to give her his address, so she leaves for Birmingham with only a sketchy idea of his whereabouts. Shortly after arriving, Felicia encounters Joseph Ambrose Hilditch (Bob Hoskins), the meticulous manager of a catering concern. She needs a place to stay and he recommends a good bed-and-breakfast. They soon become friendly, but Hilditch is more than just a mildly eccentric middle-aged man with a taste for French cuisine: he's had a long history of using and abusing homeless women, and Felicia looks like she's doomed to be the next victim. Based on a novel by William Trevor, Felicia's Journey was shown in competition at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival(n)</desc>

As the evening's questionable activities take a decidedly sordid slant and the raptorial Jeff appears poised to strike, a sudden turn of events finds that his apparent victim has had a plan of her own from the very beginning(n)</desc>

Upon discovering a bullet-strewn pickup truck surrounded by the corpses of dead bodyguards, Moss uncovers two million dollars in cash and a substantial load of heroin stashed in the back of the vehicle.

When the corpse of the man ghost-writing the memoirs of former British Prime Minister Adam Lang is found, apparently having accidentally fallen from a ferry, another writer is quickly hired to finish the job. The new man is dispatched to the ex-PM's swish home in the States. As the writer begins his task, he's frustrated that he's not allowed completely free access to his predecessor's draft but gets on with the work, under pressure from all sides to finish the job quickly. But, later, he uncovers documents, seemingly left by the dead man, which throw a new light on everything: they suggest Lang and his wealthy friends have very dark secrets that they'd kill for. Will the new ghost-writer now suffer the same fate as the previous one? Also starring Olivia Williams, Tom Wilkinson and Kim Cattrall(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Set in Victorian London, Tanya Wexler's period comedy Hysteria tells the tale of Mortimer Granville (Hugh Dancy), a young doctor disturbed by the way most hospitals ignore the latest research on germ theory, and still treat patients with bleedings and leeches. After being fired from his most recent job for speaking out on the matter, he ends up in the employ of Dr. Robert Dalrymple (Jonathan Pryce) who runs a private practice specializing in treating women who suffer from "hysteria" and come to the doctor for his precise digital manipulations in order to get a release. With the help of Mortimer's best friend Edmund (Rupert Everett) together they create a device that allows these women to achieve the desired result much more quickly. Complicating matters, Mortimer becomes enamored of Dalrymple's strong-willed, feminist-minded daughter Charlotte (Maggie Gyllenhaal).

    <desc lang="en">Inspired by authors Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner wildly popular best-seller Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything, this documentary teams such acclaimed filmmakers as Morgan Spurlock (Super Size Me), Alex Gibney (Taxi to the Dark Side), and Seth Gordon (The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters) to look at human behavior from a perspective of incentives and statistics. Conventional wisdom gets caught in the crosshairs when Jesus Camp co-directors Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady explore how underachieving kids respond when they're rewarded for hard work with greenbacks; Gibney throws open the curtain on sumo wrestling; Spurlock examines how baby names can affect a child's development; and Why We Fight director Eugene Jarecki offers a troubling hypothesis on why the early-'90s saw some of the lowest crime rates of the latter 20th century(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">How Stella Got Her Groove Back</title>
    <desc lang="en">Terry McMillan and Ron Bass wrote this screenplay based on McMillan's semi-autobiographical best-selling novel (over 2,000,000 copies in print before the release of this film). San Francisco stockbroker Stella (Angela Bassett), a 40-year-old divorcee, has a nice Marin County home and an 11-year-old son, Quincy (Michael J. Pagan). With Quincy off to see his dad, Stella and her best friend Delilah (Whoopi Goldberg) vacation in Jamaica, where she meets sexy, good-looking Winston Shakespeare (Taye Diggs). He's the man of her dreams in every way except one -- he's half her age. Even so, a romance develops. Grammy Award-winning songwriters Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis supervised the film's music and produced the R&amp;B-slanted soundtrack album. Shown at the 1998 Urbanworld Film Festival (NY)(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Friday After Next</title>
    <desc lang="en">The gang from Friday and Next Friday are back in this urban comedy, in which Craig (Ice Cube) and Day-Day (Mike Epps) have finally moved out of their respective parents' homes and gotten an apartment together. However, a bogus neighborhood Santa Claus (Rickey Smiley) decides to help Craig and Day-Day share the wealth by robbing their apartment, and when he rips off their stereo, he also makes off with their rent money, which was hidden in the speaker cabinets. Desperate to make rent and have some money for Christmas presents, Craig and Day-Day land jobs at a local strip mall, where their fathers, Mr. Jones (John Witherspoon) and Uncle Elroy (Don "D.C." Curry), have gone into business together running a barbecue joint. Craig and Day-Day are installed as security guards, and while Craig tries to make time with Donna (K.D. Aubert), a saleswoman at the Pimp N' Ho's Boutique, and keep things orderly at Holy Moly's Doughnut Shop, Day-Day attempts to transform himself into a master of crime-fighting, which causes a lot more problems than it solves. Friday After Next is the first feature film from director Marcus Raboy, who previously directed music videos for Sting, Li'l Kim, Staind, and Friday After Next star Ice Cube(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Gruesome horror sequel in which a leprechaun travels to Los Angeles from Ireland in search of his bride, a descendant of a woman he was unable to marry long ago, with vengeance being his top priority. A thousand years ago in Ancient Erin, there lived a wee Leprechaun who searched for a comely bride. Legend has it that his proper bride would thrice sneeze. Poor Leprechaun did find his sneezing lass, but just before the third achoo, her daddy, the Leprechaun's slave, thwarts his plans. Angry, the wee man vows to exact his revenge upon the man's fairest ancestor 1,000 years hence. Time flies and the movie moves to modern California on St. Paddy's day. The Leprechaun returns to find the lovely Bridget sneezing. Once. Twice. Thrice. He captures hapless Colleen. To her rescue comes her fearless boyfriend Cody who steals a bit of gold from the Leprechaun. Enraged, the greedy greeny begins systematically killing people. Will Cody prevail?(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Twilight Zone</title>
    <sub-title lang="en">Piano in the House</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Piano in the House. An atypical Twilight Zone entry from scriptwriter Earl Hamner, Jr., this episode stars Barry Morse as theatrical critic Fitzgerald Fortune, whose snide cynicism is matched only by his sadistic streak. While seeking out a birthday present for his young wife Esther (Joan Hackett), Fortune happens upon an old player piano, which, when activated, forces the people in its vicinity to reveal their true feelings. Wickedly amused by this, Fortune utilizes the piano at his wife's birthday party, resulting in a deluge of hidden emotions -- and, ultimately, disaster for Fortune himself. Not one of the better Twilight Zone episodes, this one benefits immensely from a stellar supporting cast, including Muriel Landers and Cyril Delevanti. Directed by future Hill Street Blues stalwart David Greene, "A Piano in the House" first aired February 16, 1962(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Replacements</title>
    <desc lang="en">The 1987 National Football League players' strike inspired this sports-themed comedy. The Washington Sentinels are one of the strongest teams in pro football -- until contract negotiations break down and the Sentinels go on strike. Determined to play the team's schedule, owner Edward O'Neil (Jack Warden) recruits a ragtag band of scab players, to be headed up and whipped into shape by the retired veteran coach Jimmy McGinty (Gene Hackman). At the top of the recruitment list is quarterback Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves), a promising athlete until a catastrophic defeat in the Sugar Bowl dashed his confidence.

Translation: if blood continues to bubble in the Big Apple, so will the creativity of the series writers. And on the evidence of this week's double bill of episodes, screening on two consecutive nights, there's not a smidgen of staleness about the storylines.

Cutter (Linus Roache) appears to tip the scales of justice in his favour by playing up Rubirosa's (Alana de la Garza) attractiveness to an enamoured juror. Meanwhile, Betrayal sees a woman act as her own counsel amid accusations that she shot dead her therapist husband over his inappropriate relationship with a teenage client(n)</desc>
