    <desc lang="en">Animated adaptation of Michael Morpurgo's children's book, a magical reworking of the Nativity. One Christmas night, an elderly shepherd tells his grandchildren the story of how, when he was their age, he came to be the first visitor to the infant Jesus Christ.

Disappointed, he shouts to the heavens - and is shocked when the angel returns. But that is just the beginning of his adventure. With the voices of Michael Gambon, Juliet Stevenson, Dominic Cooper and Colin McFarlane.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Morecambe and Wise Story: Look Back in Laughter</title>
    <desc lang="en">Documentary making use of old performances, chat-show appearances and archive interviews to shed light on the success of Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise. The film explores the pair's working-class roots in the north of England, and their early encounters. Eric's mother Sadie claimed to be the first person to spot their potential as a comedy double-act when, as children, they spent an entire train journey to Coventry annoying her with their antics. The Second World War would see the duo split up, but they were reunited by chance, and by 1968 they had become established household names, and were on track to become the most-watched comedy act in the history of British TV.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">First-time screenwriter Stelios Pavlou enjoyed a major success with this script that he wrote while working in an English liquor store by sending it to actor Samuel L. Jackson, who signed on for one of the lead roles. Jackson is Elmo McElroy, a kilt-wearing, golf club-wielding Los Angeles native who has invented an illegal drug formula that he hopes will provide him with a last major score of 20 million dollars before he retires from a life of crime. He travels to Liverpool, England, where he hopes to find a buyer for his creation among the denizens of the city's rave scene, but his plans go awry when those who are in on the deal start turning up dead. Elmo's only protector is a chain-smoking, Yank-hating local hood named Felix De Souza (Robert Carlyle), who reluctantly partners with the violence-prone American to finish the deal and cash in, sparking a gang war between Elmo's vengeful one-time employer, The Lizard (Meat Loaf); Felix's boss, Durant (Ricky Tomlinson); crooked cop Virgil Kane (Sean Pertwee); a beautiful assassin, who also happens to be Felix's ex-girlfriend (Emily Mortimer); and an offbeat, yoga-practicing nightclub owner and mobster named Iki (Rhys Ifans). For its U.S. release, the title of The 51st State was changed to Formula 51(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Speed Racer</title>
    <desc lang="en">The Matrix masterminds Andy and Larry Wachowski usher anime icon Tatsuo Yoshida's classic 1960s-era hit into the new millennium with this family-friendly story of a young racecar driver who takes on the mysterious Racer X in a custom-made, gadget-loaded speed machine named the Mach 5 . Speed Racer (Emile Hirsch) is the kind of driver that every wheelman wishes he could be: a born winner whose unbeatable combination of aggression, instinct, and fearlessness always finds him crossing the checkered flag with a comfortable lead. In Speed Racer's mind, the only driver who could present him with any real challenge is his late brother -- the legendary Rex Racer. Rex died in a heated cross-country rally known as The Crucible many years ago, and now his younger sibling is driven to fulfill the legacy that Rex left behind. To this day, Speed Racer is fiercely loyal to family. It was Speed Racer's father, Pops Racer (John Goodman), who designed the unbeatable Mach 5 , and even a lucrative offer from racing giants Royalton Industries isn't enough to get the young ace to break his family ties. Upon turning down Royalton's (Roger Allam) astronomical offer, Speed Racer makes the shocking discovery that the outcomes of the biggest races are being predetermined by a handful of powerful moguls who pad their profits by manipulating the drivers. Realizing that his career would be ruined if word of the fix gets out, Royalton vows that the Mach 5 will never make it to another finish line. Now, the only way for Speed Racer to save the family business and beat Royalton at his own game will be to win the very same race that claimed his brother's life so many years ago. In order to accomplish that formidable feat, however, Speed Racer will not only have to rely on his family and the aid of his longtime girlfriend, Trixie (Christina Ricci), but form a tenuous alliance with his longtime rival -- the mysterious Racer X (Matthew Fox) -- as well(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Speed Racer</title>
    <desc lang="en">The Matrix masterminds Andy and Larry Wachowski usher anime icon Tatsuo Yoshida's classic 1960s-era hit into the new millennium with this family-friendly story of a young racecar driver who takes on the mysterious Racer X in a custom-made, gadget-loaded speed machine named the Mach 5 . Speed Racer (Emile Hirsch) is the kind of driver that every wheelman wishes he could be: a born winner whose unbeatable combination of aggression, instinct, and fearlessness always finds him crossing the checkered flag with a comfortable lead. In Speed Racer's mind, the only driver who could present him with any real challenge is his late brother -- the legendary Rex Racer. Rex died in a heated cross-country rally known as The Crucible many years ago, and now his younger sibling is driven to fulfill the legacy that Rex left behind. To this day, Speed Racer is fiercely loyal to family. It was Speed Racer's father, Pops Racer (John Goodman), who designed the unbeatable Mach 5 , and even a lucrative offer from racing giants Royalton Industries isn't enough to get the young ace to break his family ties. Upon turning down Royalton's (Roger Allam) astronomical offer, Speed Racer makes the shocking discovery that the outcomes of the biggest races are being predetermined by a handful of powerful moguls who pad their profits by manipulating the drivers. Realizing that his career would be ruined if word of the fix gets out, Royalton vows that the Mach 5 will never make it to another finish line. Now, the only way for Speed Racer to save the family business and beat Royalton at his own game will be to win the very same race that claimed his brother's life so many years ago. In order to accomplish that formidable feat, however, Speed Racer will not only have to rely on his family and the aid of his longtime girlfriend, Trixie (Christina Ricci), but form a tenuous alliance with his longtime rival -- the mysterious Racer X (Matthew Fox) -- as well(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Bruce Almighty</title>
    <desc lang="en">Six years since they worked together on Liar Liar, and nearly a decade after Ace Ventura: Pet Detective placed them on the Hollywood A-list, director Tom Shadyac and Jim Carrey re-team once again for this high-concept fantasy comedy, the first film for both since making the non-comedic missteps Dragonfly and The Majestic, respectively. Carrey stars as television reporter Bruce Nolan. Despite his status as a well-liked minor celebrity and the unconditional love of his beautiful girlfriend, Grace (Jennifer Aniston), Bruce can't seem to shake his dissatisfaction with the shortfalls of his everyday life. After an exceptionally misfortune-filled day, Bruce turns to the sky and lays into God, accusing Him of doing a poor job of running things on Earth. Bruce is so vehement that God (Morgan Freeman) transports Bruce to his office and makes him a once-in-a-lifetime offer. If Bruce thinks He is so inadequate, God tells him that he'll bestow omnipotence upon Bruce for 24 hours. However, if by the end of that period of time Bruce is unsuccessful in his attempts to make the world a better place, as a consequence, God will inflict a cataclysm upon Earth that will revert things back to the Dark Ages. Written by Steve Koren and Mark O'Keefe, Bruce Almighty features supporting performances by Steve Carrell, Philip Baker Hall, and Eddie Jemison(n)</desc>

The trial of Walker is shown through exclusive footage. After the conviction, American Justice follows her through her daily life, showing her prison surroundings and talking with her about her crimes. Sentenced to death, while Walker was waiting to be executed, she became a born-again Christian. Her lawyers used this transformation as leverage to try to get her death sentence reduced to life in prison. Their attempts were unsuccessful and Walker was killed by lethal injection in February 1998. American Justice also shows interviews with lawyers and law enforcement professionals who knew Walker(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The trio of motoring enthusiasts embark on another epic road trip, this time across western America in front-engined supercars. Jeremy Clarkson pilots the Lexus LFA, which has a spectacularly high-revving V10 powerplant, Richard Hammond gets behind the wheel of the muscular Dodge Viper, and James May opts for the latest incarnation of Aston Martin's Vanquish. On their journey from Las Vegas to Palm Springs via Los Angeles, the presenters tackle racing circuits and find themselves in a race against the police, before rushing to the Mexican border - and there's a terrifying penalty for the last man to arrive. Meanwhile, Fleetwood Mac drummer Mick Fleetwood rolls up his sleeves to thrash the Reasonably Priced Car.(n)</desc>

The trio believe they can do a better job than explorers who claim to have discovered the waterway's starting point by travelling further and faster than previous efforts - but the only tools at their disposal are determination, ingenuity and three ageing estate cars.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Top Gear</title>
    <desc lang="en">The trio of motoring enthusiasts embark on another epic road trip, this time across western America in front-engined supercars. Jeremy Clarkson pilots the Lexus LFA, which has a spectacularly high-revving V10 powerplant, Richard Hammond gets behind the wheel of the muscular Dodge Viper, and James May opts for the latest incarnation of Aston Martin's Vanquish. On their journey from Las Vegas to Palm Springs via Los Angeles, the presenters tackle racing circuits and find themselves in a race against the police, before rushing to the Mexican border - and there's a terrifying penalty for the last man to arrive. Meanwhile, Fleetwood Mac drummer Mick Fleetwood rolls up his sleeves to thrash the Reasonably Priced Car.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">First Steps.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Naturalist David Attenborough documents the universal tale that unites humanity with every other animal on the planet - the journey through life, and the goal to continue the bloodline through offspring. This edition focuses on the first hurdle any animal will face, surviving infancy. Cameras follow flightless barnacle goose chicks as they strive to find food, leaping 400ft down a cliff from the ledge where they hatched. Meanwhile, in New Zealand, young fur seals have stumbled across a safe haven in which they can learn how to avoid predators, while deep in the Gobi Desert, the long-eared jerboa learns to use its impeccable hearing to catch insect pray. Plus, albatross chicks make their first flight, as threatening tiger sharks wait patiently for them to slip up and land in the sea.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Home.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The importance of homes to animals, not only as a place to live but as a shelter from the elements and a refuge from enemies. A pack of African hunting dogs have made their home on a vast plain in Zambia, but it's far from safe as they must battle hyenas and protect their young. Hermit crabs on a tropical island settle down in empty snail shells - and when a new property washes ashore, they all form a queue, then move up the housing chain until all the shells are taken. On the edge of the Sahara are chimpanzees, whose survival relies on knowing where to find water in the most extreme droughts. Here the elders lead a troop on a brutal trek to a dried-out riverbed to dig wells.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Power.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The importance of power in the animal kingdom, revealing how dominant creatures have the best access to food and water, and are also the most attractive to the opposite sex. An orphaned young chimp tries to climb the social ladder, but his troop is ruled by big, aggressive males and his first attempt to join them ends in a beating. A meerkat society will only allow newcomers in if they know how to deal with a venomous snake. And the only way to occupy the top spot in a meadow of kangaroos is to beat the ruling male in a boxing match - but few have challenged the current incumbent, who stands at 8ft. Will any animal dare take him on? David Attenborough narrates.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Courtship.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">David Attenborough reveals how the competition to breed creates scenes of the most extraordinary beauty, as well as some of the most violent battles seen in nature. A male flame bowerbird shows off its artistic prowess to impress a potential mate - but if that does not prove enough, it will demonstrate its dancing skills instead. Waved albatrosses pair up for life and spend hours in each other's company, although things are not so simple for a male peacock jumping spider - one wrong move in its dazzling courtship routine could prove fatal. However, one of the most magnificent displays of all is created by a tiny male pufferfish, which impresses the ladies by building a spectacular underwater `crop circle' in the sand - arguably the most perfect and complex structure created by any animal.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">David Attenborough's documentary charting the circle of life in the animal kingdom ends with creatures' attempts to rear their offspring, revealing the commitment involved and how for some parents it means risking their own lives. A turtle hauls itself up the beach to lay its eggs in a safe place, only for the tide to trap it behind a wall of coral. A mother bonobo in the Congo teaches its son the skills it will need to survive adulthood, bison protect their calves from the ever-present threat of wolves and a mother zebra has to lead its foal across a dangerous river. Last in the series.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Power.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The importance of power in the animal kingdom, revealing how dominant creatures have the best access to food and water, and are also the most attractive to the opposite sex. An orphaned young chimp tries to climb the social ladder, but his troop is ruled by big, aggressive males and his first attempt to join them ends in a beating. A meerkat society will only allow newcomers in if they know how to deal with a venomous snake. And the only way to occupy the top spot in a meadow of kangaroos is to beat the ruling male in a boxing match - but few have challenged the current incumbent, who stands at 8ft. Will any animal dare take him on? David Attenborough narrates.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Courtship.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">David Attenborough reveals how the competition to breed creates scenes of the most extraordinary beauty, as well as some of the most violent battles seen in nature. A male flame bowerbird shows off its artistic prowess to impress a potential mate - but if that does not prove enough, it will demonstrate its dancing skills instead. Waved albatrosses pair up for life and spend hours in each other's company, although things are not so simple for a male peacock jumping spider - one wrong move in its dazzling courtship routine could prove fatal. However, one of the most magnificent displays of all is created by a tiny male pufferfish, which impresses the ladies by building a spectacular underwater `crop circle' in the sand - arguably the most perfect and complex structure created by any animal.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Parenthood.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">David Attenborough's documentary charting the circle of life in the animal kingdom ends with creatures' attempts to rear their offspring, revealing the commitment involved and how for some parents it means risking their own lives. A turtle hauls itself up the beach to lay its eggs in a safe place, only for the tide to trap it behind a wall of coral. A mother bonobo in the Congo teaches its son the skills it will need to survive adulthood, bison protect their calves from the ever-present threat of wolves and a mother zebra has to lead its foal across a dangerous river. Last in the series.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">First Steps.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Naturalist David Attenborough documents the universal tale that unites humanity with every other animal on the planet - the journey through life, and the goal to continue the bloodline through offspring. This edition focuses on the first hurdle any animal will face, surviving infancy. Cameras follow flightless barnacle goose chicks as they strive to find food, leaping 400ft down a cliff from the ledge where they hatched. Meanwhile, in New Zealand, young fur seals have stumbled across a safe haven in which they can learn how to avoid predators, while deep in the Gobi Desert, the long-eared jerboa learns to use its impeccable hearing to catch insect pray. Plus, albatross chicks make their first flight, as threatening tiger sharks wait patiently for them to slip up and land in the sea.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Hanging Up</title>
    <desc lang="en">Diane Keaton directed and starred in this comedy/drama about a family brought together by potential tragedy. In her mid-40s, Eve (Meg Ryan) minds her house, runs a business organizing parties and events for others, and looks after her father (Walter Matthau), an alcoholic former writer who has grown argumentative and increasingly difficult to handle. Eve's sisters -- Georgia (Keaton), who is a few years older and the editor of a successful fashion magazine, and Maddy (Lisa Kudrow), a few years younger and a working actress with a spot on a soap opera -- have also had to deal with Dad, but only by long distance when he makes one of his frequent telephone calls. Dad now doesn't have long to live, and the siblings must pull together and make peace with their father and each other. Sisters Nora Ephron and Delia Ephron adapted the screenplay from Delia's novel; the supporting cast includes Adam Arkin, Cloris Leachman, and Mary Steenburgen(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Machine Gun Preacher</title>
    <desc lang="en">Gerard Butler stars in Marc Forster's violent, fact-based drama about a substance-addicted criminal who finds God and relocates to Sudan to offer his own idiosyncratic brand of Christian charity. The film initially portrays Sam Childers as being a far from nice man: a misogynistic biker whose life is steeped in crime, narcotics and violence, and who quickly returns to armed robbery almost as soon as he's released from jail. But while he was inside, his wife Lynn found Jesus, and, after Sam gets stabbed, she urges him to join her at church. Sam subsequently has his own Damascene moment and starts life afresh, founding his own (legitimate) construction company. Before long he has also built his own church. But it's only after a trip to Sudan, where he witnesses the devastation wrought by the marauding Lord's Resistance Army, that he truly becomes driven. Relocating to the African country, he sets up a faith-based centre to care for victims of the LRA's violence and rape. And also takes up arms to literally fight the good fight... Also starring Michael Shannon(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Sniper</title>
    <desc lang="en">In this taut jungle melodrama it is difficult to tell the hunters from the hunted. It is set within the heavy Panamanian jungles and centers upon two Marine Corps marksmen who have been assigned to assassinate a Colombian drug czar. Tom Beckett is the senior corpsman who has killed over 70 people, none of them accidentally. He enjoys his job and prides himself on his care to never hit the innocent. His former partner was Corporal Papich who was unfortunately killed on the last mission. Papich's replacement is the eager-beaver rookie Richard Miller who has won an Olympic Medal for his shooting. Although not a military man, Miller has connections with the National Security Council that assigns these missions and is now eager to prove himself, especially after the Council placed the novice in charge of the mission and considers the more experienced Beckett expendable. Naturally there is tension between the two disparate killers, especially after Miller demonstrates his ineptitude under pressure. Before they can kill the drug lord, they must first ingratiate themselves with the local Indians. To do so, the loner Beckett agrees to deviate from his orders and murder the cruel ex-CIA operative El Cirujano who has been torturing the locals. Unfortunately, Miller makes the shot and botches the job. The locals then refuse to help and tension between the men escalates. When El Cirujano captures Beckett, Miller must somehow get his act together, save Beckett, and fulfil his mission(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This daily show-biz gossip and "expose" series was a spinoff of the popular interactive website TMZ, an acronym for the "Thirty Mile Zone" surrounding Hollywood. Created in 2005, TMZ had gained national prominence by breaking the story of Mel Gibson's anti-Semitic tirade after his arrest for drunken driving. By the time the TV version of TMZ premiered the week of September 10, 2007, the operation had once again scooped its scandal-rag competition with its coverage of O.J. Simpson's profanity-laden "invasion" of the home of a collectibles dealer who was allegedly selling Simpson memorabilia without permission. In fact, TMZ on TV had a wealth of celebrity-meltdown yarns to choose from during its shakedown week, ranging from the substance-abuse problems of Lindsay Lohan to the ill-fated "comeback" concert of Britney Spears. Harvey Levin, managing editor for both versions of TMZ, appeared on-camera as a correspondent, along with Sean Borg, Michael Hundgen, Katie Darryl and Teresa Strasser.

    <desc lang="en">Eight years after getting a crash course in the fine art of personifying Christmas, Tim Allen returns as Kris Kringle's replacement in this sequel to the 1994 hit The Santa Clause. While Scott Calvin (Allen) initially had mixed feelings when he became the new Santa Claus, after eight years on the job he's come to enjoy being Father Christmas, and he and the Elves are looking forward to another holiday season when things begin going a bit wrong. Scott finds he's becoming less and less "Santa-like," and his son Charlie (Eric Lloyd) has become difficult enough to land on the official "Naughty" list. Scott discovers most of his problems stem from an obscure passage in his contract with the North Pole which decrees that he has to find a Mrs. Claus. Scott has little choice but to start dating, but he soon learns that when you're a big guy from the North Pole who lacks conventional employment, single women do not come running. In order to leave him more time to search for a wife, Scott and the Elves create a duplicate Santa to keep an eye on the shop; however, the "other" Santa turns out to be more Naughty than Nice, and in time Scott has to wrestle control of the North Pole away from his doppelganger.

    <desc lang="en">Nigella Lawson travels to Venice to soak up the atmosphere and gain inspiration for dishes for a Christmas party with an Italian twist. Back in the UK, she creates a tasty buffet menu for her guests, preparing a Venetian cocktail served with quick and easy canapes including Parmesan shortbreads and panettone stuffing squares. Nigella's take on the traditional roast bird is turkey breast stuffed with Italian sausage and marsala-steeped cranberries, served with salad and Brussels sprout pasta. Guests are treated to desserts including a marshmallow cappuccino pavlova and a Christmas pudding cake adorned with chocolate chips and pomegranate seeds.(n)</desc>

Rowling. Rumor has it that the dreaded Lord Voldemort has returned, but Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy) isn't so sure what to make of all the hearsay currently floating around the campus of Hogwarts. Suspecting that Headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) may be fueling the rumors regarding Voldemort's return in order to undermine his authority and lay claim to his job, Fudge entrusts newly arrived Defense Against the Dark Arts professor Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) with the task of tracking Dumbledore and keeping a protective watch over the nervous student body. The young wizards of Hogwarts will need something much more effective than Umbridge's Ministry-approved course in defensive magic if they are to truly succeed in the extraordinary battle that lies ahead, however, and when the administration fails to provide the students with the tools that they will need to defend Hogwarts against the fearsome powers of the Dark Arts, Hermione (Emma Watson), Ron (Rupert Grint), and Harry take it upon themselves to recruit a small group of students to form "Dumbledore's Army" in preparation for the ultimate supernatural showdown(n)</desc>

Rowling. Rumor has it that the dreaded Lord Voldemort has returned, but Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy) isn't so sure what to make of all the hearsay currently floating around the campus of Hogwarts. Suspecting that Headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) may be fueling the rumors regarding Voldemort's return in order to undermine his authority and lay claim to his job, Fudge entrusts newly arrived Defense Against the Dark Arts professor Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) with the task of tracking Dumbledore and keeping a protective watch over the nervous student body. The young wizards of Hogwarts will need something much more effective than Umbridge's Ministry-approved course in defensive magic if they are to truly succeed in the extraordinary battle that lies ahead, however, and when the administration fails to provide the students with the tools that they will need to defend Hogwarts against the fearsome powers of the Dark Arts, Hermione (Emma Watson), Ron (Rupert Grint), and Harry take it upon themselves to recruit a small group of students to form "Dumbledore's Army" in preparation for the ultimate supernatural showdown(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Set 100 miles south of the setting of the Polish brothers' first feature, Twin Falls Idaho, Jackpot tells the story of Sunny Holiday Jon Gries, a down-on-his-luck karaoke dweller who has hopes of becoming a country singer. He has abandoned his feisty wife Bobbi (Daryl Hannah) and young daughter to set off on a nine-month road odyssey with his manager Lester Irving (Garrett Morris), in an effort to collect cash at local karaoke gigs. Lester grooms Sunny by choosing what songs he will do, keeping up with what the judges are like, and negotiating with competitors like Sammy Bones (Mac Davis), another traveling hopeful. On his road journey, he encounters several women, including Janice (Peggy Lipton), a club waitress, and Cheryl (Crystal Bernard), whom he takes home after she has an accident in a restroom, only to find himself being enticed by her underage daughter Tangerine (Camellia Clouse). The road trip comes to a stop, however, when Sunny is pulled over by police who claim that his vehicle is stolen and that Bobbi has reported it. Sunny then seeks refuge with brother Tracy (Anthony Edwards) while he decides his next move. Jackpot is the first released film to be shot with the 24P HDTV camera, which was then blown up to Cinemascope 35 mm format(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Comedian Jerry Lewis began directing movies in 1960, and this often unkind satire on the nature of American womanhood is one of his early efforts in that regard. The rubber-legged, rubber-faced Lewis plays Herbert, a man who is despondent over the break-up of his romance. While looking for a job, he comes across an impressive mansion (built as a set at the cost of $350,000) filled with women of all types -- and lo and behold -- they need a handyman. So Herbert gets to reside with a bevy of women of various types, all under the supervision of Mrs. Wellenmelon (Helen Traubel). In the end, the set itself outtrumps them all(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">I Now Pronounce You Chuck &amp; Larry</title>
    <desc lang="en">When two testosterone-fueled firemen attempt to register as domestic partners in order to bypass the bureaucratic red tape preventing one of them from naming his own two children as his life-insurance beneficiaries, their low-key ruse turns into headline news in this quirky matrimonial comedy starring Adam Sandler and Kevin James. Chuck Levine (Sandler) and Larry Valentine (James) are two New York City firefighters whose longtime friendship has endured many a five-alarm fire. All that widower Larry wants is to ensure that his two children will be taken care of if anything should happen to him on the job, and all that single blaze-battler Chuck wants is to carry on with his carefree life of noncommitment. Having once rescued Larry from certain death in a particularly fearsome inferno, beholden Chuck feels forever indebted to his brave friend and has vowed to repay the favor when the time is right. When Larry discovers that the only means of circumventing the civic red tape that could throw his children's futures into jeopardy is to take Chuck as his lawfully wedded husband, his obligated pal reluctantly agrees to step up to the alter with the understanding that the arrangement will be a well-kept secret between themselves and the justice of the peace. A potentially fatal flaw in their presumably foolproof plan is soon revealed, however, when an overzealous bureaucrat decides to question Chuck and Larry's partnership. Subsequently forced to embark on a mandatory honeymoon and pose as starry-eyed newlyweds, Chuck and Larry quickly discover just how important it can be to stick by a friend in his or her time of need. Jessica Biel, Steve Buscemi, Ving Rhames, and Dan Aykroyd co-star in a comedy from The Benchwarmers director Dennis Dugan(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Racing Stripes</title>
    <desc lang="en">A horse of a different pattern becomes a spoiler in a high-stakes race in the family-friendly comedy-drama. Nolan Walsh (Bruce Greenwood) is a farmer who once earned his living training racehorses before his wife was killed in an accident while riding, which led him to leave the racing game. Nolan tends to his farm and looks after his daughter Channing (Hayden Panettiere) and a large flock of animals, who speak to one another but not to humans. After a traveling circus passes through town, a zebra pony is left behind; Nolan takes in the animal, intending to return it to the circus, but at Channing's insistence they keep the zebra, naming him Stripes (voiced by Frankie Muniz). Channing loves Stripes, and the zebra is welcomed by the other critters on the farm, including grumpy Shetland pony Tucker (voiced by Dustin Hoffman), slow-moving hound dog Lightning (voiced by Snoop Dogg), a New Jersey-born pelican named Goose (voiced by Joe Pantoliano), skinny-brained rooster Reggie (voiced by Jeff Foxworthy), and deep-thinking goat Franny (voiced by Whoopi Goldberg). Channing discovers that Stripes can outrun nearly any horse around, and Woodzie (M. Emmett Walsh), a local character who has spent years handicapping the ponies, is convinced the zebra would be shoo-in in the Kentucky Open, a prestigious race held at the estate of champion horse breeder Clara Dalrymple (Wendie Malick). Channing believes Stripes can win, but he'll need the help of Nolan, who isn't so sure he's ready to start training again; meanwhile, Stripes gets plenty of advice from the other farm animals about his big step onto the race track. Mandy Moore, David Spade, and Steve Harvey also contribute their voice talents to the picture(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">I Now Pronounce You Chuck &amp; Larry</title>
    <desc lang="en">When two testosterone-fueled firemen attempt to register as domestic partners in order to bypass the bureaucratic red tape preventing one of them from naming his own two children as his life-insurance beneficiaries, their low-key ruse turns into headline news in this quirky matrimonial comedy starring Adam Sandler and Kevin James. Chuck Levine (Sandler) and Larry Valentine (James) are two New York City firefighters whose longtime friendship has endured many a five-alarm fire. All that widower Larry wants is to ensure that his two children will be taken care of if anything should happen to him on the job, and all that single blaze-battler Chuck wants is to carry on with his carefree life of noncommitment. Having once rescued Larry from certain death in a particularly fearsome inferno, beholden Chuck feels forever indebted to his brave friend and has vowed to repay the favor when the time is right. When Larry discovers that the only means of circumventing the civic red tape that could throw his children's futures into jeopardy is to take Chuck as his lawfully wedded husband, his obligated pal reluctantly agrees to step up to the alter with the understanding that the arrangement will be a well-kept secret between themselves and the justice of the peace. A potentially fatal flaw in their presumably foolproof plan is soon revealed, however, when an overzealous bureaucrat decides to question Chuck and Larry's partnership. Subsequently forced to embark on a mandatory honeymoon and pose as starry-eyed newlyweds, Chuck and Larry quickly discover just how important it can be to stick by a friend in his or her time of need. Jessica Biel, Steve Buscemi, Ving Rhames, and Dan Aykroyd co-star in a comedy from The Benchwarmers director Dennis Dugan(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Blast From the Past</title>
    <desc lang="en">In 1962, Calvin Webber (Christopher Walken) was a brilliant but somewhat paranoid scientist living with his Donna Reed-esque wife, Helen (Sissy Spacek), in Los Angeles. In the midst of the Cuban Missile Crisis, a plane crashed into the Webber's yard. Mistaking the blast for "the big one," the Webbers moved into their elaborate bomb shelter to wait out the half-life of radioactive fallout. In the shelter, now a sort of time capsule, Calvin and Helen conceived and raised their son Adam (played as an adult by Brendan Fraser). For 35 years, Adam was raised on Jackie Gleason, Perry Como, and stories about life on the surface. Calvin taught his son about science, baseball, and communists while Mom taught Adam about dancing, good manners, and charming young ladies. Just in time, too, as Adam is sent to the surface to gather supplies and find a wife, preferably a nice, non-mutant girl from Pasadena with which to repopulate the world. Once this "fish out of water" story is set up, the fish, Adam, is set adrift in a sea of supermarkets and adult bookstores, but is soon caught by Eve Rustikov (Alicia Silverstone). Completely lost above ground, Adam enlists Eve's help to navigate his new world and find the supplies on his list. The literally sheltered Adam falls for this bitter, cynical, street-smart woman who grew up in a bleak Los Angeles with little use for love. Living with her gay roommate, Troy (Dave Foley), Eve has had her hopes chipped away by a long line of dead-end jobs and loser boyfriends. When the throwback Adam enters her life with his sunny disposition, seersucker jacket, and joy at seeing the sky, she can't help but fall in love(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Deke DaSilva (Sylvester Stallone) and Matthew Fox (Billy Dee Williams) are New York police officers specially assigned to a special multi-national team dedicated to tracking down terrorist Wulfgar (Rutger Hauer). Wulfgar planted a bomb in a London department store, killing several children and he is now an outcast, hunted by both the police and his fellow gang members. He has extensive plastic surgery and resumes his activities aided by Shakka (Persis Khambutta), a completely psychotic fellow outcast. Soon DaSilva and Wulfgar are engaged in a violent battle of wits as Wulfgar resumes his terrorist activities and threatens New York . This very effective thriller features a chilling performance by Rutger Hauer as the handsome, ruthless cold-blooded killer who charms women into helping him and then kills them. Sylvester Stallone gives an unusually understated emotionally vulnerable performance as a man trying to save lives while he saves his own marriage. The film makes excellent use of New York locales, particularly during a terrifying hijacking of a cable car where Wulfgar coolly decides which of the hostages will live or die(n)</desc>

After getting trapped in the elevator on their way out, however, events take a horrifically grim turn as the doors open to reveal that the once sterile and bustling surroundings are now ominously silent and dank. With mutilated bodies strewn about and murderous gang of monsters stalking them through an endless maze of corroded hallways, the only remaining hope for the frightened father and daughter now lies in the affected mind of a little girl who may understand more about the situation than anyone realizes(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Drumline</title>
    <desc lang="en">After decades of movies about college sports, the bands who take the field at halftime finally get their day in the sun in this musical comedy drama. Devon Miles (Nick Cannon) is a talented young percussionist from Harlem who wins a music scholarship to Atlanta A &amp; T, a prestigious African-American university. For years, Atlanta A &amp; T has won awards for their show-style marching band, who combine expert musicianship (incorporating funk, R&amp;B, and jazz rhythms into the traditional marching band repertoire) with choreography, dancing cheerleaders, and roof-raising showmanship. Dr. Aaron Lee (Orlando Jones), the school's band director, gives Devon a spot in the marching band's drumline, the heart and soul of a show-style band, but discovers Devon's previous musical education hardly meets his usual standard when he learns that his new drummer can't read music. Devon soon earns a reputation as a stubborn individualist within the band, not necessarily a good thing in an ensemble where a strictly unified performance is considers the ideal. Devon's cocksure attitude and streetwise style doesn't mesh very comfortably with Sean Taylor (Leonard Roberts), a disciplined senior who resents the presence of the upstart freshman in the drumline, and things become even less harmonious when Devon begins making a play for Laila (Zoe Saldana), a beautiful girl who is also being courted by Sean. Songwriter and record producer Dallas Austin, who has worked with Boyz II Men, TLC, and Pink, served as executive producer for Drumline, helped produce the film's musical score, and contributed his own experiences as a marching band member to the screenplay(n)</desc>

Meanwhile, as the snow begins to fall, misfortune strikes Michael's family, prompting the concerned father to reflect on his troubled past. Just when Michael's future looks to be teetering on the brink of disaster, however, a benevolent stranger (Willie Nelson) bestows his family a lavish new home under the one condition that they join in their new neighborhood's Christmas festivities. In the process, the man who forgot how to feel joy rediscovers that wide-eyed child who ran down the stairs every Christmas morning eager to see what Santa had left him under the tree.

    <desc lang="en">Something Like a War. At the turn of the 20th century, Ken Burns' documentary homage to baseball history enters its "second inning." Baseball's first decade in the new century began with the creation of a new league, as "Ban" Johnson's unbending will -- along with the 500-dollar bonus he offered National League players to switch allegiances -- forced the American League into being. Detroit's Ty Cobb ruled the decade on the field while the Pirates' Honus Wagner, another possible contender for best player, was pushed to the sidelines. Other highlights of volume two in this nine-part series include the development of independent professional Negro teams, as well as the story of female semi-pro pitcher Alta Weiss(n)</desc>

James has spent the past 35 years travelling the canals and waterways of Britain, and despite never liking houses, has decided now is the time to put down roots on dry land. Ben hoped a home standing on stilts above a marsh, and incorporating ship-like qualities such as a keel-shaped roof, will be enough to satisfy his boat-mad uncle. However, Ben's contractor goes into liquidation a few months into the project, taking £87,000 of the £300,000 budget, and when James decides to make a few tweaks to the design, alarm-bells begin to ring for the young architect.(n)</desc>

The case involved tracking down a hactivist collective known as Krampus, who were thought to have been responsible for an incident in which the internet crashed all over Washington, DC. McGee and Abby brought in three known cyber-terrorists for questioning, and discover evidence that links the trio to an attempted breach of the Congress email server and archive. However, when this line of inquiry reaches a dead-end, the team picks up a new lead that suggests an isolated hacker from Wisconsin may be responsible. This `lone wolf' scenario does not seem plausible to McGee, though, as he recalls a lesson his late dad taught him. Crime drama, starring Sean Murray.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A teenager is injured in a hit-and-run and the cops' only clue is a shattered wing mirror left at the scene, while a three-car collision is blamed on a drunk-driver, but testing him is proving tricky. An alert warns officers to look out for a car involved in an armed robbery, and when two traffic cops spot the vehicle, they take up the surveillance trail. A driver's insurance policy seems in order - until a hunch and a fingerprint detector prove otherwise - and a woman is lucky to be alive when she overturns her car while checking her mobile.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The biggest babies in the entertainment business take their act to Europe in this sequel to the surprise-hit animated feature The Rugrats Movie. Chuckie (voice of Christine Cavanaugh) has been fretting over his father Chas (voice of Michael Bell) and his status as a single father, as he wants to have a mommy like all of his friends. Chas and his father Stu (voice of Jack Riley) were hired to create a bevy of electronic critters for the newly opened Euro-Reptarland theme park, but the robots are acting up, and park manager Coco La Bouche (Susan Sarandon) is hopping mad. So Stu and Chas are flown to Paris to do some repairs, with Chas bringing Chuckie and all his friends along. Their visit to the City of Lights proves to be one adventure after another, as Chuckie tries to find a suitable mother (with Coco leading the pack) and Tommy (voice of Elizabeth Dailey) somehow gets behind the wheel of the giant Reptar robot. Rugrats in Paris: The Movie features original songs from T-Boz from TLC, The Baha Men, and Mylene Farmer, while John Lithgow, Debbie Reynolds, and Mako contribute to the voice cast(n)</desc>

Chuckie (voice of Christine Cavanaugh) has been fretting over his father Chas (voice of Michael Bell) and his status as a single father, as he wants to have a mommy like all of his friends. Chas and his father Stu (voice of Jack Riley) were hired to create a bevy of electronic critters for the newly opened Euro-Reptarland theme park, but the robots are acting up, and park manager Coco La Bouche (Susan Sarandon) is hopping mad. So Stu and Chas are flown to Paris to do some repairs, with Chas bringing Chuckie and all his friends along. Their visit to the City of Lights proves to be one adventure after another, as Chuckie tries to find a suitable mother (with Coco leading the pack) and Tommy (voice of Elizabeth Dailey) somehow gets behind the wheel of the giant Reptar robot. Rugrats in Paris: The Movie features original songs from T-Boz from TLC, The Baha Men, and Mylene Farmer, while John Lithgow, Debbie Reynolds, and Mako contribute to the voice cast(n)</desc>

The stories of legend are true, and the magical relics owned by such celebrated figures as Cinderella really exist. The malevolent force known as The Krugen knows well that the owner of these objects will reap ultimate power, because by obtaining the magical mirror once owned by the Evil Queen who tormented Snow White, they were able to herald the arrival of the Dark Ages. Centuries later, former Hunter Mason has become a loyal servant of The Krugen. He knows that once he locates all of the pieces of the mirror no one will be able to challenge his evil reign. But Jordyn and Carter Flynn hail from a long line of Hunters, and they've got just the skills to prevent Mason from achieving his diabolical plan. When Jordyn and Carter learn that their parents have gone missing during an important mission, they vow to track them down, and head off a disaster that could alter the entire course of history(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Space camp serves as a proving ground for a group of bright youths who use their knowledge of science and astrophysics to rescue astronauts stranded on the International Space Station following an unexpected crisis. For as far back as he can remember, Jimmy Hawkins (Thomas Horn) has dreamed of exploring the stars and visiting the International Space Station, just like his father, retired NASA astronaut Capt. Andy Hawkins (Dermot Mulroney). Space travel is no child's game, however, and Jimmy, a bright young astrophysics whiz, knows that both of his parents have serious reservations about his deep-rooted desire to follow in his father's footsteps. After furtively applying to win a seat on the next space shuttle, Jimmy learns that he has been accepted into a prestigious space camp run by Col. Roy Manley (Josh Lucas). Once there, Jimmy and a team of teens called the Warriors enter into a heated rivalry against the highly competitive Titans. The Warriors are just about to admit defeat when an emergency aboard the International Space Station leaves three astronauts isolated and alone hundreds of miles above Earth. With the fates of the helpless astronauts hanging in the balance, Jimmy and his team hatch an innovative rescue plan that impresses Commander Phillips (Danny Glover), and offers newfound hope for the future of space exploration(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Writer Jimmy McGovern's drama based on the UK's controversial joint enterprise law. When 17-year-old Johnjo gives his cousin and his friends a lift in his brother's car, he is unaware they are going to confront a local loudmouth who they feel needs putting in his place. As Johnjo waits in the car, one of them takes offence with an innocent bystander, who is fatally stabbed. The murder victim is the eldest child of Margaret and Tommy Ward, who has become estranged from his family after a bitter divorce. Struggling to make ends meet on her own, Margaret is nevertheless determined to fight through bureaucracy and the cool indifference of the banks to give Thomas the send-off he deserves. Johnjo makes his own way to the police station and lays the blame squarely with Kieran. However, career copper DI Hastings wants everyone possible to be tried for murder, and with the joint enterprise doctrine at his disposal, that includes Johnjo(n)</desc>

Frank Martin (Jason Statham) is a former special-forces officer who will transport anything anywhere for a price, and his latest assignment is acting as chauffeur for Jack Billings (Hunter Clary), the young son of politician Jefferson Billings (Matthew Modine), who has garnered no small amount of controversy for his aggressive efforts to stamp out the trade in illegal drugs. One day, Frank is to take Jack to the doctor for a checkup while his mother, Audrey (Amber Valletta), sets up a birthday party for the tyke. However, Jack's doctor is not who he appears to be -- he's actually Dimitri (Jason Flemyng), a Russian agent well versed in viruses who works with criminal kingpin Gianni (Alessandro Gassman). After a long and hard-fought chase with Frank, the bad guys get ahold of little Jack and hold him for ransom. The parents comply with their monetary demands and soon have their son back at home -- but little do they know that the boy has secretly been injected with a deadly and easily spread virus, which the terrorists hope to spread to the boy's powerful father and other politicians whom Jefferson will soon be addressing at a public event. When Frank learns what has happened to young Jack, he sets out to find the culprits -- and the antidote that will save the boy and all others who have been exposed to the virus from dying a painful death -- though his foes have stacked the deck so that it looks as if Frank has been complicit in the crime(n)</desc>

Once upon a time, Ben Kalmen (Douglas) had everything a man could possibly want -- a high-paying job, a beautiful wife, and a spacious Manhattan apartment -- but now all of that is a distant memory. The former owner of a successful auto dealership, Ben has recently lost everything thanks to his own inability to resist his impulses. But the resilient Ben isn't the type of guy to stay down for the count, and lately things are starting to look up for him again. Despite being divorced from his former college sweetheart Nancy (Susan Sarandon), Ben still manages to see his daughter, Susan (Jenna Fischer), and his grandson on a regular basis, and his new girlfriend, Jordan (Mary-Louise Parker), may have just the connections needed to help the floundering businessman get his career back on track. When Ben takes Jordan's college-bound daughter, Allyson (Imogen Poots), on a tour of a prospective school, however, his steely new resolve is put to the ultimate test(n)</desc>

Working on a tip that members of the group are working out of a brothel called the Peony Pavilion, Jin arrives there in disguise and is introduced to a beautiful blind dancer named Mei (Zhang Ziyi). After watching Mei's performance following several drinks, Jin drunkenly attempts to have his way with her, and Leo is forced to intervene. After gaining Mei's trust in a game of skill, Leo arrests her and informs her that she'll be tortured if she doesn't tell all she knows about the Flying Daggers. Jin responds by helping Mei break out of prison, but he has an ulterior motive -- by following her, Leo and Jin are certain she'll lead them to the Flying Daggers. However, as he helps the blind girl find her way back home, Jin finds himself falling in love with Mei, and isn't certain if he's willing to betray her again(n)</desc>

Don Cheadle plays Hutu Paul Rusesabagina, the manager of a four-star hotel in the capital Kigali, who's married to Tutsi Tatiana. When the Hutus start massacring Tutsis, he gives refuge to over 1000 Tutsis in the hotel and its grounds. At first, he uses the hotel's stock of beer, wine and spirits to bribe the marauding, murderous Hutu gangs. But as stocks run low, he must use all the diplomatic skills he learnt as a successful manager to save not just the lives of the Tutsis but his own and those of his family. The film also stars Nick Nolte as Col Oliver, a UN representative in the capital who finds himself impotent and without any support as the world abandons Rwanda's Tutsis to their terrible fate(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Steel Magnolias</title>
    <desc lang="en">The title refers to those seemingly frail Southern belles who survive any and all deprivations through whims of iron. Robert Harling's original stage play was set exclusively in a Louisiana beauty parlor where an all-female cast of characters laughed, cried and compared menfolk. The film expands the playing field by including scenes at picnics, hospitals and the like, and by visually depicting the males who never appeared in the stage version. Dolly Parton plays the goodnatured beauty-shop owner, while Shirley MacLaine is the cantankerous town eccentric, decked out in grungy overalls and speaking fluent Trash. Well-to-do Sally Field bravely endures several assaults to her sensibilities, not the least of which is the illness (and subsequent death) of daughter Julia Roberts. The performances are first-rate, with the possible exception of Daryl Hannah's overemphatic portrayal of a gawky hairdresser. The film stumbles a bit in its depiction of the male characters as fools and deadheads, and in the final overlong hospital scenes involving the comatose Roberts, which play like a road company version of Terms of Endearment. Otherwise, Steel Magnolias is a prime example of ensemble filmmaking, lovingly coordinated by director Herbert Ross. (Sidebar: Herbert Ross was reportedly rather rough on Julia Roberts, deriding her lack of experience. The rest of the female cast rallied around Roberts and told the director to lay off or pay the price)(n)</desc>

In a van made entirely of pure marijuana, the two set out on a ride from Los Angeles to Mexico and back. Despite all of this, they still have time to enter and win a "battle-of-the-bands" contest.

    <desc lang="en">The many emotional scars left by South Africa's history of institutionalized racism come under the microscope in this drama. As South Africa comes to terms with the legacy of apartheid, their government has created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, in which the perpetrators of racial violence and injustice must come face to face with their victims if they are to be forgiven for their crimes. Langston Whitfield (Samuel L. Jackson) is an African-American journalist who is assigned to cover these hearings by The Washington Post; Whitfield doubts the efficacy of this process, and sets out to interview Col. De Jager (Brendan Gleeson), a notorious former officer of the South African police who was famous for his violence against blacks in order to put this method to the test. While in South Africa, Whitfield meets Anna Malan (Juliette Binoche), an Afrikaner poet who is covering the hearing for a radio station and is both appalled and disturbed by the details of the violence inflicted against her countrymen. After striking up a friendship, Whitfield and Malan become romantically involved as they try to come to terms with their feelings about what they've learned.

    <title lang="en">The Caveman's Valentine</title>
    <desc lang="en">A man struggles back from madness to avenge the death of someone he knew in an intelligent thriller based on the acclaimed novel by George Dawes Green. Romulus Ledbetter (Samuel L. Jackson) once had a career as an acclaimed concert pianist, a position at the Juilliard School of Music, and a loving wife and children. But Ledbetter's life has been devastated by paranoid schizophrenia; now homeless, Ledbetter wanders the streets of New York City as he rails against Cornelius Gould Stuyvesant, a man whom he believes controls all the evil in the world while following his movements from a perch atop the Chrysler Building. Most nights, Ledbetter takes shelter in a cave in Central Park, earning him the nickname "the Caveman." One morning, Ledbetter discovers a frozen corpse caught in the branches of a tree near his cave; the body is that of Scotty (Sean MacMahaon), a homeless drug addict who was close friends with his pal Matthew (Rodney Eastman). Ledbetter is determined to get justice for Scotty, and he's also eager to prove himself to his daughter Lulu (Aunjanue Ellis), now a New York City police officer. While Ledbetter is at first convinced that his nemesis Stuyvesant is responsible for Scotty's death, in time he focuses on another suspect: David Leppenraub (Colm Feore), a famous photographer known for his controversial erotic images of young men, who occasionally hired Scotty as a model. As Ledbetter attempts to investigate Leppenraub's possible role in the murder, he soon gains an unexpected ally -- Moira (Ann Magnuson), a noted sculptor and Leppenraub's sister. The Caveman's Valentine marked the major-studio debut for director Kasi Lemmons, who made an impressive debut in 1997 with the independent drama Eve's Bayou(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Which Way Is Up?</title>
    <desc lang="en">This Americanized remake of Lina Wertmuller's The Seduction of Mimi offered audiences the novelty of seeing Richard Pryor performing three different roles in the same film. Which Way Is Up? tells the tale of Leroy Jones (Pryor), a poor orange picker who gets fired from his job when he accidentally joins a worker's union during a demonstration. He is forced to travel to Los Angeles and abandon his family, which includes his wife, Annie Mae (Margaret Avery), and his perpetually randy father, Rufus (also Pryor). While there, he falls in love with labor organizer Vanetta (Lonette McKee), but is soon rehired by his former employers when they realize he is easily manipulated. Back home, Leroy discovers his new managerial role alienates him from his former friends as he tries to divide his time between Annie Mae and Vanetta. When he discovers Annie Mae has been impregnated by the Reverend Lennox Thomas (Pryor's 3rd role) during his absence, Leroy sets his sights on seducing Lennox's wife. The resulting film had ambition to spare, but was generally panned as an inferior remake by the critics and failed to find a mass audience. However, Which Way Is Up? gained a second lease on life via cable and home video and has become a cult favorite with Pryor's fans(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Winning is everything, even if you have to lie, and cheat to do it. That is the under-lying message of this dramatic expose of college basketball recruiters. Up till recently, Pete Bell has been a winning coach for Western U's basketball team. But this year has been different. The film opens with the coach ripping into the team for another dreadful game. Bell knows that if his team continues to lose, he will lose his job. He has no choice but to recruit more talent. He begins his search for better players and finds three good prospects: Chicago player Butch Hardaway, an accurate shooter; Ricky, an enormously tall boy form French Lick, Indiana; and Neon, a temperamental giant. Together these three offer unbeatable potential if he can get them to come to Western. But it's not easy. The first two make exorbitant demands involving a lot of cash, new homes, and farm equipment. Neon asks for nothing but gets a new luxury car. Coach Pete is already dealing with allegations of shadiness and does not want to give in, but he is forced to by the alumni organization leader. Pete does not cope well(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Push</title>
    <desc lang="en">Lucky Number Slevin director Paul McGuigan takes the helm for this action thriller concerning a group of telekinetic American ex-patriots who band together in an attempt to take down the clandestine government agency that's genetically transforming normal citizens into powerful psychic warriors. The Division is a shadowy government operation devoted to making humankind the ultimate weapon. Those who accept this transformation have the power to move objects with the mind, see the future before it happens, create new realities, and dispense of their enemies without so much as a single touch; those who are unwilling to participate are immediately terminated. Nick Gant (Chris Evans) is a "mover," a second-generation telekinetic who went into hiding after the Division killed his father more than a decade earlier. He lives a life of anonymity in Hong Kong, a densely populated place where fugitive psychics such as himself are safe as long as they can keep their unique gift secret. Suddenly into Nick's life comes 13-year-old "watcher" Cassie Holmes (Dakota Fanning), a clairvoyant who needs his help in tracking down escaped "pusher" Kira, who may hold the key to bringing down the Division once and for all. A "pusher" is the most powerful kind of psychic due to his or her ability to influence the actions of others by planting thoughts in their minds. Now, as Nick emerges from hiding in order to help Cassie find Kira, the Division's human bloodhounds are hot on their trail. In order to elude the authorities, they'll need to disappear into the seedy underbelly of the city while relying on a team of rogue psychics to help cover their tracks. But Division Agent Henry Carver (Djimon Hounsou) is a powerful pusher who has made it his mission to stop them at all costs, regardless of the collateral damages that may occur in the process(n)</desc>

Things take an even grimmer turn when Piper (Holly Marie Combs) is mortally wounded by a "witch wannabe." Desperately, the sisters try to strike a deal with the demonic forces. Having already headed to the Underworld to purge Cole of his evil side, Phoebe (Alyssa Milano) offers to remain there forever if only time can be reversed so that her sister's life will be spared. Thus, the ball starts rolling for the cliffhanger climax of Charmed's third season -- a climax that will permanently eliminate one of the series' most popular co-stars from the cast roster!(n)</desc>
