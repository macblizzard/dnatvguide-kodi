    <title lang="en">Shaft</title>
    <desc lang="en">This action drama puts a new spin on Shaft, one of the key "blaxploitation" films of the 1970s. John Shaft (Samuel L. Jackson), the namesake nephew of the legendary private eye (Richard Roundtree), is a street-smart police detective who with his partner Carmen Velez (Vanessa L. Williams) has been assigned to a racially motivated murder case, in which a black college student was killed in front of a restaurant by Walter Williams Jr. (Christian Bale), the sociopathic son of a New York construction tycoon, who then fled the country rather than face prosecution. Diane Palmieri (Toni Collette), a waitress on a smoke break, saw the murder, but she doesn't want to talk to the police. Two years later, Walter is forced to return to New York, but without Diane's testimony, the city doesn't have much of a case. Soon, Shaft, Walter Junior, and Walter Senior's goons are all looking for Diane, with Junior enlisting the help of Peoples Hernandez (Jeffrey Wright), a small-time drug dealer who will do anything to move into the big leagues. Shaft and Carmen find Diane, but discover that she had a good reason for being on the lam for the past two years. Amidst all this activity, John gets frequent advice from his uncle, with whom he ponders the idea of quitting the force and opening a detective agency. Shaft was directed by John Singleton, from a screenplay by Singleton, Richard Price, and Shane Salerno(n)</desc>

In their first original comedy of 1955 (their first two releases had been revamped stock footage), the Three Stooges are members of a woman-haters club who fall in love with the same girl, a brassy gold digger (Jean Willes). Moe is conned into marrying the dame and the trio take their revenge, Stooges style. One of the best of the team's later comedies, Gypped in the Penthouse benefited from a vigorous performance from the redoubtable Miss Willes, a blonde actress who excelled in playing tough broads(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">(1954) Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye and Rosemary Clooney star in this festive family favourite from prolific director Michael Curtiz. Bob Wallace (Crosby) and Phil Davis (Kaye) are friends who met while serving in World War II and have subsequently become a very successful song-and-dance team. They meet singing sisters Betty (Clooney) and Judy (Vera-Ellen) at a nightclub in Florida and, with a hint of romance in the air, together head off to rural Vermont, where the girls are booked to appear at a ski lodge. When they arrive, they discover that the place is run by the men's former commanding officer, Major General Waverly (Dean Jagger), who's in dire financial straits because unseasonably warm weather is keeping the snow at bay. So the four entertainers make plans to bail him out by staging a spectacular musical benefit show... Shot in Technicolor, the film was the first to be released in the high-resolution widescreen VistaVision format and, with its songs written by Irving Berlin, the movie was the year's top box-office hit(n)</desc>

Wesley is a man used to getting his way; he's an extortionist and crime boss who has nearly everyone in Jasper under his thumb, and he sets out to teach Dalton a lesson, while Dalton is determined to clean up the town like he breaks up brawls at the Double Duce. Sam Elliott plays Dalton's mentor Wade, and Red West, a one-time member of Elvis Presley's "Memphis Mafia," appears as Webster; Canadian blues-rock guitarist Jeff Healey leads the Double Duce house band(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Matt Lucas returns to narrate another light-hearted retrospective poking fun at Britain's viewing habits in the 1970s. This time, he focuses on the world of comedy, unfettered as it was to the conventions of political correctness. A selection of clips from hit TV shows illustrate how, if viewers were not straight, white, middle-class men, they were at risk of being offended, and highlights examples from On the Buses, The Two Ronnies, Dave Allen at Large and The Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club. Includes commentary and contributions by Melvyn Hayes, Eric Chappell, Bill Oddie, Krishnan Guru-Murthy, Grace Dent, Nish Kumar, Ellie Taylor, Joel Dommett and Phil Wang.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Death Defying Acts</title>
    <desc lang="en">My Brilliant Career and Oscar and Lucinda director Gillian Armstrong explores the final feat of the greatest illusionist ever to deceive a live audience in this docudrama concerning Harry Houdini's obsessive quest to find proof of an afterlife. The year is 1926, and Houdini (Guy Pearce) is an international superstar. Not only does the illusionist's otherworldly ability to bend reality hold audiences completely enthralled, but his easy charm finds him winning the hearts of his growing legion of fans as well. Yet behind Houdini's winning smile resides the restless heart of a tortured soul. Isolated by fame and drowning in regret over having not been present to hear his mother's last words, Houdini sets out in tour of Scotland and announces that he will pay 10,000 dollars to anyone who can prove spiritual contact with his deceased mother. But in his determination to prove that there is life after death, Houdini also becomes the target of countless charlatans, scam artists, and self-proclaimed spiritualists. Of course, stunning psychic Mary McGregor (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and her daughter/sidekick, Benji (Saoirse Ronan), seem remarkably sincere in their supernatural talents, yet that doesn't mean that the pair doesn't have their own ulterior motives for making a connection with the world-famous magic man(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">As 1945 began, Hitler's Third Reich was entering its death throes. In the west, Allied forces were within striking distance of the Rhine, while Red Army soldiers in the east were at the banks of the river Oder, just an hour's drive from Berlin. As the Allies advanced, they uncovered horrific evidence of Hitler's `final solution' - concentration camps filled with starving prisoners, piles of corpses and the gas chambers that the Germans had not had time to obliterate. The final battle for Berlin began on April 16 and nine days later the city was surrounded, with Soviet troops eliminating the remaining resistance.(n)</desc>

The US launched a two-pronged attack to drive Axis forces back, with one group heading through the jungles of the Solomon Islands and then on to New Guinea, while the others island-hopped across thousands of miles of the central Pacific. To achieve this, the US Navy had to pioneer new forms of warfare, using amphibious troops backed by carrier aircraft and supported by an extraordinary seaborne supply system.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The challenges predators face finding and catching prey in a forest, where more than half the animal species on Earth live. However, it proves a tricky environment for predators, as vision is often blocked, escape routes are numerous, and the terrain makes travelling at speed almost impossible. The programme features footage of tigers using their surroundings to ambush deer and pine martens making tunnels in the snow, as well as examining the strategies adopted by sparrowhawks, jumping spiders, tarsiers, eagles and chimpanzees.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A convicted arsonist schemes to get out of prison by convincing his debauched wife to seduce his retirement-ready parole officer in director John J. Curran's adaptation of a play by Angus MacLachlan (who also authored the screenplay). His career as a parole officer winding down after years of service, Jack Mabry (Robert De Niro) reluctantly accepts an assignment to reassess inmate Gerald "Stone" Creeson's (Edward Norton) case for an upcoming parole hearing. Convicted of setting a fire to make the murder of his grandparents look like an accidental death, Stone will do anything to get out from behind bars, and his wife, Lucetta (Milla Jovovich), is willing to do whatever it takes to help secure her husband's freedom -- including seducing Jack. Meanwhile, Jack's devoted wife, Madylyn (Frances Conroy), has suffered with the emotional weight of her husband's demanding job for far too long(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">No one can escape from Alcatraz, right? Try telling that to lifer Frank Morris (Clint Eastwood). This Donald Siegel-directed nailbiter is a reenactment of Frank Morris' 1962 attempt to bust himself and two other cons out of The Rock. Eastwood, as Morris, tilts with nasty warden Patrick McGoohan for a while, befriends several fellow prisoners, and picks the guys with whom he'll make his escape. Among his break-out buddies are the Anglin Brothers (Fred Ward and Jack Thibeau), with whom he'd served in other lockups, and several others who've got their own special reasons to despise the sadistic McGoohan. Filmed on location at the newly renovated Alcatraz, Escape From Alcatraz was another box-office winner for the Eastwood/Siegel combo(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Part high-tech spy thriller and part psychological study, Eye of the Beholder was Ewan McGregor's first feature film following his mainstream breakthrough performance in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. The Eye (Ewan McGregor) is an agent of the British Secret Service, equipped with the latest in high-tech crime fighting gadgetry and assisted by his indefatigable collegue, Hilary (k.d. lang). The Eye's latest assignment is a surveillance project; the son of a well-known politician has been spending a great deal of money on someone, and they would like to know who and why. A little sleuthing reveals that the mysterious person taking the cash is a woman named Joanna (Ashley Judd), but the trail gets much stickier when the Eye witnesses Joanna pulling a knife and killing the politician's son. Normally, he'd take the shortcut to putting her behind bars, but some time ago he lost contact with his daughter when his wife left him; Joanna reminds the Eye of his daughter, and he's too fascinated with her to bring her to justice. The Eye now follows Joanna obsessively, and discovers that she's also involved with a blind man (Patrick Bergin) and has a history of emotional instability from being abandoned by her father at a young age. Eye of the Beholder was directed by Stephan Elliott, best known for the comedy The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert(n)</desc>

Ejiofor plays Mike Terry, a jujitsu master who co-runs a very modest martial arts studio in Los Angeles with his bossy wife, Sondra (Alice Braga). Mike demonstrates an unwavering commitment to his craft and draws a cadre of defiantly loyal pupils including Joe (Max Martini), an LAPD cop. All told, it appears that he has chosen a peaceful and conflict-free path in life. The dedicated martial artist's fate takes an unanticipated turn, however, one evening when a young woman named Laura (Emily Mortimer) bursts into the academy in a state of near hysteria, and reaches for a policeman's gun when he tries to restrain her. One thing leads to another, and before long, Laura is regularly receiving martial arts lessons from Mike. As master begins to teach pupil and his martial arts philosophies emerge, his path also crisscrosses with that of a Hollywood movie star, Chet Frank (Tim Allen), when he saves the fellow from a beating at a local club and gets invited (along with Sondra) to Chet's house for dinner. Chet extends gestures of friendship, and Mike's guard breaks down; he speaks openly and candidly of a special martial arts method he employs that requires one of the participants to "assume a handicap." In time, the association with Chet leads to involvement in the motion-picture industry, and relations with a bevy of characters who aren't exactly what they seem -- including a pay-per-view fight mogul (Ricky Jay) and Chet's slimy and manipulative manager (Joe Mantegna)(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">For 60 years, a mysterious nameless monk zigzagged the globe to protect an ancient scroll that grants remarkable powers to those who possess it. But now the monk must find someone new to assume the responsibility. As fate would have it, the new caretaker turns out to be a scruffy and distinctly non-enlightened petty thief named Kar. But when he inadvertently saves the Bulletproof Monk from capture, the two become partners in a scheme to save the world from the scroll's most avid pursuer. In the mission, they are aided by a beautiful Russian mob affiliate with amazing martial arts skills and a vested interest in keeping the scroll in virtuous hands(n)</desc>

TMZ on TV was seen primarily on local Fox or Fox-owned affiliates throughout the U.S(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This daily show-biz gossip and "expose" series was a spinoff of the popular interactive website TMZ, an acronym for the "Thirty Mile Zone" surrounding Hollywood.

By the time the TV version of TMZ premiered the week of September 10, 2007, the operation had once again scooped its scandal-rag competition with its coverage of O.J.

    <title lang="en">The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</title>
    <desc lang="en">In the mythical Middle-earth, a fantastic, mysterious world inhabited by men, Hobbits, wizards, elves, dwarfs and Trolls, lives Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood), a shy Hobbit who must accomplish a difficult mission to save his land's destiny. It all begins when Frodo receives a ring from his uncle Bilbo (Ian Holm) and wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) discovers it is the Unique Ring itself. This powerful ring has been conceived by Sauron, the dark Lord of Mordor (Sala Baker), and with it, it is possible to enslave the whole of the Middle-earth through the use of dark forces. To destroy the ring, Frodo must take it to a distant mountain in Mordor, a region controlled by the Master of Evil. Fortunately, he is accompanied by a group formed by Hobbits Sam (Sean Astin), Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), as well as Gandalf, the human warriors Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and Boromir (Sean Bean), and elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom). Together they have to confront dangerous obstacles in a frightening world of mystery and darkness. This spectacular adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's epic trilogy was directed by Peter Jackson(n)</desc>

Lemuel Gulliver works in the post room of a New York newspaper. Spying an opportunity to impress the beautiful editor Darcy Silverman, he stoops to plagiarising travel websites in order to win a commission to write his own travel piece. He succeeds, but his reward is an assignment to the Bermuda Triangle, where he inevitably vanishes without trace. Gulliver wakes up on the shores of an island that's home to a nation of tiny people who appear to be stuck in the 18th century. And they aren't at all sure what to do with this gargantuan beast that Providence has washed up among them.

    <desc lang="en">Nigella Lawson travels to Venice to soak up the atmosphere and gain inspiration for dishes for a Christmas party with an Italian twist. Back in the UK, she creates a tasty buffet menu for her guests, preparing a Venetian cocktail served with quick and easy canapes including Parmesan shortbreads and panettone stuffing squares. Nigella's take on the traditional roast bird is turkey breast stuffed with Italian sausage and marsala-steeped cranberries, served with salad and Brussels sprout pasta. Guests are treated to desserts including a marshmallow cappuccino pavlova and a Christmas pudding cake adorned with chocolate chips and pomegranate seeds.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A temp worker is promoted to permanent status and finds his whole world changing as a result in this satiric comedy. Josh (Josh Kornbluth) is an overstuffed aspiring writer who is trying to finish his first novel, but in the meantime he supports himself by working as an office temp. Josh has grown accustomed to the Byzantine world of temporary labor, particularly the bossy secretaries and chilly co-workers, but Josh manages to impress his latest employers enough that they offer to make him a permanent, full-time employee. While a fellow temp who worked for the same company warns Josh that taking the job would be a mistake, Josh takes the plunge anyway, and soon discovers that his fellow employees now embrace him as one of their own. He also discovers that Bob Shelby (Warren Keith), his new boss, is more than a little crazy, and when Bob gives Josh an assignment to mail a series of important letters, John finds that he's suddenly incapable of doing this seemingly simple task. Instead, Josh spends his days working on his book (on company time and on a company computer), with his fellow office drones offering emphatic encouragement. Josh Kornbluth adapted Haiku Tunnel (with the help of John Bellucci and Jacob Kornbluth) from a semi-improvised one-man show Kornbluth created with David Ford; the Kornbluth brothers also directed the film(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The "National Lampoon" franchise is resurrected for another politically incorrect collegiate romp with this R-rated gross-out sex comedy. National Lampoon's Van Wilder revolves around the exploits of its title character (Ryan Reynolds), a seventh-year senior who's made it his goal in life to help each and every Coolidge College undergrad succeed in life -- or at least in bed. Van's charmed life seems to have an expiration date, however; his father (Tim Matheson) has cut off his presumably vast allowance. Financial insecurity doesn't phase the big man on campus, and he soon starts up a lucrative cottage industry as a planner of high-priced campus blowouts. When an enterprising reporter from the college paper gets wind of Van's liberal interpretation of the school's code of conduct, it seems his gig is up -- unless, of course, he can charm the hard-edged Gwen (Tara Reid) into accepting his uniquely skewed world view. In addition to Matheson, Van Wilder features cameos from a number of '80s teen movie stalwarts, including Edie McClurg, Paul Gleason, and Erik Estrada(n)</desc>

Wulfgar planted a bomb in a London department store, killing several children and he is now an outcast, hunted by both the police and his fellow gang members. He has extensive plastic surgery and resumes his activities aided by Shakka (Persis Khambutta), a completely psychotic fellow outcast. Soon DaSilva and Wulfgar are engaged in a violent battle of wits as Wulfgar resumes his terrorist activities and threatens New York . This very effective thriller features a chilling performance by Rutger Hauer as the handsome, ruthless cold-blooded killer who charms women into helping him and then kills them. Sylvester Stallone gives an unusually understated emotionally vulnerable performance as a man trying to save lives while he saves his own marriage.

    <title lang="en">Sea of Love</title>
    <desc lang="en">In this thriller, Al Pacino stars as Frank Keller, an alcoholic policeman in the depths of middle-age crisis. Frank begins investigating a serial killer who finds her victims through the personal ads and kills them while the song "Sea of Love" plays on the stereo. Responding to one of the ads, Frank finds himself falling in love with the sultry blonde Helen (Ellen Barkin), who happens to be the most likely suspect. Aside from Richard Price's crackling script, one of the most remarkable things about Sea of Love is Pacino's riveting performance. It was the first in many years to gain considerable critical acclaim and box office success, making the movie instrumental in his comeback in the late '80s and early '90s. Pacino doesn't over-act in Sea of Love, which gives its tense story more suspense, and helps make the somewhat far-fetched plot believable(n)</desc>

In 1935, inmates at the Cold Mountain Correctional Facility call Death Row "The Green Mile" because of the dark green linoleum that tiles the floor. Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) is the head guard on the Green Mile when a new inmate is brought into his custody: John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), convicted of the sadistic murder of two young girls. Despite his size and the fearsome crimes for which he's serving time, Coffey seems to be a kind and well-mannered person who behaves more like an innocent child than a hardened criminal. Soon Edgecomb and two of his fellow guards, Howell (David Morse) and Stanton Barry Pepper), notice something odd about Coffey: he's able to perform what seem to be miracles of healing among his fellow inmates, leading them to wonder just what sort of person he could be, and if he could have committed the crimes with which he was charged. The Green Mile also stars James Cromwell as the warden; Michael Jeter, Sam Rockwell, and Graham Greene as inmates awaiting dates with the electric chair; and Harry Dean Stanton as a clever trustee(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Underworld: Rise of the Lycans</title>
    <desc lang="en">Michael Sheen, Bill Nighy and Rhona Mitra star in this fantasy horror prequel, set 1000 years before the events detailed in Underworld and Underworld: Evolution. It's the age-old story of 'boy meets girl but must overcome opposition for love to run its course'. Except that the 'boy' is Lucian, a werewolf who, along with the rest of his kind, is in servitude to his vampire overlords. And the 'girl' is Sonja, daughter of Viktor, the leader of the vampires. And it's not so much opposition that they both face as instant death, should Viktor hear even a rumour of their relationship. Thus, for the sake of his love, as well as the future of his race, Lucian orchestrates the werewolf uprising that will lead to a millennium of bellicosity between the two species... Directed, in his feature debut, by special effects man (and creature designer for the other two movies) Patrick Tatopoulos. Sheen puts in an impassioned, muscular performance, while Nighy plays his part with ironic gusto(n)</desc>

Rose (Susan Sarandon) is a middle-aged divorcée whose mother is in the hospital with an advanced case of Alzheimer's disease; while Rose wants one more chance to tell her mother that she loves her, the woman doesn't even know who she is anymore. Mike (Paul Walker) is a police officer who has become the obsessive focus of an elderly waiter, Artie (Alan Arkin), who is convinced Mike is the reincarnation of his late wife. Meanwhile, Mike is engaged to marry the beautiful Nina (Penélope Cruz), but he's so consumed with jealousy and suspicion that she's not sure if she can go through with the wedding. And Jules (Marcus Thomas) is a street hustler who has only one fond memory of Christmas -- ending up in an emergency room, where the staff was holding a party. Jules wants to relive the experience, and is even willing to injure himself to do so. Noel was the first directorial effort from actor and playwright Chazz Palminteri(n)</desc>

But the spot they picked to swim became a deadly playground when Chantal was attacked by a crocodile. Finally, young Jayden went for a swim in remote north Queensland with family friends when he was bitten by the highly venomous stonefish. Within minutes, he was in excruciating pain and needed urgent medical attention but on the way to the mainland the boat got bogged in sand leaving them stranded(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Queen's Garden</title>
    <desc lang="en">Part two of two. In winter, there are fewer tourists at Buckingham Palace, but Alan Titchmarsh discovers all manner of animal visitors to the grounds as he installs hidden cameras in trees and bird boxes. As spring arrives early, he learns about the garden's role as a nursery, not just to young animals but also to young royals. In late May, a transformation takes place - a tented village on the lawn is a sign that party season is coming, and the race is on for the gardeners to put the finishing touches to 12 months of work. The programme ends with the climax of the year, as the Queen attends a garden party to greet her guests.(n)</desc>

As Zia sets out to locate his ill-fated former companion and experience the joys that eluded the couple in life, he is joined in his quest by a lovelorn Russian rocker named Eugene (Shea Wigham) and an accidental tourist named Mikal (Shannyn Sossamon), who's looking for a way out of the sorrowful stir(n)</desc>

Now trapped in a bleak metaphysical landscape populated entirely by suicide victims blearily searching for the joys that eluded them in the physical realm, Zia soon learns that the love is one of the latest arrivals in the dreary land of the dead. As Zia sets out to locate his ill-fated former companion and experience the joys that eluded the couple in life, he is joined in his quest by a lovelorn Russian rocker named Eugene (Shea Wigham) and an accidental tourist named Mikal (Shannyn Sossamon), who's looking for a way out of the sorrowful stir(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Daydream Nation</title>
    <desc lang="en">A girl looking for kicks gets a whole lot more than she bargained for in a singularly curious town in this dark comedy. Caroline Wexler (Kat Dennings) is a clever but cynical 17-year-old whose father is still adjusting to the death of his wife. Caroline's dad takes a new job and they move to a strange community where the sky is always dark thanks to an industrial fire that's been burning for several months and isn't going to be put out anytime soon. Caroline doesn't have much use for her backward drug-addled classmates, and so to relieve her boredom she sets out to seduce Mr. Anderson (Josh Lucas), the best-looking man on the school's faculty. While Mr. Anderson tries to avoid responding to Caroline's blunt sexual overtures, it isn't long before he succumbs to her charms and is sleeping with his new student. But Caroline's new romance turns into a romantic triangle when Thurston (Reece Thompson), one of her stoner classmates, falls head over heels for her and she gives him a chance to impress her. Before long, Thurston is declaring Caroline the love of his life, Mr. Anderson is angry over having a rival for her affections, and the local serial killer begins to make their presence known, picking off the town's teenagers one by one. Also featuring Andie MacDowell and Ted Whittall, Daydream Nation was the first feature film from writer and director Mike Goldbach(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Paid in Full</title>
    <desc lang="en">Paid in Full marks the feature debut of director Charles Stone III, who rose to fame after creating Budweiser's "Wassup" commercials. The urban gangster drama is loosely based on the true story of 1980s Harlem drug kingpins AZ, Rich Porter, and Alpo. (This story was also the basis for a documentary, Game Over (Part 1).) Ace (Wood Harris) works at a laundromat, struggling to get by, while his friend Mitch (Mekhi Phifer) lives the high life selling heroin. His sister's boyfriend, Calvin (Kevin Carroll) also sells drugs, and looks down on Ace for struggling to earn a living. Out delivering laundry one day, Ace meets Lulu (Esai Morales), a big time coke dealer, who lives better than anyone Ace has ever known. When Lulu leaves some coke in the pocket of a coat he's having cleaned, Ace returns it to him, and Lulu rewards him for his honesty by letting him keep the drugs.

    <desc lang="en">Hip-hop mogul Damon Dash wrote, directed, and stars in this hard-hitting examination of life in the criminal underground of a great city. Three different crime bosses are locked in a battle over the drug trade in Philadelphia. New York transplant Dame (Damon Dash) and his umbrella crew command a powerful network that controls the city's dope traffic, but he has two bitter rivals who both oversee competing gangs from behind bars -- Beans (Beanie Siegel), Philly-born leader of the once-dominant ABM Crime Syndicate, and Loco (Noreaga), a slick street hustler from Miami who has the bankroll to finance a powerful operation. As these three men and their underlings scramble for money and power, another player is quietly consolidating his forces and rising up against them. State Property 2: Philly Streets also features supporting performances from Mariah Carey, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Cam'ron, and a handful of other hip-hop and R&amp;B stars(n)</desc>

Caroline Wexler (Kat Dennings) is a clever but cynical 17-year-old whose father is still adjusting to the death of his wife. Caroline's dad takes a new job and they move to a strange community where the sky is always dark thanks to an industrial fire that's been burning for several months and isn't going to be put out anytime soon. Caroline doesn't have much use for her backward drug-addled classmates, and so to relieve her boredom she sets out to seduce Mr. Anderson (Josh Lucas), the best-looking man on the school's faculty. While Mr. Anderson tries to avoid responding to Caroline's blunt sexual overtures, it isn't long before he succumbs to her charms and is sleeping with his new student. But Caroline's new romance turns into a romantic triangle when Thurston (Reece Thompson), one of her stoner classmates, falls head over heels for her and she gives him a chance to impress her. Before long, Thurston is declaring Caroline the love of his life, Mr. Anderson is angry over having a rival for her affections, and the local serial killer begins to make their presence known, picking off the town's teenagers one by one.

Alex Stillman (Bret Harrison) is a Yale senior with a knack for Texas Hold 'Em. But while Alex dreams of the day he'll be able to dominate the tables out in Las Vegas, he hasn't mastered the art of the cards just yet. Alex's luck begins to change, however, after a chance encounter with legendary poker player Tommy Vinson (Burt Reynolds). Tommy gave up gambling 20 years ago in hopes that he could save his family. He recognizes the potential in Alex, and he's beginning to regain his confidence after two decades of maintaining a low profile. Alex agrees to become Tommy's protégé, and together the pair wins every tournament they enter. But Alex's attraction to beautiful Las Vegas call girl Michelle (Shannon Elizabeth) has caused his attention shift away from the tables, and that distraction has opened up a deep chasm between the emerging talent and the undisputed master. Later, after Alex and Tommy call off their partnership, they find themselves on opposite sides of the table at the prestigious World Poker Tour. Who will take the top prize? Will it be the old pro who promised he would never gamble again or the newcomer who learned all of his tricks from the true master of the trade?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Actor Josh Radnor makes his debut as a writer and director with this independent comedy drama in which a handful of people riding the gap between their late twenties and early thirties navigate the sometimes tricky path of adulthood in New York City. Sam (Radnor) is a struggling writer who has trouble with long-term relationships; one day while on the subway, he meets Rasheen (Michael Algieri), a young boy who has been abandoned by his parents. Sam takes the boy in, which gives him a preview of parenthood but also proves to be more complicated than he expected. Sam is infatuated with Mississippi (Kate Mara), a bartender with a dream of making it as a musician; tired of one-night stands, she agrees to move in with Sam for a few days to see how she feels about a "real" relationship, but Rasheen's presence makes things awkward. Another of Sam's sometime girlfriends is Annie (Malin Akerman), who suffers from a rare medical condition that prevents her from having any hair. Though she's beautiful, Annie's lack of hair has caused her to have a dire self-image and she jumps from one relationship to another with a handful of men, some of whom treat her poorly. And Mary Catherine (Zoe Kazan) and Charlie (Pablo Schreiber) are a couple whose relationship is teetering on the brink as he considers a lucrative job offer in Los Angeles while she refuses to budge. Happythankyoumoreplease received its world premiere at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival, where it received the audience award for Best Dramatic Feature(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Director Stephen Chow made his name in this country with the deliriously wonderful Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle continues his love of comedy kung-fu films. Set in pre-revolutionary China, Chow plays Sing, a street hustler who makes the mistake of pretending to be a member of the notorious Axe gang. He becomes caught up in a war between the gang and the residents of Pig Sty Alley, which the gang want to take over. Little do they know that two of the Alley's residents are retired martial arts experts and soon the fists and feet are flying in knockabout fights that owe as much to Kill Bill (some of the wire work is done by Yuen Wo Ping, who worked on Tarantino's film) as they do to classic Hollywood silent comedies. Film fans can enjoy Chow's references to films ranging from Top Hat to The Shining while the rest can just enjoy a wildly entertaining romp. In Cantonese with English subtitles(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Undercover Brother began life as an animated series on the Internet. The satirical cartoon was created by novelist and screenwriter John Ridley (Three Kings) for the website /urbanentertainment.com. Ridley wrote the screenplay with Michael McCullers, co-writer of the Austin Powers sequels, and it was directed by Malcolm D. Lee (Spike Lee's cousin, and the writer/director of The Best Man). The film stars Eddie Griffin (of TV's Malcolm and Eddie) as Undercover Brother, he of the gold Cadillac convertible and huge Afro, who uses gadgets and disguises to steal from the rich and give to the poor. His activities are discovered by the B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D., a spy organization devoted to subverting The Man (Robert Trumbull) and his henchman, Mr. Feather (Chris Kattan), who use their power over the media to demean black people and destroy racial unity. The spy organization is run by The Chief (Chi McBride), who is constantly screaming at his subordinates. They include Sistah Girl (Aunjanue Ellis), a beautiful martial artist, Conspiracy Brother (Dave Chappelle), who sees white supremacist plots everywhere, and Smart Brother (Gary Anthony Williams, who provided the voice of Undercover Brother in the cartoon), who supplies the operatives with gadgets and information. When a popular black political figure, General Boutwell (Billy Dee Williams), calls a press conference, presumably to announce his presidential candidacy, and instead announces that he's opening a chain of fried chicken restaurants, the B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D. rightly suspects foul play, and recruits Undercover Brother to look into it.

    <title lang="en">Snow Dogs</title>
    <desc lang="en">Miami dentist Ted Brooks is delighted to hear that he has been named his mother's will, and travels to Alaska to claim his inheritance. But he discovers his new property is slightly unusual: he now owns a team of sled dogs. It turns out his mother was an Alaskan sled-racing champion! Another shock awaits Ted in the frozen wastes: his real dad is a grumpy old white man who's only interested in Ted's dogs. The fun comes as thick and fast as a blizzard when Ted decides to gain his dad's respect by defending his mother's title. The only trouble is, he's never raced sled dogs in his life... Two Oscar winners come together in this hilarious movie, as Cuba Gooding Jr plays the dentist who spends a lot of his time up to his waist in snow, while James Coburn is his father, who's out to get his son's inheritance. Laughter comes in flurries as Gooding proves how cool he is, in a very different way from his normal roles!(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Joshua</title>
    <desc lang="en">A mysterious stranger brings both spiritual comfort and a certain level of distrust to a small community in this drama based on the spiritual best-seller by Joseph Girzone. A mysterious man named Joshua (Tony Goldwyn) arrives in the small Midwestern town of Auburn sometime in the late 19th century. Joshua sets up a carpentry shop in Auburn, and soon develops a reputation for his kind and unselfish nature; after bad weather nearly destroys a church in the town's African-American neighborhood, Joshua offers to help repair the building, and has soon persuaded much of the community to offer their support, including Father Pat (Kurt Fuller), a priest at Auburn's Catholic church. Father Pat's superior, Father Tardone (F. Murray Abraham) is also struck by Joshua's talent, charm, and humble desire to help others, and asks him to carve a new statue of Saint Peter for their church. However, while much of the town is following the good example set by Joshua, when people begin to ascribe supernatural powers to the town's new carpenter, Father Tardone begins to become suspicious, and wants to know who Joshua really is and what he really intends to do in Auburn. Joshua features an original song score by popular contemporary Christian musician Michael W. Smith(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Last Night of a Jockey. In the tradition of his earlier Alcoa/Goodyear Theater episode "Eddie," Mickey Rooney delivers a tour de force solo performance in the Twilight Zone playlet "The Last Night of a Jockey." Barred from the track for life, crooked jockey Grady (Rooney) boozily expresses the wish to escape his sordid surroundings and become a truly "big man." His wish is granted by his lookalike alter ego (also Rooney), but there's a heavy price to be paid at fadeout time. The first Twilight Zone to be produced by William Froug, "The Last Night of a Jockey" was originally broadcast October 25, 1963(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">(1972) Father Ted Night is rounded off by the influential American film The Heartbreak Kid , starring Charles Grodin, Jeannie Berlin and Cybill Shepherd, which both Graham Linehan and Arthur Mathews cite as a major influence on their comedy writing. Elaine May's romantic tragic-comedy stars Grodin as Lenny Cantrow, newly married to Lila (Berlin). En route to their honeymoon in Miami, he's already beginning to have second doubts after seeing her eat an egg mayo sandwich and hearing her sing the same song over again. At the resort, disaster strikes when Lila gets sunburnt and is confined to their room. Lenny, alone on the beach, suddenly spies Kelly Corcoran (Shepherd) and falls for her on the spot. Dumping Lila, he pursues Kelly to her home in Minnesota and wins her heart. But he soon learns that not everything beautiful is perfect and that people are not just commodities to be cast aside on a whim. Premiere(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones</title>
    <desc lang="en">The fifth film -- and the second prequel -- in director George Lucas' historic Star Wars series, Star Wars: Episode II -- Attack of the Clones begins ten years following the events in Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace. Senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman), former queen of the planet Naboo, arrives on the capital planet of Coruscant and narrowly escapes an assassination attempt that would have prevented her from calling a senatorial vote to grant Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) emergency head-of-state powers. This extreme action would have been in response to the alarming number of planets that have seceded from the Republic and formed a threatening opposition alliance. The Jedi Council places Amidala under the guard of Obi-wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and his young apprentice, Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen), which paves the way for Kenobi and Skywalker to learn more about the assassination plot on Amidala's life after a second attempt is made. After reporting their preliminary findings to the Jedi Council, Skywalker and Kenobi are split up by the council -- with young Anakin accompanying Amidala back to Naboo. Meanwhile, Obi-wan starts following the clues from the second assassination attempt and finds himself traveling to the mysterious planet of Camino. Back on Naboo, Anakin and Amidala's fondness for each other begins to blossom into love, which is strictly forbidden by Jedi code and causes a great deal of angst for the politician and the Jedi apprentice. Furthermore, Anakin's recurring nightmares about his mother, Shmi (Pernilla August), whom he hasn't seen in ten years, force the young Jedi to make the tough decision to return to Tatooine in order to search for her. This decision proves to be pivotal as Anakin discovers his fears to be warranted, which prompts the young and reckless Jedi apprentice to react in a manner very unbecoming of a Jedi. In the meantime, Obi-wan makes a shocking discovery on Camino, which leads him to the nearby planet Geonosis and forces him to send word of his findings back to the Jedi Council. Amidala and Anakin intercept the message, retransmit it to the Jedi Council, and set off for Geonosis to assist Kenobi. As the three are reunited and imprisoned by a former Jedi, the evil Count Dooku (Christopher Lee), the Jedi Council -- led by Jedi Masters Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz) and Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) -- is forced to intervene and thus puts into motion cataclysmic changes for the Republic and its adversaries(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones</title>
    <desc lang="en">The fifth film -- and the second prequel -- in director George Lucas' historic Star Wars series, Star Wars: Episode II -- Attack of the Clones begins ten years following the events in Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace. Senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman), former queen of the planet Naboo, arrives on the capital planet of Coruscant and narrowly escapes an assassination attempt that would have prevented her from calling a senatorial vote to grant Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) emergency head-of-state powers. This extreme action would have been in response to the alarming number of planets that have seceded from the Republic and formed a threatening opposition alliance. The Jedi Council places Amidala under the guard of Obi-wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and his young apprentice, Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen), which paves the way for Kenobi and Skywalker to learn more about the assassination plot on Amidala's life after a second attempt is made. After reporting their preliminary findings to the Jedi Council, Skywalker and Kenobi are split up by the council -- with young Anakin accompanying Amidala back to Naboo. Meanwhile, Obi-wan starts following the clues from the second assassination attempt and finds himself traveling to the mysterious planet of Camino. Back on Naboo, Anakin and Amidala's fondness for each other begins to blossom into love, which is strictly forbidden by Jedi code and causes a great deal of angst for the politician and the Jedi apprentice. Furthermore, Anakin's recurring nightmares about his mother, Shmi (Pernilla August), whom he hasn't seen in ten years, force the young Jedi to make the tough decision to return to Tatooine in order to search for her. This decision proves to be pivotal as Anakin discovers his fears to be warranted, which prompts the young and reckless Jedi apprentice to react in a manner very unbecoming of a Jedi. In the meantime, Obi-wan makes a shocking discovery on Camino, which leads him to the nearby planet Geonosis and forces him to send word of his findings back to the Jedi Council. Amidala and Anakin intercept the message, retransmit it to the Jedi Council, and set off for Geonosis to assist Kenobi. As the three are reunited and imprisoned by a former Jedi, the evil Count Dooku (Christopher Lee), the Jedi Council -- led by Jedi Masters Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz) and Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) -- is forced to intervene and thus puts into motion cataclysmic changes for the Republic and its adversaries(n)</desc>
