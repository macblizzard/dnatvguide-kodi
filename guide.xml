George helps with the design and hard graft and investigates the history behind this mysterious half-timber-framed building.(n)</desc>

Haley Graham (Missy Peregrym) is a gifted 17-year-old gymnast with a strong rebellious streak -- strong enough that she walked away from her teammates on the eve of a major international tournament because she'd had enough of the rigid regimentation of Team U.S.A. After experiencing a scrape with the law with her extreme-cycling friends, Haley is given an unusual sentence -- attending the Vickerman Gymnastics Academy, a world-class training facility run by Burt Vickerman (Jeff Bridges), who has led some of the world's greatest gymnasts to championship status. Haley makes no secret of her dislike of life at Vickerman's, and her fellow athletes aren't about to forgive her just yet for letting down her teammates. But while Vickerman makes clear things are to be done his way, he respects Haley's talent, and together she shows him and her new teammates how to follow the rules while still expressing your individuality. Also starring Tarah Paige and Vanessa Lengies, Stick It was the first directorial credit for Jessica Bendinger, who wrote the critically praised teen comedy Bring It On(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Thirteen</title>
    <desc lang="en">Prolific production designer and art director Catherine Hardwicke makes her directorial debut with the coming-of-age drama Thirteen. Los Angeles teenager and overachiever Tracy (Evan Rachel Wood) is an excellent student in her seventh grade class and gets along well with her mother, Melanie (Holly Hunter). She fears that she's not cool enough to be friends with Evie (Nikki Reed), the most popular girl in school. Fueled with genuine adolescent energy, Tracy follows Evie's lead into the harsh realities of sex, drugs, and hard-edged adventure. Consumed with temptations and conflicting desires, Tracy loses her good-girl identity, greatly affecting her relationship with her mom. Partly autobiographical, Thirteen was co-written by Hardwicke and actual 13-year-old Reed, who are close family friends. Originally intending to write a teen comedy, they ended up creating a hard-hitting drama exposing the contemporary teenage experience. Thirteen was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival, with Catherine Hardwicke taking home the Director's Award(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Island of Dr. Moreau</title>
    <desc lang="en">This is the third movie to bring parts of early 20th-century writer H.G. Wells' book The Island of Dr. Moreau to the screen. Earlier versions (1933, 1977) adhered more closely to the story than this one does. Douglas (David Thewlis) is a U.N. peace negotiator who is stranded in the middle of the Pacific Ocean by an airplane crash. He is picked out of the water by Montgomery (Val Kilmer), Dr. Moreau's assistant, and taken to a tropical island. He is at first prevented from straying much beyond the doctor's house and is befriended by Dr. Moreau's daughter (Fairuza Balk). Gradually he discovers that Dr. Moreau (Marlon Brando) has been mixing human and animal genes to create chimeras intended to serve the human race as slaves. The chimeras are not content to serve, however, and the situation unravels from there. One of the film's many lowlights is Ron Perlman as Sayer of the Law in a send-up of Charleton Heston's Moses. Brando and Balk manage to give interesting performances, but for the most part the film is a tedious and unpleasant exercise overwhelmed by garish make-up and animal costuming(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Mean Streets</title>
    <desc lang="en">Mean Streets is the film which cemented the reputation of director Martin Scorsese, launching him to the forefront of American filmmaking. His third feature, this oft-imitated effort establishes many of Scorsese's thematic and stylistic trademarks, including his use of "outsider" heroes, unusual camera and editing techniques, a preoccupation with gangster life, an ongoing fascination with religion and the evocative use of popular music on the movie's soundtrack. Based on Scorsese's own experiences growing up in New York's Little Italy section, the film stars Harvey Keitel as Charlie, the nephew of a local mob boss (Cesare Danova); a deeply religious young man who models his life on the teachings of St. Francis of Assisi, Charlie takes on a reclamation project in the form of Johnny Boy (Robert DeNiro), a young tough whose violent, irrational behavior has landed him in trouble with the local crime lords. Charlie is determined to "save" both Johnny Boy and his epileptic sister Teresa (Amy Robinson) in order to achieve sainthood, but Johnny Boy, a powderkeg waiting to explode, may be beyond salvation(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Taylor (Balthazar Getty) and Ashley (David Arquette) have been best friends since they were boys. They've grown older and stuck together, making a meager living, drifting across the country running low-level cons. They end up in Fairfield, CT, where Ashley thinks they can scam rich lonely housewives. At a children's hockey game, Taylor chats up Karen (Julianna Margulies), who seems to fit their victim profile to a T. She's depressed and unsatisfied in her second marriage. Her teenage daughter from her first marriage, April (Thora Birch), is away at college, and her neglectful, philandering husband is rarely around. Ashley wants Taylor to spend some time with Karen, gain her trust, and case her house for valuables, but the situation gets complicated when Taylor begins to develop genuine feelings for her. Karen soon realizes that Taylor does not offer the solution she seeks to her problems, and ends their affair. Taylor pines for her until he accidentally runs into April. As Taylor and April begin to develop a relationship, the unstable Ashley grows distraught over the state of his partnership with Taylor. Slingshot was written by director Jay Alaimo, producing partner Matt Fiorello, and Matthew Martin (who also has story credit). The film had its world premiere at the 2005 Tribeca Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Taylor (Balthazar Getty) and Ashley (David Arquette) have been best friends since they were boys. They've grown older and stuck together, making a meager living, drifting across the country running low-level cons. They end up in Fairfield, CT, where Ashley thinks they can scam rich lonely housewives. At a children's hockey game, Taylor chats up Karen (Julianna Margulies), who seems to fit their victim profile to a T. She's depressed and unsatisfied in her second marriage. Her teenage daughter from her first marriage, April (Thora Birch), is away at college, and her neglectful, philandering husband is rarely around. Ashley wants Taylor to spend some time with Karen, gain her trust, and case her house for valuables, but the situation gets complicated when Taylor begins to develop genuine feelings for her. Karen soon realizes that Taylor does not offer the solution she seeks to her problems, and ends their affair. Taylor pines for her until he accidentally runs into April. As Taylor and April begin to develop a relationship, the unstable Ashley grows distraught over the state of his partnership with Taylor. Slingshot was written by director Jay Alaimo, producing partner Matt Fiorello, and Matthew Martin (who also has story credit). The film had its world premiere at the 2005 Tribeca Film Festival(n)</desc>

Juno (Ellen Page) may seem wise beyond her years, but after sleeping with classmate Bleeker (Michael Cera), the pregnant teen quickly realizes how little she really knows about life. Thankfully, Juno has been blessed with parents (J.K.

With a little help from Leah, Juno soon comes into contact with Mark (Jason Bateman) and Vanessa (Jennifer Garner) -- an affluent suburban couple who have been unable to conceive a child of their own. Mark and Vanessa seem like they would make great parents, and are eager to adopt Juno's unborn child. Now, as adolescent Juno is faced with a series of very adult decisions, she will draw on the support of her family and friends in order to discover who she truly is, and discover that one bad choice can have a lifetime of consequences(n)</desc>

Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May take three used V8-engined sports cars on a gruelling road trip covering 1,600 miles through Patagonia. Their chosen vehicles are the Porsche 928, Lotus Esprit and Ford Mustang, which are subjected to rigours beyond the scope of their original designs - from tackling swamps and crossing deserts to navigating forests, beaches and ski slopes. Their destination is Ushuaia, the world's southernmost city, where they hope to stage a game of car football against Argentina.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">David Attenborough highlights the curiosities that have led to accusations of forgery, but have ultimately helped assist the rethinking of evolution. When early explorers brought the first specimen of a duck-billed platypus to England in 1799, it was considered so bizarre it was deemed a hoax. Similarly, the midwife toad became the centre of a scientific storm in the 1920s that led to accusations of fakery.(n)</desc>

In the Amazon rainforest, two boys undergo a rite of passage involving hundreds of ants with the most painful stings on Earth, and conservationists in the Grand Canyon try to ensure the survival of one of America's few surviving condor chicks.(n)</desc>

A fisherman in Zambia faces off against crocodiles and risks being swept to his death as he tries to make a living above the imposing Victoria Falls, and in the Amazon, a giant fish offers salvation to a hungry family that calls the river home. A boy's future hangs on the outcome of a single horse race in the vast grasslands of the Steppe, and in a European salt marsh, a young man duels with a savage bull in a centuries-old battle of wills.(n)</desc>

When early explorers brought the first specimen of a duck-billed platypus to England in 1799, it was considered so bizarre it was deemed a hoax. Similarly, the midwife toad became the centre of a scientific storm in the 1920s that led to accusations of fakery.(n)</desc>

Dallas begins his search Down Under, free-diving for lustrous pearls in the waters around north-west Australia and seeking out diamonds from the bottom of the ocean. He also learns about opal mining in one of the most hostile places on Earth and, together with Ellie, reveals how ambergris, a substance that starts life in a sperm whale's stomach, can prove an expensive ingredient in perfume. Plus, how one of the largest and most unusual treasures has helped solve a 67-million-year-old puzzle.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Raw Treasure.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Dallas Campbell and Ellie Harrison present the first of two programmes in which they embark on the ultimate treasure hunt, searching the globe to uncover its extraordinary riches, from natural gems to precious metals - and more besides. Dallas begins his search Down Under, free-diving for lustrous pearls in the waters around north-west Australia and seeking out diamonds from the bottom of the ocean. He also learns about opal mining in one of the most hostile places on Earth and, together with Ellie, reveals how ambergris, a substance that starts life in a sperm whale's stomach, can prove an expensive ingredient in perfume. Plus, how one of the largest and most unusual treasures has helped solve a 67-million-year-old puzzle.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Fever Pitch</title>
    <desc lang="en">Nick Hornby's acclaimed memoir about one man's struggle to balance his love of a woman and his love for soccer was the basis of a well-reviewed British film in 1997, and now gets a Americanized rewrite with this picture, in which the game is changed from soccer to baseball. Ben (Jimmy Fallon) is a high-school teacher who meets Lindsay (Drew Barrymore), who has a successful career in business. Ben and Lindsay don't appear to have much in common on the surface, but they hit it off and are soon involved in a serious romance. But when spring rolls around, Lindsay becomes aware of the true love of Ben's life -- the Boston Red Sox. Despite the team's lamentable record, Ben has been a fiercely loyal Red Sox fan since childhood, and Lindsay finds it hard to compete with his passion for baseball, while Ben is forced to choose between the obsessions of his youth and the enthusiasms of a responsible adult. Fever Pitch was shot in part in Boston during the 2004 baseball season, which to the surprise of the filmmakers saw the Red Sox winning baseball's world series for the first time since 1918(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Raven</title>
    <desc lang="en">Upon discovering that a psychotic serial killer has been using his writings as inspiration, legendary author Edgar Allan Poe (John Cusack) joins forces with a bright, young Baltimore detective to catch the maniac and end his reign of terror. Detective Emmett Fields (Luke Evans) was investigating a vicious murder when he realized the crime scene bore a striking resemblance to a mystery story that was just published in the local newspaper. The author of that ominous tale was Edgar Allan Poe, a brilliant young writer whose status as a social outcast catches the attention of the diligent detective. Shortly after Poe is questioned by the authorities, detectives stumble upon yet another murder scene that seems to have been inspired by the author's morbid writings. Convinced that the killer will once again use Poe's writings as a springboard to murder, Detective Fields recruits the reclusive author to help piece together a pattern to the crimes and stop the madman before he can strike again. Brendan Gleeson and Alice Eve co-star in this tense period thriller from director James McTeigue (V for Vendetta)(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This daily show-biz gossip and "expose" series was a spinoff of the popular interactive website TMZ, an acronym for the "Thirty Mile Zone" surrounding Hollywood. Created in 2005, TMZ had gained national prominence by breaking the story of Mel Gibson's anti-Semitic tirade after his arrest for drunken driving. By the time the TV version of TMZ premiered the week of September 10, 2007, the operation had once again scooped its scandal-rag competition with its coverage of O.J. Simpson's profanity-laden "invasion" of the home of a collectibles dealer who was allegedly selling Simpson memorabilia without permission. In fact, TMZ on TV had a wealth of celebrity-meltdown yarns to choose from during its shakedown week, ranging from the substance-abuse problems of Lindsay Lohan to the ill-fated "comeback" concert of Britney Spears. Harvey Levin, managing editor for both versions of TMZ, appeared on-camera as a correspondent, along with Sean Borg, Michael Hundgen, Katie Darryl and Teresa Strasser. TMZ on TV was seen primarily on local Fox or Fox-owned affiliates throughout the U.S(n)</desc>

Former highbrow children's entertainer and failed criminal genius Sideshow Bob (voice of Kelsey Grammer) has once again won parole, and decides to get revenge against the person who twice put him behind bars: Bart Simpson (voice of Nancy Cartwright). While Bob convinces the authorities that he means no harm to his young nemesis (explaining that his "Die, Bart, Die" tattoo is actually a German expression, "The, Bart, The"), it doesn't take long for Bart to figure out that Bob is the man who's been sending him threatening letters written in blood. After Bob begins stalking Bart and his family, the FBI enrolls the Simpsons in the Witness Relocation Program; renamed the "Thompsons," Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) and Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) move the kids to a houseboat in the riverfront community of Cape Feare. However, Bob manages to hitch a ride on the underside of the family car, and soon Bob is battling Bart "Thompson" mano a mano as the family's home floats down the river. "Cape Feare" first aired on October 7, 1993(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A Star Is Burns. The citizens of Springfield decide they need to spruce up the town's image, and Marge Simpson (voice of Julie Kavner) suggests that sponsoring a Springfield Film Festival might be a good way to do it. The idea is enthusiastically received, and Marge is able to persuade well-known film critic Jay Sherman (voice of Jon Lovitz) to lead the jury. Though overweight and balding, Jay has charm and wit where Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) does not, and after Jay wins over Marge and her sisters, Patty and Selma (both voiced by Julie Kavner), Homer insists on being made a judge for the festival in order to prove his intelligence and sophistication. However, while most of the jury is moved to tears by a film about the tragedy of alcoholism by Barney Gumble (voice of Dan Castellaneta), which bears the unfortunate title "Puke-ahontas," Homer is insistent upon handing the grand prize to a minute-long short in which Hans Moleman (voice of Dan Castellaneta) is hit in the crotch with a football. Meanwhile, C. Montgomery Burns (voice of Harry Shearer) wants to refurbish his image as an aging, cold-hearted energy czar, and decides to make a film about himself, "A Burns for All Seasons," which is to be directed either by Steven Spielberg, or his nonunion Mexican equivalent. "A Star Is Burns" introduced the character of Jay Sherman, who a few weeks later debuted in his own animated series, The Critic, which was produced by several members of the creative team behind The Simpsons. "A Star Is Burns" first aired on March 5, 1995(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Sixteen celebrities enter the Great British Bake Off tent, with four of them battling to be crowned as Comic Relief Star Baker in each programme. Stand-ups Jo Brand and Stephen K Amos and comedy duo Lorna Watson and Ingrid Oliver are the first to compete and must prepare shortbread as their signature bake, tackle a technical challenge of custard slices and finish with a show-stopping portrait cake. Mel Giedroyc presents, with Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood resuming their roles as judges. Plus, Lorraine Pascale reports from Ghana on how the money raised really can change lives.(n)</desc>

He's an alcoholic homeless man huddling inside a box on a dingy London alley with a fellow homeless woman when a couple of criminals start harassing the junkies and the destitute. He reverts to his training, subdues the baddies, and makes a run for it, ending up in the home of a wealthy creative type who happens to be in New York for the next eight months. Smith movies in, cleans himself up, and gets a job as a toughman for a local Asian gangster. Haunted by horrific acts he committed while serving in Afghanistan, he spends much of the money he makes now to help fund a local soup kitchen run by Sister Cristina (Agata Buzek). When the woman he was with at the beginning of the movie turns up dead, Smith decides to hunt down the man responsible. Meanwhile, Cristina questions her own faith, confronts her haunted past, and makes Smith contemplate his own violent nature. Redemption is the feature directorial debut for Knight, who had previously scripted Eastern Promises and Dirty Pretty Things(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Writer/director Steven Knight's Redemption stars Jason Statham as a British Special Forces veteran named Smith who has fallen on very hard times. He's an alcoholic homeless man huddling inside a box on a dingy London alley with a fellow homeless woman when a couple of criminals start harassing the junkies and the destitute. He reverts to his training, subdues the baddies, and makes a run for it, ending up in the home of a wealthy creative type who happens to be in New York for the next eight months. Smith movies in, cleans himself up, and gets a job as a toughman for a local Asian gangster. Haunted by horrific acts he committed while serving in Afghanistan, he spends much of the money he makes now to help fund a local soup kitchen run by Sister Cristina (Agata Buzek). When the woman he was with at the beginning of the movie turns up dead, Smith decides to hunt down the man responsible. Meanwhile, Cristina questions her own faith, confronts her haunted past, and makes Smith contemplate his own violent nature. Redemption is the feature directorial debut for Knight, who had previously scripted Eastern Promises and Dirty Pretty Things(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Lena has just moved to the small, Southern town of Gatlin, where the only person who seems to understand her -- or dream of bigger places or ideas -- is a cute guy named Ethan Wate (Alden Ehrenreich), who recognizes her instantly from the cryptic dreams he's been having every night. Lena is an orphan, and she's come to stay with her mysterious uncle, Macon Ravenwood (Irons), the patriarch of her powerful family. Powerful, because The Ravenwood clan are Casters, born with powers that ordinary mortals don't have, like the ability to move objects, control the elements, and even step out of normal space and time to communicate only with each other. But just as Lena feels ready to open up to Ethan, she discovers that their love is in imminent danger, because when female Casters turn 16, their destiny as either good or evil is revealed. Unwilling to let her nature be dictated by forces outside her control, Lena and Ethan set out together to uncover the strange, secret lore of their families' intertwined histories dating back to the Civil War, and figure out how to grant Lena the power to choose her own destiny(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">When a Vietnam veteran discovers two million dollars while wandering through the aftermath of a Texas drug deal gone horribly awry, his decision to abscond with the cash sets off a violent chain reaction in a stripped-down crime drama from Joel and Ethan Coen.

Upon discovering a bullet-strewn pickup truck surrounded by the corpses of dead bodyguards, Moss uncovers two million dollars in cash and a substantial load of heroin stashed in the back of the vehicle. Later, as an enigmatic killer who determines the fate of his victims with the flip of a coin sets out in pursuit of Moss, the disillusioned Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) struggles to contain the rapidly escalating violence that seems to be consuming his once-peaceful Lone Star State town. Woody Harrelson, Javier Bardem, and Kelly MacDonald co-star in a distinctly American crime story that explores timeless biblical themes in a contemporary Southwestern setting(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">First to Fly.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The veteran naturalist examines the world of flight, travelling across the globe to chart the evolutionary story of those creatures who seemingly defy the rules of gravity by taking to the air. Initially focusing on insects, Attenborough meets a descendant of the dragonfly, before examining the Atlas beetle, which tends to restrict flight to times when it needs a mate or a fresh supply of food. More aesthetically pleasing is a group of beautiful tropical butterflies, followed by an in-depth study into the blow fly - the jet fighter of insects.(n)</desc>

More than 150 years after Charles Darwin formulated his ground-breaking theory of evolution on the remote archipelago, Attenborough explains how life on the islands has continued to evolve in biological isolation, examining how the ever-changing volcanic landscape has given birth to species and sub-species that exist nowhere else in the world. He begins by revealing how Galapagos rose from the ocean four million years ago.(n)</desc>

In the first edition there is spectacular footage of caracals jumping three metres to catch flying birds, and a rare Bornean bay cat, which was thought to have been extinct. Patrick finds out how tigers made the transition from South-east Asia's steamy jungles to the -40C temperatures of Siberia, and meets `lion whisperer' Kevin Richardson.(n)</desc>

In Belize, he mounts an experiment that showcases the margay's supersharp senses and gravity-defying acrobatics, and heads to the training track with a cheetah to find out what speed it is capable of. Finally, Patrick tells the story of the cat's domestication in Essaouira, Morocco, believed to be one of the first places where one particular species first gave up life in the wild in return for food, warmth, security and a home.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Roger Donaldson's bank heist conspiracy-thriller - scripted by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais - stars Jason Statham as the leader of a gang of thieves who bite off more than they can chew. When car dealer and one-time crook Terry Leather is approached by his old flame Martine Love with a proposition that would put his money worries behind him for good, he jumps at the chance. Leather quickly assembles a team which digs a tunnel directly into a London bank's vault. But what he hasn't been told is that, in addition to the money, he'll also be stealing a safety box containing material that, if it saw the light of day, would be extremely damaging to the royal family. Another box they take holds further dramatic revelations concerning establishment figures. So it's not long before Leather and the gang are pursued by the police, MI5 and various thugs, all keen to get their hands on the incendiary information..(n)</desc>

Each have their different reasons for setting out into the unknown. But having survived volcanoes and hungry hippo attacks, nothing could have prepared them for the greatest danger - a troop of intelligent killer apes who, as one critic wrote, '...make King Kong look like the Jolly Green Giant'. Based on Michael Crichton's bestseller, Marshall's film is great fun, with wonderful cliff-hanging moments and, in Linney's character, one who can out-tough Indiana Jones any day(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Independent filmmaker Chris Kentis directs the dramatic thriller Open Water, based on a true story. Susan (Blanchard Ryan) and Daniel (Daniel Travis) are a busy married couple on an island vacation. They board a vessel called the Reef Explorer with a group of other scuba divers, traveling 15 miles out to sea. Since they are certified to dive in open waters, the couple breaks off from the group to go exploring. The Reef Explorer accidentally leaves without a proper head count, leaving them stranded in shark-infested waters. Kentis and producer wife Laura Lau did all the filming themselves in the actual ocean without extraneous special effects, while the actors wore special steel-mesh under their wetsuits in the scenes where actual sharks were involved. Open Water was shown at the Sundance Film Festival in 2004 as part of the American Spectrum competition(n)</desc>

Based on Michael Crichton's bestseller, Marshall's film is great fun, with wonderful cliff-hanging moments and, in Linney's character, one who can out-tough Indiana Jones any day(n)</desc>

They board a vessel called the Reef Explorer with a group of other scuba divers, traveling 15 miles out to sea. Since they are certified to dive in open waters, the couple breaks off from the group to go exploring. The Reef Explorer accidentally leaves without a proper head count, leaving them stranded in shark-infested waters. Kentis and producer wife Laura Lau did all the filming themselves in the actual ocean without extraneous special effects, while the actors wore special steel-mesh under their wetsuits in the scenes where actual sharks were involved. Open Water was shown at the Sundance Film Festival in 2004 as part of the American Spectrum competition(n)</desc>

Fifteen years ago, an elusive serial killer known as The Wolf claimed the lives of 15 young girls. Thanks to the work of Detectives Elliott Carbon (John Rhys-Davies) and Johnny Morgan ( Andrew Cymek), The Wolf was eventually captured, locked up, and placed in the care of Dr. Parker (William B. Davis). When the facility loses power and the lights go dark, however, The Wolf and the rest of the inmates seize the opportunity to reclaim their freedom. Now trapped in these winding corridors with a rampaging gang of maniacs, madmen, and murderers, Johnny and Dr. Parker must fight to survive the night, and ensure that no one escapes before order is restored(n)</desc>

Ignatz, the patriarch rises from poverty to become a prominent judge and model conservative. But his prosperity proves short-lived, since he must eventually confront the changing attitudes of the Hungarian majority. Ignatz is torn when his government sanctions Jewish persecutions, something that creates a rift between him and his beloved wife Valerie (played alternately by veteran actress Rosemary Harris and her daughter Jennifer Ehle), while his brother Gustave, fearful of the growing anti-semitic feeling, throws himself into Communism instead. His son Adam (also played by Fiennes) converts to Christianity to advance his career as a champion fencer and Olympic hero, but finds his patriotism rejected as he is inexorably caught up in the Holocaust. Finally, Istvan (Fiennes again), his grandson, who must constantly change his allegiances in order to survive the war, revolution, loss and betrayal, realizes that his ultimate loyalty must be to his family, his heritage, and himself(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Kathryn Bigelow's compelling fact-based, Iraq-set bomb disposal drama was scripted by journalist Mark Boal, drawing on his experiences while embedded with a United States Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal team in 2004. The focus is on the complex characters making up Bravo Company, who disable and destroy improvised explosive devices. The days are ticking down to the end of the bomb squad's tour, but their role puts the team in harm's way around the clock. And it doesn't help that one of the team is addicted to risk taking and pays scant attention to standard procedure, putting other lives in danger, as well as his own. The Hurt Locker provides a tense glimpse into the lives of these extraordinary men, and also probes the various psychologies of people whose job could kill them at any moment, as well as - briefly - exploring how they cope once away from their adrenaline-soaked vocation(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Hurt Locker</title>
    <desc lang="en">Kathryn Bigelow's compelling fact-based, Iraq-set bomb disposal drama was scripted by journalist Mark Boal, drawing on his experiences while embedded with a United States Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal team in 2004. The focus is on the complex characters making up Bravo Company, who disable and destroy improvised explosive devices. The days are ticking down to the end of the bomb squad's tour, but their role puts the team in harm's way around the clock. And it doesn't help that one of the team is addicted to risk taking and pays scant attention to standard procedure, putting other lives in danger, as well as his own. The Hurt Locker provides a tense glimpse into the lives of these extraordinary men, and also probes the various psychologies of people whose job could kill them at any moment, as well as - briefly - exploring how they cope once away from their adrenaline-soaked vocation(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">An entrepreneur with a world-class ego has to rebuild his empire and his family relationships from scratch in this comedy. Robert Axle (Kevin Spacey) built a multi-million-dollar business out of selling household gadgets through television infomercials, and managed to alienate nearly everyone around him when fame and wealth turned him into an arrogant loudmouth. When one of Axle's products turns out to be dangerous and causes several thousand customers to lose a finger, he loses his fortune and spends eight years in prison for gross negligence. Back on the street, Axle is broke but determined to find a way back to the top, though he's just a bit more humble than he used to be and wants to win back the love of his daughter, Claire (Camilla Belle), whom he neglected as a child, and his ex-wife (Virginia Madsen). Things go badly for Axle on his first day working at a big-box discount store, and he's left with little alternative than to ask Claire to let him stay with her; she and her roommate, Fibbi (Heather Graham), aren't so sure this is a good idea, but they grudgingly agree and end up helping Axle in his bid to redeem himself.

    <title lang="en">Killer Joe</title>
    <desc lang="en">A desperate Texas drug dealer plots to settle a sizable debt by killing his mother and collecting the insurance money, but gets into an even bigger mess after hiring a twisted police detective who moonlights as a killer-for-hire to get the job done. Chris (Emile Hirsch) is in serious trouble. He's just incurred a major debt to Digger Soames (Marc Macaulay), and when you're late paying Digger, you can wind up dead. His back against the wall, Chris comes to his father Ansel (Thomas Haden Church) with a sinister proposition: they'll hire a killer to get rid of Chris' mother (and Ansel's ex-wife), then collect the insurance money that will go to Chris' teenage sister Dottie (Juno Temple), a seraphic sleepwalker who seems to exist in a world all her own. Bringing Chris' temperamental stepmother Sharla (Gina Gershon) in on the hustle, the young deadbeat and his dimwitted father enlist the services of Joe Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a local police detective whose authority and detailed knowledge of police procedures make him the perfect hired killer. But Joe doesn't come cheap, and when his fee proves bigger than expected, Chris and Ansel agree to let him have Dottie as a "retainer" until the insurance check clears. Just when it starts to look as if everything is going according to plan, however, an unexpected complication plunges the entire situation into total chaos. A lurid black comedy that goes to some very dark places, Killer Joe is the second collaboration between acclaimed director William Friedkin and playwright/screenwriter Tracy Letts, who previously worked together on the 2006 psychological thriller Bug(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Actor, writer, and director Tim Blake Nelson adapts this grim look at the Holocaust from his own play, based on Miklós Nyiszli's book, Auschwitz: A Doctor's Eyewitness Account. The film centers on the Sonderkommando: Jewish concentration camp prisoners whose job was to herd their fellow Jews into the gas chamber, and to dispose of the bodies following the execution. In return, these prisoners received food and a little more time before their own executions. As the members of the sonderkommando struggle to orchestrate what would be the only armed insurrection in Auschwitz, a group of them discover a 14-year-old girl who somehow survived the gas chamber. The girl becomes a symbol for their own spiritual salvation and they become obsessed with keeping the girl alive, even if it endangers the uprising that could save thousands. This film was screened at the 2001 Toronto Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In this darkly comic tale of love and infidelity, Carla (Heather Graham) and Lou (Natasha Gregson Wagner) are both waiting outside an brownstone in Soho and happen to strike up a conversation. It seems both of them are waiting to meet their respective boyfriends, and as they discuss the bright, funny, romantic and monogamous men they've been lucky enough to become involved with, they make a surprising discovery -- they're both waiting for the same man, Blake (Robert Downey Jr.), an actor, musician and compulsive womanizer. As they compare notes on the man they've been unknowingly sharing and what they should do about the situation, Blake arrives and quickly starts trying to talk his way out of the disastrous situation. Writer and director James Toback claims he was inspired to write this project for Robert Downey Jr. after seeing a news report showing him in jail after violating parole regarding an arrest for drugs; Two Girls and a Guy was written in four days and shot in eleven days on a single set, and features excellent performances from Downey, Graham, and Wagner(n)</desc>

Up in Smoke, produced and directed by Lou Alder is Cheech and Chong's first and best film(n)</desc>

With the arrogance of inexperience, Katell demands that Sgt. Causarano (Albert Salmi) lead an attack against a group of wounded and dispirited Japanese soldiers -- "They are the enemy! First day of the war or the last day of the war!" But a sudden wrinkle in time causes Lt. Katell -- or should we say "Lt. Yamuri" -- to experience an epiphany. Future Star Trek stalwart Leonard Nimoy plays a small role as a radio operator. Scripted by Rod Serling from an idea by Sam Rolfe (Have Gun, Will Travel, Man from U.N.C.L.E. et al.), "A Quality of Mercy" was Twilight Zone's Yuletide offering for the 1961-62 season, making its first appearance on December 29, 1961(n)</desc>

This he does by reporting tragic incidents that haven't happened yet -- and then making certain that they do happen.

Larry Blyden stars in this hilarious Twilight Zone entry as egocentric TV western star Rance McGrew, who, while filming a fight scene, is knocked cold by a prop bottle. Upon awakening, Rance finds himself in the real west, circa 1880 -- and at the mercy of none other than Jesse James (Arch Johnson). It seems that old Jesse isn't too thrilled as to how he and his fellow outlaws have been depicted on Rance's series, and he intends to teach the vainglorious actor a lesson. Best line: "And you won an Emmy ? Shoot, you can't act any better than you can draw!" This episode reunited two alumni of the classic 1951 sci-fi thriller The Thing: actor Robert Cornthwaite, and director Christian Nyby. Scripted by Rod Serling from an idea by Frederic Louis Fox (which in its original form wasn't a comedy at all), "Showdown with Rance McGrew" first aired February 2, 1962(n)</desc>

Out of earshot of Jenny's harridan guardian Mrs. Gann (Nancy Kulp), Old Ben confesses that he is a fugitive from a distant planet, an assertion that seems to be verified when he miraculously heals Jenny's leg.

    <sub-title lang="en">The Gift</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The Gift. Released just in time for Easter on April 27, 1962, this Rod Serling-scripted Twilight Zone episode is widely regarded as the series' low point. A ham-handed Christ parable, the story is set in a backward Mexican village, where the arrival of a mysterious stranger named Williams (Geoffrey Horne) brings out the superstitious worst in the local citizenry. Only little Pedro (Edmund Vargas) and the town's doctor (Nico Minardos) refuse to regard Williams as a threat, but they are shouted down by a hostile mob, leading to a painfully obvious climax that wouldn't have gotten past "Creative Writing 101." The sole redeeming virtue of "The Gift" was its classical guitar score by the great Laurindo Almeida(n)</desc>

While Fletcher seeks only to befriend the local citizens, the arrogant, power-hungry Craig is perfectly content to be worshipped as a god. Ordering Fletcher back into the spaceship, Craig stays behind, looking forward to a long and fruitful reign over the little people. . .a reign that comes to an abrupt end in a most ironic fashion.

Decked out in coke-bottle glasses and greased-down hair, Theodore Bikel is malevolence personified as Oliver Crangle, a self-appointed "social conscience" who spends all his waking hours persecuting innocent people whom he has designated as evil. After casually ruining several lives, this Crangle declares that he has in his possession the means to shrink all evil people in the world to a height of two feet -- and that this metamorphosis will occur exactly at Four O'Clock. Appearing as Crangle's landlady is Moyna McGill, the actress mother of Angela Lansbury. "Four O'Clock" was first telecast on April 6, 1962(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">I Sing the Body Electric</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">I Sing the Body Electric. Though he'd originally intended to write several scripts for the original Twilight Zone, Ray Bradbury's sole contribution to the series was this sensitive adaptation of his own short story "I Sing the Body Electric!" Hoping to fill the void left by the death of his wife, a widower (David White) takes his children to Robots Unlimited to purchase an "electric grandmother" for the kids. The younger children (Charles Herbert) and Dana Dillaway) are delighted with their robot granny (Josephine Hutchinson), but older daughter Anna (Veronica Cartwright) is sullen and resentful -- until "Grandma" proves herself to be more human than most humans. Though the episode is generally successful, no one connected with it was satisfied, least of all director James Sheldon, who felt that star Josephine Hutchinson was not quite right in the leading role. In addition, an earlier scene with June Vincent as the kids' aunt Nedra didn't "play" on film, necessitating an expensive reshoot, directed by William F. Claxton, with Doris Packer replacing Vincent. All in all, however, "I Sing the Body Electric!" pleased the crowd when it first aired on May 18, 1962, though a much-later 60-minute TV version, "The Electric Grandmother" (1980), was closer to the spirit of the Bradbury original(n)</desc>

Things get dicey when one of the "boys" (Lee Kinsolving) falls in love with Earthling Ellen Tillman (Shelley Fabares). In his haste to come up with an intriguing gimmick, Twilight Zone scripter Earl Hamner failed to answer a vital question -- if the three invaders hoped to blend in and avoid drawing attention to their activities, why did they dress up like second-rate Marlon Brandos? Denver Pyle, Irene Hervey, and Michael Conrad play key supporting roles in "Black Leather Jackets," which originally aired January 31, 1964(n)</desc>

This includes an abundance of loud noises -- whistles, bells, cannon shots, and military music -- because Flemington, like nature, abhors a vaccuum. His obsession with noise costs Flemington his wife (Penny Singleton) and his sanity, though not necessarily in that order. Written Rod Serling, "Sounds and Silences" was networkcast only once, on April 3, 1964; because of a legal squabble with another writer, the episode was removed from the Twilight Zone syndicated package, remaining unseen until 1984, when it was included in a two-hour Twilight Zone anniversary package(n)</desc>

What he doesn't know is that the instrument for death is hidden in his room -- a booby-trapped telephone.

Without saying any more, we can note that the supporting cast includes Sheppard Strudwick and Michael Fox; also appearing is a cute child actress named Suzanne Cupito, who enjoyed a substantial adult career under the name Morgan Brittany. Scripted by Rod Serling and graced with a subtly sinister musical score by Jerry Goldsmith, "Nightmare as a Child" was the April 29, 1960, installment of Twilight Zone(n)</desc>

Archie Taylor (Franchot Tone) decides to place a most unusual wager. With $500,000 at stake, Taylor bets that Tennyson cannot remain silent for a full year. Deeply in debt, Tennyson accepts the wager, and even permits himself to be placed in a glass cage in the club's basement, so that Taylor and the other members can monitor his silence. Though the story contains no science-fiction or fantasy trappings whatsover, the ironic ending is very much in keeping with the standards set by previous Twilight Zone episodes. First telecast April 28, 1961, "The Silence" was scripted by Rod Serling -- and though Serling denied it at the time, the story would seem to have been influenced by Anton Chekhov's "The Bet."(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Time Enough at Last</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Time Enough at Last. In his first Twilight Zone appearance, Burgess Meredith stars as Henry Bemis, a miopic bank clerk who wants nothing more out of life than to be left alone to read his precious books. He unexpectedly gets his wish when, while hiding in a bank vault with a book in his hands, a hydrogen bomb devastates the city around him. The sole survivor of this nuclear attack, Henry is at first stricken with panic, then becomes delighted at the prospect of reading to his heart's content, without being nagged by his wife (Jacqueline De Wit) or his boss (Vaughn Taylor). The episode's ironic payoff is so well known that it does not bear repeating here; suffice to say that the ending was invoked in the first few moments of 1983's Twilight Zone: The Movie. First telecast November 20, 1959, "Time Enough at Last" was scripted by Rod Serling from a short story by Lynn Venable(n)</desc>

Alas, the psychiatrist's nurse is the spitting image of the woman in Hall's nightmares. Superbly directed by Robert Florey and boasting an eerie musical score by Nathan Van Cleave, "Perchance to Dream" is enough to give anyone nightmares(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">And When the Sky Was Opened. Richard Matheson was first represented on the Twilight Zone with the December 11, 1959 episode "And When the Sky Was Opened," adapted by Rod Serling from Matheson's short story "Disappearing Act." After an experimental space flight crash-lands, the three crew members -- who have miraculously survived -- begin experiencing strange sensations. As the episode develops, it becomes obvious that no one but the crewmen have any memory of the crash. . .and before long, no one has any memory whatsoever of the crew itself! This tricky, complex set-up was brilliantly handled by director Douglas Heyes (making his own Twilight Zone debut) and by a topnotch cast, including Rod Taylor, Jim Hutton, and Charles Aidman as the benighted astronauts (also, keep an eye out for Sue Randall, aka "Miss Landers" on Leave It to Beaver(n)</desc>
