    <desc lang="en">Documentary shedding light on whether there is any truth to conspiracy theorists' suggestions that London and Washington had been aware the Japanese were planning to assault the American naval base at Pearl Harbour in 1941, but refused to act on the intelligence as part of a plot to bring the full might of America's military into the Second World War. In the wake of the attack, an investigation into how US forces failed to anticipate the assault concluded that Admiral Husband Kimmel, Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet, had been guilty of dereliction of duty, a charge that left his career in tatters. Making use of new research into a top-secret US military project, as well as thousands of freshly unearthed documents, letters and photographs, this film aims to answer - once and for all - whether the brutal attack that claimed nearly 2,500 lives could have been prevented.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Nightmare Neighbour Next Door</title>
    <desc lang="en">The documentary focuses on two residential disputes that escalated from complaints about noise-making to far more serious quarrels. Warren and Sharee detail how their peaceful lives in a quiet Birmingham suburb were ruined when new neighbour Harry moved in. Harry complained of noise the pair knew wasn't coming from their household, an accusation he would level more than once, and with increasing intensity. Finally, when the hostile Harry pulled out a gun and threatened the couple over their garden fence, they were forced to sell up and move out. However, even after relocating, it seemed their nightmare was not over. Also featured is the story of Jill, who was just a teenager when Barry, who lived with his parents next-door, became fixated on her family making a racket. Brushing off the grievance, Jill and her relatives tried to get on with their lives, but one autumn day the feud took a tragic, life-changing turn.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Hollywood Ending</title>
    <desc lang="en">A down-on-his luck auteur gets one more chance at the big time -- provided his neuroses don't swallow him whole -- in Woody Allen's 33rd feature release, Hollywood Ending. Allen plays Val Waxman, a one-time cinematic genius who's resorted to taking advertisement work to pay the bills for himself and his airhead live-in girlfriend, Lori (Debra Messing). Val finds his luck is about to change, however, when he receives the script for The City Never Sleeps , a period noir set against the backdrop of 1940s New York City. It seems his ex-wife, Ellie (Tea Leoni), now an executive at Galaxy Pictures, has been pulling for him to direct the picture, claiming he's the only man who can do justice to the script. She even manages to convince her boyfriend, Hal (Treat Williams), Galaxy's high-powered studio head, to take a chance on Val's "unique vision." Just when the cameras are ready to roll, however, Val finds that unique vision in jeopardy -- literally -- as he's struck with a psychosomatic case of blindness. When physicians and psychiatrists fail to cure him, Val contrives a scheme to forge ahead with the picture, for fear of blowing his one last chance at greatness. Hollywood Ending co-stars George Hamilton and Mark Rydell(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Astronaut Farmer</title>
    <desc lang="en">An aspiring astronaut who was forced to forsake his dream of exploring space in order to save the family farm begins building his own personal rocket as a means of reaching the stars in this quirky rural drama starring Billy Bob Thornton. There once was a time when Charlie Farmer (Thornton) seemed like a shoo-in for NASA's esteemed astronaut training program. An Air Force pilot who held a degree in aerospace engineering, Charlie was well on his way to blasting off when a family crisis grounded his celestial aspirations. Of course, Charlie's feet may be firmly planted on terra firma these days, but his thoughts are constantly ascending into the clouds and beyond. It's been ten long years since the man who would navigate the stars began tending to the family farm, and during that time, Charlie has dedicated every moment of his spare time to building the rocket that will one day launch him into space. Though his devoted wife, Audie (Virginia Madsen), the pair's three children, Sunshine, Stanley, and Shepard, and even his father-in-law, Hal (Bruce Dern), all support Charlie in achieving his lifelong goal of becoming the nation's first independent astronaut, a last-minute hitch on the eve before the big launch unexpectedly stalls Charlie's countdown. It seems that Charlie's quest to obtain a substantial amount of high-grade rocket fuel has attracted the attention of not only the FBI, but the CIA, the FAA, and the United States military as well. Now, as the powers that be attempt to ground Charlie, citing concerns for civilian safety, a media frenzy descends upon the once-quiet farm as the reluctant renegade hero vows to show his children just how far one's courage and willingness to pursue one's own ideals can get a person when one refuses to give up hope. Northfork writing/directing duo Mark and Michael Polish team up to tell the tale of a man considered an oddity by his neighbors, a criminal by the government, and an inspiration by the media and the people(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Unfaithful</title>
    <desc lang="en">Diane Lane is a wayward wife and Richard Gere is her suspicious husband in Adrian Lyne's Unfaithful. Connie (Lane) leaves her suburban home on an errand, venturing into Manhattan during a wicked windstorm. On a trash-strewn Soho street, she literally runs into Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez), a handsome young Frenchman carrying a huge stack of books. Connie has a bad scrape on her knee, and is unable to get a cab, so Paul invites her up to his apartment. Paul is quietly flirtatious as he gives Connie some ice and a bandage for her knee. Connie phones home and explains to her son, Charlie (Erik Per Sullivan), that she's running late. Before she leaves, Paul gives her a book of Persian poetry, The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. She mentions the encounter in passing to Edward (Gere), her husband, but it's clear that she's obsessing about Paul, and soon she's back in the city, with a pretext for calling him up. Soon, they are lovers, and they grow bolder and bolder in their passion. Edward begins to suspect, and eventually gets a private investigator (Dominic Chianese of The Sopranos) to follow Connie. His worst fears confirmed, Edward decides to confront Paul, a decision that will come to haunt him. While the screenplay for Unfaithful is credited to Alvin Sargent (Ordinary People) and William Broyles Jr. (Cast Away), the inspiration for Lyne's film came from Claude Chabrol's acclaimed 1969 film La Femme Infidele(n)</desc>

Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez star as Alice and Rain, two members of a commando team assigned to infiltrate the Hive, an underground research laboratory owned by the faceless conglomerate known as the Umbrella Corporation. A bio-engineered virus has been released into the maze-like Hive, turning the facility's employees into mindless, flesh-eating zombies. A single scratch or bite from one of these rampaging ghouls dooms its victim, so the commandos have their work cut out for them as they attempt to reach the Red Queen, the lab's supercomputer -- and their sole hope of halting the spread of the contagion. Before they can complete their mission, however, the soldiers must overcome a variety of deadly obstacles, including mutant dogs, lasers, and a genetically altered beast known as The Licker, whose strength increases with every victim it slays. Alice and Rain also discover that the release of the virus may not have been an accident, and that a cure may exist somewhere in the deadly Hive. Resident Evil co-stars Eric Mabius, James Purefoy, Martin Crewes, and Colin Salmon(n)</desc>

The tertiary episode of this series, "Landing the Eagle," spans the years 1966-1969; it commences on a heart-rending note, with one of NASA's earliest disasters - the fire that immolated the pressurized Apollo 1 capsule, ending the lives of Virgil "Gus" Grissom and two other men - and then waxes triumphant by moving into such seminal events as the Saturn V rocket launch and the famous moonwalk by Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong on July 20, 1969(n)</desc>

The Discovery Channel's cutting-edge documentary miniseries When We Left Earth systematically (and chronologically) weaves the tale of the American Space Race, from the immediate post-WWII years into the early 20th century. The fourth episode of this series, "The Explorers," continues where the prior Apollo-themed installment left off, by visiting a crisis that nearly befell the space program in April 1970. In that now-famous series of events (later immortalized by Ron Howard's 1995 film), a series of astronauts including Fred Haise, Jim Lovell and Jack Swiegert found themselves trapped in a damaged Apollo spacecraft, faced with the slim prospect of returning the vehicle to Earth. The episode touches on their heroic success, then moves ahead into a discussion of additional moon missions during the early 1970s, and the launch and repair of Skylab, which required a never-before-done repair outside of the spacecraft in mid-orbit(n)</desc>

In Brazil, he swims with them, inciting the piranhas into a feeding frenzy, and also tracks down survivors and eyewitnesses of piranha attacks. In one incident from 1976, 39 people died when a coach crashed into the river and some bodies were so badly mutilated that they could only be identified by their clothes. Is this proof that piranhas do live up to their fearsome reputation?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Richard Hammond presents this chilly version of Total Wipeout, which sees the contestants wrapping up warm to tackle a snow-covered course with winter-themed obstacles and seasonal challenges. They must manoeuvre themselves past Granny's House, watching out for the angry dog nipping at their ankles and a front door guaranteed to smack them in the face. They then cling onto the ski lift to avoid plunging into the icy waters, before riding the conveyor belt that throws them onto those old Wipeout favourites, the big red balls. Amanda Byram laughs it up at the side of the course.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Resident Evil</title>
    <desc lang="en">The director of Mortal Kombat (1995) adapts another popular video game for the big screen with this gory action thriller. Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez star as Alice and Rain, two members of a commando team assigned to infiltrate the Hive, an underground research laboratory owned by the faceless conglomerate known as the Umbrella Corporation. A bio-engineered virus has been released into the maze-like Hive, turning the facility's employees into mindless, flesh-eating zombies. A single scratch or bite from one of these rampaging ghouls dooms its victim, so the commandos have their work cut out for them as they attempt to reach the Red Queen, the lab's supercomputer -- and their sole hope of halting the spread of the contagion. Before they can complete their mission, however, the soldiers must overcome a variety of deadly obstacles, including mutant dogs, lasers, and a genetically altered beast known as The Licker, whose strength increases with every victim it slays. Alice and Rain also discover that the release of the virus may not have been an accident, and that a cure may exist somewhere in the deadly Hive. Resident Evil co-stars Eric Mabius, James Purefoy, Martin Crewes, and Colin Salmon(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The duo restore a Fiat 500, which was Italy's answer to the Mini when it was launched in July 1957 and marketed as a cheap, practical and fuel-efficient town car. Bernie Fineman immediately puts Mario Pacione's nose out of joint by spending £1,500 on a bright orange wreck that will not even start and makes matters worse by laying out another £2,000 behind his back to coax an extra six brake horsepower out of the 500cc engine. Former racing driver Paul O'Neill judges their efforts and decides whether Bernie's improvements make the difference between a profit and a loss. Plus, the car's history is charted through archive footage, revealing what inspired the designers and why their creation was such a success.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Anna Maxwell Martin, Matthew Rhys and Jenna Coleman star in this sequel to Pride and Prejudice, adapted from the best-selling novel by PD James, which brings Jane Austen's world back to life in a highly original way - with a murder mystery plot at its centre. The drama picks up six years on from the marriage of Elizabeth and Darcy, as the couple prepare for the lavish annual ball at their magnificent Pemberley home. However, the unannounced arrival of Elizabeth's wayward sister Lydia brings the event to an abrupt halt when she stumbles in screaming that her husband, Wickham, has been murdered. Darcy leads a search party out to the woodlands and finds a blood-soaked corpse - but it's not the body they were expecting to find. Trevor Eve, Rebecca Front, James Fleet and Matthew Goode co-star.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Elizabeth remains aggrieved at Darcy's treatment of Georgiana, but her immediate concern is for her sister Lydia, whose husband's indiscretions and secrets look likely to come to light during his trial for the murder of Captain Denny. As the court case progresses, Darcy realises his preoccupation with Pemberley has served to distance himself from both his wife and his sister, and he reaches out to the pair of them.

    <title lang="en">He's Just Not That Into You</title>
    <desc lang="en">Kevin Kwapis's romantic comedy is based on a self-help book that shares the film's title, which itself was inspired by an episode of Sex and the City. The plot concerns the relationships of a multiplicity of Baltimore residents, but centres around Gigi's (Ginnifer Goodwin) long-thwarted search for love. And when she asks her local barman Alex (Justin Long) why men never seem to call her back after a date, his answer turns her understanding of romance upside down. Meanwhile, Janine (Jennifer Connelly) seems to be more interested in working on her house than her marriage to Ben (Bradley Cooper), who in turn strays with yoga teacher Anna (Scarlett Johansson); and Beth (Jennifer Aniston) is having trouble persuading her long-term boyfriend Neil (Ben Affleck) to marry her. The all-star cast also includes Drew Barrymore, Kevin Connolly and Kris Kristofferson(n)</desc>

In the neighbouring Namib desert, which receives almost no rain, the competition for scant resources can be fierce, as proven by a ferocious fight for supremacy between two giraffes.(n)</desc>

Through all the hard times, Hannah has been the one constant in Tom's life, and the one person he knows he can always rely on. When Hannah leaves on a business trip to Scotland, Tom is surprised to realise how truly lonely he is without her, so the moment she returns, Tom resolves to ask for her hand in marriage.

With his spirits crushed but his love for Hannah stronger than ever before, Tom reluctantly agrees to be the "maid" of honour so that he can prove his love in no uncertain terms and convince her to call off the wedding before true happiness slips through his fingers(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This daily show-biz gossip and "expose" series was a spinoff of the popular interactive website TMZ, an acronym for the "Thirty Mile Zone" surrounding Hollywood. Created in 2005, TMZ had gained national prominence by breaking the story of Mel Gibson's anti-Semitic tirade after his arrest for drunken driving. By the time the TV version of TMZ premiered the week of September 10, 2007, the operation had once again scooped its scandal-rag competition with its coverage of O.J. Simpson's profanity-laden "invasion" of the home of a collectibles dealer who was allegedly selling Simpson memorabilia without permission. In fact, TMZ on TV had a wealth of celebrity-meltdown yarns to choose from during its shakedown week, ranging from the substance-abuse problems of Lindsay Lohan to the ill-fated "comeback" concert of Britney Spears. Harvey Levin, managing editor for both versions of TMZ, appeared on-camera as a correspondent, along with Sean Borg, Michael Hundgen, Katie Darryl and Teresa Strasser.

After 15 years of working with aliens from all across the cosmos, Agent J is sure he's seen it all. But just when he's getting the hang of the game, he learns that history has inexplicably been rewritten. In this new timeline of events, Agent K has been dead for 40 years, and Earth will soon come under attack from an extraterrestrial force with the power to claim the entire planet. Now, in order to set the past straight and head off an invasion of epic proportions, Agent J must travel back to the year 1969, when Young Agent K (Josh Brolin) was just a fresh new face on the force. But Agent J only has 24 hours to find the source of the coming catastrophe and discern how his longtime partner ties into the situation -- should he fail he'll be stuck in the past forever. Jemaine Clement, Alice Eve, and Emma Thompson co-star(n)</desc>

After 15 years of working with aliens from all across the cosmos, Agent J is sure he's seen it all. But just when he's getting the hang of the game, he learns that history has inexplicably been rewritten. In this new timeline of events, Agent K has been dead for 40 years, and Earth will soon come under attack from an extraterrestrial force with the power to claim the entire planet. Now, in order to set the past straight and head off an invasion of epic proportions, Agent J must travel back to the year 1969, when Young Agent K (Josh Brolin) was just a fresh new face on the force. But Agent J only has 24 hours to find the source of the coming catastrophe and discern how his longtime partner ties into the situation -- should he fail he'll be stuck in the past forever.

    <desc lang="en">Jesse Eisenberg stars in the triple-Oscar-winning fictionalised account of the tetchy story behind Facebook's birth. Directed by David Fincher, it was inspired by Ben Mezrich's book The Accidental Billionaires and written by Aaron Sorkin, the sharp wordsmith of television's The West Wing. The gripping drama kicks off with neurotic Harvard computer science student Mark Zuckerberg drunkenly creating a misogynistic website called Facemash in revenge for being dumped by his girlfriend Erica. Once the hangover has worn off, Zuckerberg realises he may have the germ of a nifty idea, as long as he shifts the focus from settling scores to social interaction. Events unfold partly through chronological flashback and partly via later courtroom testimony, as the tale of friendships and business partnerships made and broken is told from the points of view of those involved. Sorkin's smart, humorous script propels the film with a kinetic energy. Also starring Andrew Garfield, Armie Hammer and Justin Timberlake(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Cinema icon Al Pacino joins a powerhouse cast headed by of George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, and series newcomer Ellen Barkin for this, the third installment of director Steven Soderbergh's popular series of glitzy crime comedies. The only hotelier in Las Vegas who can claim that each and every one of his establishments has earned the Royal Review Board's Five Diamond Award, Willy Bank (Pacino) has made more than his share of enemies during his impressive ascent. While most of Bank's adversaries amount to little more than the occasional nuisance, however, this powerful player is about to find out that picking your enemies in Las Vegas can be a true gamble. In betraying Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould), Bank has finally crossed the one man who could bring his entire empire crumbling to the ground -- Danny Ocean (Clooney). Now Reuben is in critical condition, and Ocean is determined to strike back at the man who nearly murdered his mentor. Bank may have taken down one of the original Ocean's Eleven, but his efforts only managed to unite the remaining ten closer than ever before. As the opening of Bank's newest casino draws near, Danny and the crew set into motion a bold plan to humiliate the cocksure casino owner and forever tarnish his spotless reputation. It won't be easy, but if Ocean and his team can get their elaborate plan together in time for the opening of The Bank, they just might be able to deliver some serious Las Vegas justice(n)</desc>

He has abandoned his feisty wife Bobbi (Daryl Hannah) and young daughter to set off on a nine-month road odyssey with his manager Lester Irving (Garrett Morris), in an effort to collect cash at local karaoke gigs. Lester grooms Sunny by choosing what songs he will do, keeping up with what the judges are like, and negotiating with competitors like Sammy Bones (Mac Davis), another traveling hopeful.

    <title lang="en">The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl</title>
    <desc lang="en">Writer and director Robert Rodriguez returns to the family-friendly adventure of his Spy Kids movies with this three-dimensional action opus. Max (Cayden Boyd) is a ten-year-old boy who doesn't get along with his peers and is constantly bullied at school. But Max has an active imagination, and he has a pair of very special imaginary playmates -- Shark Boy (Taylor Lautner), a human-shark half-breed cared for by a pack of great whites, and Lava Girl (Taylor Dooley), a girl with superpowers who can conjure heat and fire at will. Max may be a creative boy, but what he doesn't know is that Shark Boy and Lava Girl really do exist, and he is recruited to help them as they do battle against Mr. Electricity, a super-villain determined to deprive children of their sleep. Shot and originally released in the 3-D format, The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl also stars David Arquette and Kristin Davis as Max's parents, and George Lopez as a schoolteacher; writer and director Rodriguez wrote the film's story in collaboration with his then seven-year-old son, Racer Rodriguez(n)</desc>

Given to telling whoppers, Thomas finds himself in a boy-who-cried-wolf dilemma when he overhears two spies plotting to smuggle valuable info out of the US. When he can't get his own father Dabney Coleman to believe him, Thomas turns disconsolately to a computer game called "Cloak and Dagger" and begins to fantasize, imagining that he is in cahoots with secret agent Jack Flack, also played by Coleman. Finally coming to grips with the fact that the mythical Jack Flack cannot help him this time, Thomas takes on the spies with the help of his schoolmates, who are also "Cloak and Dagger" addicts. Cloak and Dagger is a heavily disguised remake of 1949's The Window; both are based on the Cornell Woolrich story The Boy Cried Murder(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Weeks of lively auditions, gruelling boot camps and nerve-jangling live shows come to a head in the first instalment of the annual talent show's grand final. Before the winner is announced, 5 After Midnight, Matt Terry and Saara Aalto face yet another showdown, as judges Simon Cowell, Louis Walsh, Nicole Scherzinger and Sharon Osbourne deliver their verdict on each act's performance one final time. Taking to the stage alongside a surprise guest performer, the acts sing two songs each in front of an audience of thousands at Wembley Arena. The act with the lowest public-vote figures faces the gut-churning prospect of bowing out in third place, while the remaining two go on to battle it out in the second stage of the final.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Weeks of lively auditions, gruelling boot camps and nerve-jangling live shows come to a head in the first instalment of the annual talent show's grand final. Before the winner is announced, 5 After Midnight, Matt Terry and Saara Aalto face yet another showdown, as judges Simon Cowell, Louis Walsh, Nicole Scherzinger and Sharon Osbourne deliver their verdict on each act's performance one final time. Taking to the stage alongside a surprise guest performer, the acts sing two songs each in front of an audience of thousands at Wembley Arena.

Will himself didn't ask to be moved, and has a lot of trouble warming up to his pampered cousins Carlton (Alfonso Ribeiro), Hilary (Karyn Parsons) and Ashley (Tatyana M. Ali); meanwhile, his Uncle Philip (James Avery), a prominent attorney, is convinced that Will is a bad influence on his kids--especially after Ashley performs some impromptu rap lyrics in front of Phillip's astonished law partners. It is up to Will's Aunt Vivian (Janet Hubert-Whitten), Vy's sister, to act as mediator--and to convince both Will and Phillip that they've got a lot to learn about patience and tolerance(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Dark Girls</title>
    <desc lang="en">When Africans were first brought to the United States as slaves, many slave owners took a strange approach to diving the labor among the humans they owned -- lighter skinned blacks were assigned to work inside the house, performing more precise but less physically demanding chores, while their darker skinned brethren were forced to perform punishing manual labor in the fields. In the 21st Century, a grim vestige of this tradition lives on in African-American culture, as women with dark complexion often find themselves looked down upon by their peers, considered less attractive, less intelligent and less refined than women with a lighter skin tone. A variety of African-American women discuss this phenomenon, sharing their thoughts on the social and cultural implications of this subtle but common form of prejudice, in the documentary Dark Girls. Directors Bill Duke and D. Channsin Berry feature interviews with women sharing their own experiences as dark skinned African-Americans, children who reveal how young these beliefs are implanted in girls, and men who share their feelings about women and skin color. Dark Girls was an official selection at the 2011 Toronto Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Following memorable roles in the military action-adventures Pearl Harbor (2001) and Black Hawk Down (2001), young actor Josh Hartnett is propelled to romantic leading man status with this semi-autobiographical comedy from screenwriter Rob Perez. Hartnett stars as Matt Sullivan, a young man smarting over the bitter breakup of his most recent relationship. With Lent approaching, Matt decides to observe the 40-day tradition by abstaining from all sexual contact, including self-gratification. Once his odyssey of discipline has begun, he meets the girl of his dreams, while his ex begins campaigning to get him back. Co-starring Shannyn Sossamon, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Vinessa Shaw, 40 Days and 40 Nights inspired another round of controversy between distributor Miramax and the Catholic League, which accused the film of being a "vulgar parody" of Lent.

    <desc lang="en">This ensemble drama centers on a neighborhood cigar store as it chronicles the entangled lives of fifteen characters. The story is divided into five chapters each bearing the name of a different character. The main players have roles in all five stories. The first, "Paul" follows recently widowed novelist Paul Benjamin whose wife died during a bank robbery. He is almost hit by a truck when a black teenager who calls himself Rashid, saves him. The thankful novelist lets the teen stay with him for a while. Rashid's story forms the basis of chapter two. Paul is visited by Rashid's aunt who tells him that the boys true name is Thomas Cole. He has recently learned that his dad is really alive and living out of the city. Rashid journeys to meet his dad, Cyrus Cole. When he meets him, Rashid tells him his name is Paul Benjamin. Auggie, the cigar store manager, also gets a surprise when his ex-wife shows up to tell him his daughter is a pregnant drug addict. Rashid tells Paul that he has $6000, the spoils of a recent bank robbery perpetrated by his pal, Creeper. The rest of the chapters are equally convoluted(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Cavender Is Coming</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Cavender Is Coming. A reworking of the first-season Twilight Zone episode "Mr. Bevis," "Cavender Is Coming" was, like its predecessor, the pilot for a proposed comedy-fantasy TV series. Carol Burnett stars as klutzy Agnes Grep, whose combination of overeagerness and ineptitude costs her job after job. Enter Agnes' guardian angel Cavender (Jesse White), who, as big a screw-up as the heroine, has been assigned to Agnes to see if he is worthy of earning his wings. Transforming Agnes into a poised, sought-after fashion plate, Cavender discovers that she was happier when she was a "loser" -- meaning that Cavender will be stuck on Earth a long, long time, in search of someone whose life he can really turn around. Written with a heavy hand by Rod Serling, "Cavender Is Coming" benefits from the play between its two stars and from a rich and varied supporting cast including John Fiedler and Donna Douglas; in the final analysis, however, it is defeated by CBS' decision to add a raucous laughtrack, which is at its loudest when absolutely nothing funny is happening. "Cavender Is Coming" was originally telecast May 25, 1962(n)</desc>

Danny and Wheeler make their living promoting a high-energy drink to pupils as a wholesome alternative to drugs. The job fits perfectly with uber-slacker Wheeler's rock'n'roll lifestyle, while cynical Danny, whose focus is his girlfriend Beth, feels like his life is dribbling away. However, neither of them can find the motivation to grab life by the scruff - until, one day, they deliberately crash their truck and are given the choice between jail or community service. They choose the latter, becoming mentors to a 10-year-old breast-obsessed lad called Ronnie and teenage role-play gamer Augie. It's difficult to tell whose behaviour is worse, the children or the 'adults', but a battle of wills ensues, which will have a meaningful outcome for all four of them..(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In 1977, George Lucas released Star Wars, the ultimate sci-fi popcorn flick-turned-pop-culture myth machine. It quickly became the biggest money-making film of all time and changed the shape of the film industry. After two successful sequels (1980's The Empire Strikes Back and 1983's Return of the Jedi) that extended the story of the first film, Lucas took some time off to produce movies for others, with mixed success. In 1999, Lucas returned to the Star Wars saga with a new approach -- instead of picking up where Return of the Jedi left off, Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace would be the first of a trilogy of stories to trace what happened in the intergalactic saga before the first film began. Here, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) is a young apprentice Jedi knight under the tutelage of Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson); Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), who will later father Luke Skywalker and become known as Darth Vader, is just a nine-year-old boy. When the Trade Federation cuts off all routes to the planet Naboo, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan are assigned to settle the matter, but when they arrive on Naboo they are brought to Amidala (Natalie Portman), the Naboo queen, by a friendly but opportunistic Gungan named Jar Jar. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan plan to escort Amidala to a meeting of Republic leaders in Coruscant, but trouble with their spacecraft strands them on the planet Tatooine, where Qui-Gon meets Anakin, the slave of a scrap dealer. Qui-Gon is soon convinced that the boy could be the leader the Jedis have been searching for, and he begins bargaining for his freedom and teaching the boy the lessons of the Force. The supporting cast includes Pernilla August as Anakin's mother, Terence Stamp as Chancellor Valorum, and Samuel L. Jackson as Jedi master Mace Windu. Jackson told a reporter before The Phantom Menace's release that the best part about doing the film was that he got to say "May the Force be with you" onscreen(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones</title>
    <desc lang="en">The fifth film -- and the second prequel -- in director George Lucas' historic Star Wars series, Star Wars: Episode II -- Attack of the Clones begins ten years following the events in Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace. Senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman), former queen of the planet Naboo, arrives on the capital planet of Coruscant and narrowly escapes an assassination attempt that would have prevented her from calling a senatorial vote to grant Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) emergency head-of-state powers. This extreme action would have been in response to the alarming number of planets that have seceded from the Republic and formed a threatening opposition alliance. The Jedi Council places Amidala under the guard of Obi-wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and his young apprentice, Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen), which paves the way for Kenobi and Skywalker to learn more about the assassination plot on Amidala's life after a second attempt is made. After reporting their preliminary findings to the Jedi Council, Skywalker and Kenobi are split up by the council -- with young Anakin accompanying Amidala back to Naboo. Meanwhile, Obi-wan starts following the clues from the second assassination attempt and finds himself traveling to the mysterious planet of Camino. Back on Naboo, Anakin and Amidala's fondness for each other begins to blossom into love, which is strictly forbidden by Jedi code and causes a great deal of angst for the politician and the Jedi apprentice. Furthermore, Anakin's recurring nightmares about his mother, Shmi (Pernilla August), whom he hasn't seen in ten years, force the young Jedi to make the tough decision to return to Tatooine in order to search for her. This decision proves to be pivotal as Anakin discovers his fears to be warranted, which prompts the young and reckless Jedi apprentice to react in a manner very unbecoming of a Jedi. In the meantime, Obi-wan makes a shocking discovery on Camino, which leads him to the nearby planet Geonosis and forces him to send word of his findings back to the Jedi Council. Amidala and Anakin intercept the message, retransmit it to the Jedi Council, and set off for Geonosis to assist Kenobi. As the three are reunited and imprisoned by a former Jedi, the evil Count Dooku (Christopher Lee), the Jedi Council -- led by Jedi Masters Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz) and Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) -- is forced to intervene and thus puts into motion cataclysmic changes for the Republic and its adversaries(n)</desc>
