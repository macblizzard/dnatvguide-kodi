    <title lang="en">Scent of a Woman</title>
    <desc lang="en">Driven by an extravagant, tour-de-force performance by Al Pacino, Scent of a Woman is the story of Frank Slade (Pacino), a blind, retired army colonel who hires Charlie Simms (Chris O'Donnell), a poor college student on the verge of expulsion, to take care of him over Thanksgiving weekend. At the beginning of the weekend, Frank takes Charlie to New York, where he reveals to the student that he intends to visit his family, have a few terrific meals, sleep with a beautiful woman and, finally, commit suicide. The film follows the mis-matched pair over the course of the weekend, as they learn about life through their series of adventures. Though the story is a little contrived and predictable, it pulls all the right strings, thanks to O'Donnell's sympathetic supporting role and Pacino's powerful lead performance, for which he won his first Academy Award. Scent of a Woman is based on the 1975 Italian film Profumo Di Donna(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Destiny brings together a young lion and a young man in this drama from South African filmmaker Michael Swan. According to the legends of the Shangaan people of Africa, white lions are sacred creatures favored by the gods, and they're seen so rarely in the wild that when one is discovered, a Shangaan will be assigned to protect it. When a white lion cub is born near a Shangaan village, the other animals aren't sure what to make of the creature; the young lion named Letsatsi is rejected by its pride and must strike out on its own. Gisani (Thabo Malema), a Shangaan tribesman, learns that the white lion has left the wilds near his village and he follows Letsatsi to make sure the animal is safe and protect it from predators. An older lion named Nkulu makes friends with Letsatsi and shows the younger cat how to survive in the wild; meanwhile, Gisani takes a job as a hunting guide to support himself while staying in the wilds and keeping an eye on Letsatsi. However, when Nkulu is shot to death by a farmer and Letsatsi is targeted by one of Gisani's clients, the young warrior must take dramatic action to save the sacred lion. White Lion received its North American premiere at the 2010 Seattle International Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Francis Ford Coppola's legendary continuation and sequel to his landmark 1972 film, The Godfather, parallels the young Vito Corleone's rise with his son Michael's spiritual fall, deepening The Godfather's depiction of the dark side of the American dream. In the early 1900s, the child Vito flees his Sicilian village for America after the local Mafia kills his family. Vito (Robert De Niro) struggles to make a living, legally or illegally, for his wife and growing brood in Little Italy, killing the local Black Hand Fanucci (Gastone Moschin) after he demands his customary cut of the tyro's business. With Fanucci gone, Vito's communal stature grows, but it is his family (past and present) who matters most to him -- a familial legacy then upended by Michael's (Al Pacino) business expansion in the 1950s. Now based in Lake Tahoe, Michael conspires to make inroads in Las Vegas and Havana pleasure industries by any means necessary. As he realizes that allies like Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg) are trying to kill him, the increasingly paranoid Michael also discovers that his ambition has crippled his marriage to Kay (Diane Keaton) and turned his brother, Fredo (John Cazale), against him. Barely escaping a federal indictment, Michael turns his attention to dealing with his enemies, completing his own corruption(n)</desc>

The rest of the film follows tradition slavishly, and although the young cast is appealing and there are some nice individual moments, this film matches its predecessor neither in scares nor entertainment. Younger viewers -- who may not recognize every plot twist instantly -- should get a kick out of it anyway, but dedicated genre fans will be able to play connect-the-dots with the familiar storyline(n)</desc>

This edition focuses on the first hurdle any animal will face, surviving infancy. Cameras follow flightless barnacle goose chicks as they strive to find food, leaping 400ft down a cliff from the ledge where they hatched. Meanwhile, in New Zealand, young fur seals have stumbled across a safe haven in which they can learn how to avoid predators, while deep in the Gobi Desert, the long-eared jerboa learns to use its impeccable hearing to catch insect pray. Plus, albatross chicks make their first flight, as threatening tiger sharks wait patiently for them to slip up and land in the sea.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Suzy Klein's odyssey through the history of music in the 19th century concludes, turning the spotlight on later years, when technological revolutions seemed to make the world a smaller, more accessible place. Focusing on the Paris Exposition of 1889, a cultural showcase celebrating the centenary of the French Revoution, she reveals how composers such as Claude Debussy were exposed to the sounds of the East - immediately breaking Wagner's stranglehold of influence over Western music. She also examines the invention of saxophone, and makes her own recording on a vintage phonograph - an early precursor of vinyl records, cassette tapes and CDs. Last in the series.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Naturalist David Attenborough documents the universal tale that unites humanity with every other animal on the planet - the journey through life, and the goal to continue the bloodline through offspring. This edition focuses on the first hurdle any animal will face, surviving infancy. Cameras follow flightless barnacle goose chicks as they strive to find food, leaping 400ft down a cliff from the ledge where they hatched. Meanwhile, in New Zealand, young fur seals have stumbled across a safe haven in which they can learn how to avoid predators, while deep in the Gobi Desert, the long-eared jerboa learns to use its impeccable hearing to catch insect pray. Plus, albatross chicks make their first flight, as threatening tiger sharks wait patiently for them to slip up and land in the sea.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Home.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The importance of homes to animals, not only as a place to live but as a shelter from the elements and a refuge from enemies. A pack of African hunting dogs have made their home on a vast plain in Zambia, but it's far from safe as they must battle hyenas and protect their young. Hermit crabs on a tropical island settle down in empty snail shells - and when a new property washes ashore, they all form a queue, then move up the housing chain until all the shells are taken. On the edge of the Sahara are chimpanzees, whose survival relies on knowing where to find water in the most extreme droughts. Here the elders lead a troop on a brutal trek to a dried-out riverbed to dig wells.(n)</desc>

An orphaned young chimp tries to climb the social ladder, but his troop is ruled by big, aggressive males and his first attempt to join them ends in a beating. A meerkat society will only allow newcomers in if they know how to deal with a venomous snake. And the only way to occupy the top spot in a meadow of kangaroos is to beat the ruling male in a boxing match - but few have challenged the current incumbent, who stands at 8ft. Will any animal dare take him on? David Attenborough narrates.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Courtship.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">David Attenborough reveals how the competition to breed creates scenes of the most extraordinary beauty, as well as some of the most violent battles seen in nature. A male flame bowerbird shows off its artistic prowess to impress a potential mate - but if that does not prove enough, it will demonstrate its dancing skills instead. Waved albatrosses pair up for life and spend hours in each other's company, although things are not so simple for a male peacock jumping spider - one wrong move in its dazzling courtship routine could prove fatal. However, one of the most magnificent displays of all is created by a tiny male pufferfish, which impresses the ladies by building a spectacular underwater `crop circle' in the sand - arguably the most perfect and complex structure created by any animal.(n)</desc>

A turtle hauls itself up the beach to lay its eggs in a safe place, only for the tide to trap it behind a wall of coral. A mother bonobo in the Congo teaches its son the skills it will need to survive adulthood, bison protect their calves from the ever-present threat of wolves and a mother zebra has to lead its foal across a dangerous river.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The importance of homes to animals, not only as a place to live but as a shelter from the elements and a refuge from enemies. A pack of African hunting dogs have made their home on a vast plain in Zambia, but it's far from safe as they must battle hyenas and protect their young. Hermit crabs on a tropical island settle down in empty snail shells - and when a new property washes ashore, they all form a queue, then move up the housing chain until all the shells are taken. On the edge of the Sahara are chimpanzees, whose survival relies on knowing where to find water in the most extreme droughts. Here the elders lead a troop on a brutal trek to a dried-out riverbed to dig wells.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Naturalist David Attenborough documents the universal tale that unites humanity with every other animal on the planet - the journey through life, and the goal to continue the bloodline through offspring. This edition focuses on the first hurdle any animal will face, surviving infancy. Cameras follow flightless barnacle goose chicks as they strive to find food, leaping 400ft down a cliff from the ledge where they hatched. Meanwhile, in New Zealand, young fur seals have stumbled across a safe haven in which they can learn how to avoid predators, while deep in the Gobi Desert, the long-eared jerboa learns to use its impeccable hearing to catch insect pray. Plus, albatross chicks make their first flight, as threatening tiger sharks wait patiently for them to slip up and land in the sea.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Fifth Element</title>
    <desc lang="en">The mysterious fifth element when combined with four others creates the ultimate weapon against universal evil. The story begins in 1914 when benign aliens visit an ancient Egyptian temple to steal four stones containing information about this mysterious element. The visitors promise to return to Earth in the future to save it from evil. Three centuries pass and Earth is threatened by a thunderous Cosmic Evil. Unfortunately, the Evil killed the Good aliens who promised to save the planet. Fortunately, Earthlings have a piece of one of the alien saviors. Utilizing DNA restructuring, scientists grow the piece into a perfect new alien which takes the form of a curvaceous, seductive no-holds barred redheaded acrobat who escapes from the lab with the police in hot pursuit. Desperately she dives into a cab reluctantly driven by luckless former special force officer (Bruce Willis) who suddenly finds himself faced with the task of saving the universe by finding the missing stones and vanquishing the evil forces. Featuring dazzling special effects and classy production values coupled with a healthy splash of outlandish high fashion the emphasis of Besson's film is not so much plot as it is over-the top spectacle(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Schindler's List</title>
    <desc lang="en">Steven Spielberg's masterwork deals with the Holocaust, but the Holocaust on a personal level -- how one man's morality and humanity changes in the face of unmitigated horror. As the film's tagline aptly sums it up: "Whoever saves one life, saves the entire world." The film begins in Krakow, Poland in 1939. Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), an imposing, well-dressed bon-vivant is seen buying drinks and caviar for Nazi officers, who permit him to open up a clay-pot factory, enlisting cheap labor provided by Jewish refugees. Schindler asks Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), a Jewish accountant, to help him obtain backing for the factory. By 1941, the Jewish community has been herded into the Ghetto, and the elders agree to back Schindler, reasoning that having a job might guarantee the Jews a reprieve from death in the concentration camps. But, by 1943, the Ghetto is being liquidated, and the remaining residents are brought to the Plaszow Forced Labor Camp. The commandant, Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) is a cold-blooded Nazi sadist, who at the same time is attracted to Jewish inmate Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz), whom he makes his maid. When the time came for his unpaid Jewish workers to be sent to their deaths, Schindler was able to rescue over a thousand of them by placing them on his special list of "essential" workers and by befriending Goeth and using his friendship to campaign for their reprieve(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Jack Black stars in this take on Jonathan Swift's 1726 novel, though director Rob Letterman's family-friendly version tones down the satire and concentrates just on Gulliver's early adventures. Lemuel Gulliver works in the post room of a New York newspaper. Spying an opportunity to impress the beautiful editor Darcy Silverman, he stoops to plagiarising travel websites in order to win a commission to write his own travel piece. He succeeds, but his reward is an assignment to the Bermuda Triangle, where he inevitably vanishes without trace. Gulliver wakes up on the shores of an island that's home to a nation of tiny people who appear to be stuck in the 18th century. And they aren't at all sure what to do with this gargantuan beast that Providence has washed up among them. The Lilliputian cast include Billy Connolly, Catherine Tate, Chris O'Dowd, Emily Blunt and James Corden(n)</desc>

Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) is concerned, but can't seem to figure out what the matter is, and urges her daughter to ignore her feelings and put on a happy face. Lisa, however, makes friends with local jazz musician Bleeding Gums Murphy (voice of Ron Taylor), who shows her how to work out her bad feelings by playing the blues. Marge, however, isn't so sure that playing blues riffs will really help Lisa in the long run. Meanwhile, Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) has problems with Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright), who has been subjecting Homer to a series of "defeats -- correction, humiliating defeats" on their video boxing game; Homer is convinced he has to start winning if he wants to regain the respect of his son. "Moaning Lisa" first aired on February 11, 1990(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Rosebud. Elderly nuclear power magnate C. Montgomery Burns (voice of Harry Shearer) is celebrating his birthday, but while his loyal assistant, Waylon Smithers (also voiced by Shearer), stages a very special party, complete with international dignitaries and an appearance by the Ramones, Burns is still unhappy. Lately, Burns has been pining for the teddy bear he had as a child, Bobo, and he won't be happy until he can recover the toy. Smithers is put on the project, but the bear soon turns up in a very unlikely place -- in a bag of ice purchased by Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castallaneta). Homer gives the teddy bear to his baby daughter, Maggie, and when Homer learns that there's a very valuable old teddy bear in his home, he discovers that Maggie doesn't want to give up her new teddy. Burns offers Homer a large sum of money for the bear, but Homer is forced to turn it down when Maggie refuses to give up the bear; angry, Burns then tries to force Homer to give up the bear by cutting off his supplies of beer and television, and eventually Burns and Smithers plan an elaborate plot to steal the bear. "Rosebud" first aired on April 18, 1993(n)</desc>

For his starter, he learns about the `surprise' pies of the 17th century and a dwarf boy who would jump out of one at a grand feast. Heston prepares a gala pie made up of beetroot and horseradish ice-cream in place of meat, with goat's cheese panna cotta, saffron and bacon, and the main course is a gothic affair inspired by Sweeney Todd. The chef also sets out to make the lightest ever mash with an attempt to change the molecular structure of a potato. The dinner is served to a select group of pie-makers 100ft in the air over the East End of London.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Pies.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Heston Blumenthal delves into the history of iconic British dishes to find inspiration for a culinary salute, beginning with a three-course pie banquet. For his starter, he learns about the `surprise' pies of the 17th century and a dwarf boy who would jump out of one at a grand feast. Heston prepares a gala pie made up of beetroot and horseradish ice-cream in place of meat, with goat's cheese panna cotta, saffron and bacon, and the main course is a gothic affair inspired by Sweeney Todd. The chef also sets out to make the lightest ever mash with an attempt to change the molecular structure of a potato. The dinner is served to a select group of pie-makers 100ft in the air over the East End of London.(n)</desc>

Thirteen years before, Jack accepted a brokerage internship that marred his relationship with Kate, under the promise that they would only be separated one year. But much later, Jack has become an urban Wall Street exec with no wife or family of his own, and a mysterious proxy (Don Cheadle) offers him the opportunity to step into the life he left behind. After falling asleep in his posh New York apartment, Jack awakens to find himself in bed with his now-wife Kate, daughter Annie (Makenzie Vega), and a new baby, none of which he has ever experienced in his fast-paced single life. After discovering his "real" life has been eliminated, he begrudgingly tries to fit in with his newly appointed life as a family man. The Family Man also stars Saul Rubinek and Jeremy Piven(n)</desc>

Thirteen years before, Jack accepted a brokerage internship that marred his relationship with Kate, under the promise that they would only be separated one year. But much later, Jack has become an urban Wall Street exec with no wife or family of his own, and a mysterious proxy (Don Cheadle) offers him the opportunity to step into the life he left behind. After falling asleep in his posh New York apartment, Jack awakens to find himself in bed with his now-wife Kate, daughter Annie (Makenzie Vega), and a new baby, none of which he has ever experienced in his fast-paced single life. After discovering his "real" life has been eliminated, he begrudgingly tries to fit in with his newly appointed life as a family man. The Family Man also stars Saul Rubinek and Jeremy Piven(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In Kirk DeMicco's animated film three supersonic simian spacemen take to the cosmos to find a missing probe, and encounter a whole world of trouble along the way. Ham III, the grandson of the first ever chimp in space, is a wise-cracking smart aleck who makes a living being fired from a cannon. When the Infinity Space Probe goes missing, Ham joins a mission to find it. He's been recruited as a PR stunt, but his fellow Space Chimps, Luna and Titan, are highly trained experts. When they crash-land on the planet Malgor, they find a race of aliens who are being oppressed by the tyrannical Zartog, who is using the probe for his own nefarious ends. Can the feckless Ham use his circus skills to save the day, help liberate the aliens, recover the probe, get the girl, and find a way to get back home? This is great fare for all the family, with plenty of deadpan asides to keep grown-ups entertained(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In September 2004, comedian Dave Chappelle took a break from his immensely successful Comedy Central show to stage a free, unpublicized, all-star hip-hop concert in the Clinton Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn, NY. Inviting fans over the Internet, on the street, and even in his family's hometown of Yellow Springs, OH, Chappelle asked filmmaker Michel Gondry to document the event from its inception on through to the performances themselves. The result is Dave Chappelle's Block Party, a concert film that provides not only a sampling of the music on display that September, but also an intimate look at the comedian himself. Gondry's cameras tag along with Chappelle as he visits Ohio, recruits a university marching band to play at the show, and surveys the opinions of Clinton Hill on the show that's about to take place. Along the way, we're introduced to some the comedian's favorite acts, in rehearsals and on-stage: Dead Prez, Jill Scott, Mos Def, the Roots, Erykah Badu, Kanye West, and the surprise reuniting of the Fugees(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Fence</title>
    <desc lang="en">In October 2006, the United States government authorized the construction of a massive fence stretching seven hundred miles along the border separating the U.S. and Mexico. Proponents of the fence claimed that it would help prevent illegal immigration into the United States and foil drug smuggling. However, three years into the construction project, undocumented aliens are still streaming into America through communities divided by the fence, and drug traffic has not been significantly reduced. The fence also runs through a number of Mexican communities, dividing small towns and school campuses thanks to poor planning, and the construction has had a negative effect on the environment of previously unspoiled territories. The fence is ugly, impractical and ineffective -- so why is America still spending billions on dollars on completing a project that's a failure? Filmmaker Rory Kennedy examines the strange history and sometimes comical consequences of the border project in the documentary The Fence; produced for the premium cable network HBO, The Fence received its world premiere at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Matchstick Men</title>
    <desc lang="en">Ridley Scott directs the crime comedy Matchstick Men, based on the novel of the same name by Eric Garcia. Neurotic con man Roy (Nicolas Cage) suffers from several emotional problems, including obsessive-compulsive disorder. He and his partner Frank (Sam Rockwell) swindle people out of money by posing as money collectors who promise things like tax refunds, package vacations, and other fabulous prizes (which they never get). Frank wants to pull a really big job, but Roy is too consumed with fear and panic attacks to join him. Only cigarettes and his trusty illegal prescription drugs seem to keep him going. When Roy finds himself in desperate need of more pills, he is forced to see legitimate psychotherapist Dr. Klein (Bruce Altman). Roy ends up talking about his emotional damage from a troubled marriage and divorce, which results in the discovery of a child whom he has never met. Dr. Klein suggests that he spend a weekend with the kid, so in walks teenaged Angela (played by twentysomething Alison Lohman). Reluctant to develop his role as a father, Roy also gets heavily involved in Frank's ambitious swindle(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Voice UK</title>
    <desc lang="en">The sought-after contract with Polydor Records becomes ever more tangible a goal as the eight remaining would-be pop icons enter the semi-final. Having survived auditions, the battle rounds, the knockout stage and the quarter-finals, the contestants should be more than a little familiar with the pressures of a live performance. However, with a place in the grand final in the offing, the pressure has never been higher for the singers. As always, coaches Will.i.am, Tom Jones, Gavin Rossdale and Jennifer Hudson are on hand to deliver their verdicts on each performer's voice-work, and ultimately cut the number of hopeful stars by half, as only four competitors can progress through to the final. Emma Willis provides viewers with access to all the backstage drama and on-stage reactions as events unfold.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">England v Lithuania (Kick-off 5.00pm). Mark Pougatch presents coverage of the Group F clash between the countries at Wembley Stadium. Gareth Southgate's side currently top the qualifying table, but the manager will know his men need to maintain their good form if they are to remain in top spot, with Slovenia - who play Scotland later today - breathing down their necks in second place. The Lithuanians comes into this contest having suffered a 4-0 loss away to Slovakia in their most recent qualifier, but have also claimed a 1-1 draw away to Scotland earlier in the campaign, and could make things difficult for England if they attempt to stymie their attacking play. With commentary by Clive Tyldesley and Glenn Hoddle, and analysis by Ryan Giggs, Lee Dixon and Ian Wright.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Voice UK</title>
    <desc lang="en">The sought-after contract with Polydor Records becomes ever more tangible a goal as the eight remaining would-be pop icons enter the semi-final. Having survived auditions, the battle rounds, the knockout stage and the quarter-finals, the contestants should be more than a little familiar with the pressures of a live performance. However, with a place in the grand final in the offing, the pressure has never been higher for the singers. As always, coaches Will.i.am, Tom Jones, Gavin Rossdale and Jennifer Hudson are on hand to deliver their verdicts on each performer's voice-work, and ultimately cut the number of hopeful stars by half, as only four competitors can progress through to the final. Emma Willis provides viewers with access to all the backstage drama and on-stage reactions as events unfold.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Kevin McCloud follows Matt and Sophie White from Sussex as they build a giant family house of fun for themselves and their children. Going against the norm of designing a serious and practical home, the couple's property features a revolving bookcase door, secret dens, hiding places, one-way mirrors, and a fireman's pole. Matt uses a steel frame system to allow them to change the layout of the property, and other changes include amending the window shapes and sizes, and adding a half floor to create a James Bond room.(n)</desc>

Despite the overwhelming evidence against Mr. Krabs -- not to mention having been turned down for a long-awaited promotion at the restaurant -- SpongeBob (voice of Tom Kenny) refuses to believe that his boss is responsible and teams up with his best friend, Patrick (voice of Bill Fagerbakke), on a mission to Shell City, where he hopes he can exonerate Mr. Krabs and return the crown to its rightful owner. Of course, this is no easy task; once outside the safety of Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob is faced with the overwhelming dangers of the sea, not the least of which being a cyclops that many believe to be responsible for the deaths of countless other unfortunate sea-creatures who ventured outside county lines. Among those who lent their vocal chords to the film include Scarlett Johansson, Jeffrey Tambor, and Alec Baldwin(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Roger Donaldson's bank heist/ conspiracy thriller hybrid - scripted by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais - stars Jason Statham as the leader of a gang of thieves who bite off more than they can chew. When car dealer and one-time crook Terry Leather is approached by his old flame Martine Love with a proposition that would put his money worries behind him for good, he jumps at the chance. Leather quickly assembles a team which digs a tunnel directly into a London bank's vault. But what he hasn't been told is that, in addition to the money, he'll also be stealing a safety box containing material that would be extremely damaging to the royal family if it saw the light of day. Another box they take holds further dramatic revelations concerning establishment figures. So it's not long before Leather and the gang are pursued by the police, MI5 and various thugs, all keen to get their hands on the incendiary information... Edited for sexual scenes(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In this thriller, Ashley Judd plays Elizabeth Parsons, who is convicted of murdering her husband and sentenced to a long stretch in prison. After Elizabeth has spent six years behind bars, it turns out that her husband is still alive: he faked his own death as part of an insurance scam, and Elizabeth is soon released. However, Elizabeth's feelings for her husband can hardly be described as warm, and she wants custody of her son. Elizabeth's parole officer (Tommy Lee Jones) wonders if she might try to make his murder a real thing after all, especially since the law states a person cannot be convicted of the same crime twice. Double Jeopardy was directed by Bruce Beresford, from a screenplay by Douglas S. Cook and David Weisberg(n)</desc>

After a botched job, they're sent by their boss Harry Waters to hide out in Bruges. Ken loves the city and its history; Ray hates it, until he hooks up with beautiful drugs dealer Chloe and a mouthy dwarf actor, Jimmy. Unfortunately, just as life seems to be improving for the two hitmen, psychopathic Harry phones to deliver stark instructions: the nature of the botched hit has offended his sense of morality and he's decided to break up the partnership, ordering one of the duo to kill the other. This tests the bond linking the three men, and leads to a violent denouement in the ancient city's cobbled streets(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In this thriller, Ashley Judd plays Elizabeth Parsons, who is convicted of murdering her husband and sentenced to a long stretch in prison. After Elizabeth has spent six years behind bars, it turns out that her husband is still alive: he faked his own death as part of an insurance scam, and Elizabeth is soon released. However, Elizabeth's feelings for her husband can hardly be described as warm, and she wants custody of her son. Elizabeth's parole officer (Tommy Lee Jones) wonders if she might try to make his murder a real thing after all, especially since the law states a person cannot be convicted of the same crime twice. Double Jeopardy was directed by Bruce Beresford, from a screenplay by Douglas S. Cook and David Weisberg(n)</desc>

It's the mid-1970s and Southern Californian teen Joan Larkin has changed her name to Joan Jett. Along with her new dark, edgy identity comes a nascent desire: to create an all-girl rock band. Joan and her aggressive manager Kim Fowley stumble across the perfect face for the band: the 15-year-old blonde bombshell Cherie Curie. The two girls become close, with Cherie's sweet melodies slickly harmonising with Joan's electrifying guitar solos to great effect. They name themselves The Runaways and, after recruiting a lead guitarist and a bass player, are soon signed to Mercury Records, plunging them into the deep end of 70s rock excess. The success of their first album is massive. But, after a concert in Japan, the rest of the band discover magazines that feature only pictures of Cherie inside them - and are furious that they've been left out. Cherie begins to crumble under the pressures of being the face of the band, and starts to find solace in alcohol and drugs. As the band's stability disintegrates, can the girls rediscover the fun, runaway rock and roll lifestyle they sought?(n)</desc>

Along with a dizzying series of stylized shoot-outs, Ghost Dog also features carrier pigeons, characters who read Rashomon, a French-speaking ice cream man, and a score by RZA from the top-selling hip-hop group Wu-Tang Clan, who have their own well-documented obsession with Asian culture. Ghost Dog was screened in competition at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Labyrinth of Lies</title>
    <desc lang="en">In this historical drama, idealistic German public prosecutor Johann Radmann (Alexander Fehling) becomes interested in the case of Charles Schulz, a former Nazi officer at Auschwitz who is now a schoolteacher. Radmann initially encounters resistance from the rest of his department when he begins his investigation, but senior prosecutor Walter Friedberg (Robert Hunger-Buhler) ultimately allows him to build as many cases as possible against the 8000 people who worked at the death camp. Helmed by first-time feature-film director Giulio Ricciarelli, Labyrinth of Lies is based on the Frankfurt Auschwitz trials, a previously lesser-known chapter of Germany's post-WWII history in which the country was forced to reckon with the Nazis who returned to everyday life following the end of the war. Germany's official Foreign Language submission for the 2016 Academy Awards. Friederike Becht, Andre Szymanski, and Hansi Jochmann co-star(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Grindhouse</title>
    <desc lang="en">Kill Bill director Quentin Tarantino and Sin City director Robert Rodriguez join forces to offer a cinematic tribute to the blood-soaked exploitation epics of yesteryear with this hyper-violent coupling of two full-length features punctuated by a collection of outrageous trailers. The first segment, directed by Rodriguez and entitled Planet Terror, details the violent struggle between a ravenous army of zombie-like humanoids who have taken control of the planet and the remaining survivors who refuse to go down without a fight. Freddy Rodriguez, Naveen Andrews, and Rose McGowan headline a cast that also includes Marley Shelton, Michael Biehn, Josh Brolin, Bruce Willis, and Tom Savini. In Death Proof -- director Tarantino's take on such peddle-to-the-metal shockers as White Line Fever -- Kurt Russell stars as an engine-revving psychopath who prefers to take out his beautiful victims at 200 mph. With a list of potential roadkill candidates that includes Rose McGowan, Jordan Ladd, Rosario Dawson, and Vanessa Ferlito, Death Proof takes viewers on an adrenaline-infused drive that's as sexy as it is shocking. Its tantalizing title borrowed from the term frequently used to describe the seedy, 1970s-era inner-city movie theaters that screened excessive, low-budget independent films containing copious amounts of violence and nudity as a means of offering counter-programming to the decidedly more restrained big-budget studio films, Grindhouse takes its love for these unabashedly sleazy efforts one step further by offering a jaw-dropping collection of fake exploitation trailers from such directors as Rob Zombie, Eli Roth, and Edgar Wright(n)</desc>

He becomes caught up in a war between the gang and the residents of Pig Sty Alley, which the gang want to take over. Little do they know that two of the Alley's residents are retired martial arts experts and soon the fists and feet are flying in knockabout fights that owe as much to Kill Bill (some of the wire work is done by Yuen Wo Ping, who worked on Tarantino's film) as they do to classic Hollywood silent comedies. Film fans can enjoy Chow's references to films ranging from Top Hat to The Shining while the rest can just enjoy a wildly entertaining romp. In Cantonese with English subtitles(n)</desc>

The Creeper has just two days of his allotted 23 on earth left to both eat his fill and replenish body parts that have decayed during his enforced years of hibernation. Fortunately, a broken-down bus full of college basketball players and their cheerleaders should provide for his needs. As the students are picked off one by one, their only hope is local farmer Jack Taggart, who's out to avenge his son's death. Victor Salva's film is satisfyingly full of edge-of-the-seat moments, not to mention the required quota of gruesome deaths and gore(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Independence Day</title>
    <desc lang="en">Roland Emmerich's blockbuster of a science fiction film sees aliens reach Earth. And they're decidedly hostile - their plan is to suck the planet of all its resources and leave behind a burnt cinder circling the sun before moving on. Planting giant ships above the world's major cities, they unleash destruction on an unprecedented scale (superbly caught by the special effects). All attempts at fighting back are met by hordes of fighter craft until pilot Steven Hiller manages to down one and capture the pilot. In tandem, scientist David Levinson, having worked out their purpose, also works out a way to destroy them but he and Hiller need a space craft. Which brings them to a secret base near Las Vegas. The child of countless science fiction movies, Independence Day is rollicking, fast-moving fun and if the fate of the remains of the human race is never in doubt, there's enough tension and action to carry even the most jaundiced viewer along(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">(2003) When the world is struck by extraordinary phenomena, it becomes apparent that the planet's core has stopped moving, causing electro-magnetic mayhem. The only hope lies in a crack team of scientists (led by Aaron Eckhart and including Stanley Tucci, Hilary Swank and Delroy Lindo) burrowing to the core and re-starting Earth's engine. But is the disaster natural or is there a more sinister explanation? Jon Amiel's taut science-fiction special-effects extravaganza eschews outer space for inner space. Edited for language(n)</desc>
