    <desc lang="en">When a bumbling movie lover becomes magnetized while attempting to sabotage a local power plant and accidentally erases all of the videotapes in the small video store where his best friend works, the pair attempt to keep the store's loyal customer base by remaking as many of the top-renting movies as possible. Mike (Mos Def) is an employee at Be Kind Rewind, a modest mom and pop video store that is owned by Mr. Fletcher (Danny Glover). Mike's best friend Jerry (Jack Black) works in an auto garage/junkyard directly adjacent to a local power plant. Lately Jerry has become increasingly paranoid about the effects that the power plant is having on his health. Convinced that he has developed a brain tumor from working in such close proximity to the power plant, Jerry attempts to sabotage the plant. Unfortunately for Jerry, his brain is magnetized in the process. The next time Jerry goes to visit Mike at Be Kind Rewind, the powerful magnetization emanating from his brain erases every videotape in the store. Now the only way for Mike and Jerry to be sure that Be Kind Rewind stays in business is to remake every film on the shelves before the customers notice. But when word gets out that Mike and Jerry have remade such Hollywood classics as Back to the Future, Robocop, The Lion King, and Rush Hour without permission, the store is threatened with copyright violations and forced to close its doors. In the aftermath of the closing, Mr. Fletcher and his employees discover just how loyal their customers really are when the entire neighborhood pools their resources to transform the junkyard into a legitimate movie studio and produce an entirely original film detailing the incredible adventures of a local jazz legend(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">One of the first projects of syndicated TV producer Steve Rotfield, the weekly half-hour Wild About Animals was hosted by actress Mariette Hartley. The series cast its spotlight on rare animals, unique to specific regions of the United States. Regular weekly features included "K9 Cops and Animal Heroes," "Celebrity Owners," and "Animal Bloopers." First telecast in the fall of 1995, Wild About Animals was still flourishing at the end of the 20th century, by which time it was being shown in tandem with two other Rotfield efforts, The Lighter Side of Sports and Awesome Adventures, in most local markets(n)</desc>

As the wounded continue to pour in at an alarming rate, Hawkeye (Alan Alda), Trapper (Wayne Rogers), and the rest of the staff struggle to maintain their sanity -- and, hopefully, their sense of humor. They are aided and abetted by visiting psychiatrist Sidney Freedman (Allan Arbus), whose laid-back ministrations come in handy when Hawkeye abruptly loses a young patient after heart-massaging the boy back to life. This episode was based on the actual experiences of the 8055th, the Korean-War MASH unit that served as inspiration for the 4077th, and which once treated over 5,000 casualties during a two-month period. "O.R." was originally broadcast on October 8, 1974(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The extraordinary story of a strange cult that came to light in 2013, when three women emerged from a small flat in Brixton, south London, after decades in captivity. The documentary traces the group back to its roots in the 1970s, when Aravindan Balakrishnan, who believed in an international communist revolution, created a tiny political sect that followed the teachings of China's Chairman Mao. However, his left-wing collective evolved into a pseudo-religious cult, in which members were controlled, threatened and brainwashed so that they were too terrified to leave.(n)</desc>

Here, actor Paul Kaye steps into the celebrated writer's shoes, charting Terry's life from his troubled schooldays and his difficulties securing the respect of literary critics, through to his eventual success, and his gradual decline into ill health. The film makes use of Terry's own words, along with those of his friend and collaborator Neil Gaiman, contemporary Val McDermid, and long-serving assistant Rob Wilkins.(n)</desc>

When a TV morning show's ratings fail to impress the suits, its producer Abby Richter finds herself having to welcome a new, and hopefully ratings-boosting, host, Mike Chadaway. Trouble is, she's a control-freak perfectionist, while he's the chauvinistic former host of a freewheeling late-night chat show, who's used to living in the moment. The two are destined from the start not to get along. And so it proves. But when Abby falls for an attractive doctor, she takes the questionable decision to follow Mike's dating advice.

    <title lang="en">The Ugly Truth</title>
    <desc lang="en">Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler star in this sexually unsophisticated romcom from writer/ director Robert Luketic. When a TV morning show's ratings fail to impress the suits, its producer Abby Richter finds herself having to welcome a new, and hopefully ratings-boosting, host, Mike Chadaway. Trouble is, she's a control-freak perfectionist, while he's the chauvinistic former host of a freewheeling late-night chat show, who's used to living in the moment. The two are destined from the start not to get along. And so it proves. But when Abby falls for an attractive doctor, she takes the questionable decision to follow Mike's dating advice. Cue a succession of crude and, for Abby, humiliating set-pieces as she aims to snag her man..(n)</desc>

He has been fighting his council in the Isle of Wight for a much bigger house and is also at loggerheads with the benefits office for capping his weekly payment. West Midlands mother-of-eight Marie Buchanan has recently split from her partner and is looking for a larger home, while Ipswich couple the Fisks have been in dispute with their neighbours, who objected to two houses being knocked into one to accommodate them and their 13 children.(n)</desc>

In the opening edition, she and her fellow passengers stop off in Nassau in the Bahamas, where Jane finds solace in the state's oldest baptist church, and St Martin, where she seeks an intimate underwater audience with a host of sharks. Back on board, Jane is startled by the scale of everything - from the food and activities to the sheer number of people.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">On a cold November morning in 1983, armed robbers targeted the Brinks Mat security depot at the Heathrow International Trading Estate. Following an extremely brutal military-style raid, the gang got away with over £26million of gold. The robbery - the country's biggest and most notorious - caused the price of gold to soar and sent ripples through the criminal underworld. This programme hears from police officers who followed the increasingly complex case, as it pieces together the legacy of the heist.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">World's Biggest Diamond Heist.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Documentary telling the story of how, in February 2003, a criminal mastermind managed to break into highly secure vaults of the Diamond Centre in Antwerp, Belgium, stealing around £91million in what came to be considered the biggest diamond heist in history. The robbery was planned over the span of more than two years, by a master thief who outlined his scheme in meticulous detail, but was eventually brought to justice by the smallest of mistakes. Making use of the testimonies of victims, investigators and even the culprit's lawyer, this film details how the master thief managed to overcome the vault's sophisticated combination lock, along with high-tech motion, heat and light sensors, to escape with his valuable prize.(n)</desc>

As summer encroaches, 16-year-old Manhattanite Finn Earl (Anton Yelchin) would love nothing more than to trek off to South America and spend the year's sun-drenched months near the equator, embarking on thrilling adventures with his estranged archaeologist father, whom he's never met. Alas, the bonds of family rein in tight when Finn's booze- and coke-addled mother, the masseuse Liz (Diane Lane), cries out for help -- and, in the process, unwittingly gets Finn arrested. In a dramatic attempt to reverse circumstances and sort out the complications in both of their lives, Liz insists on taking custody of Finn for the summer. Both, she insists, will live in the home of one of her former massage clients, the aging billionaire Ogden C. Osborne (Donald Sutherland) -- with whom she may be amorously involved. Though Finn agrees begrudgingly at first, in time he finds the environment welcoming -- as he develops a crush on Ogden's gorgeous granddaughter (Kristen Stewart) and befriends Ogden's grandson. But when an unforeseen and shocking act of violence erupts, it estranges Finn and Liz from their posh surroundings and provides a sobering, harrowing reminder of the socioeconomic differences between the Earls and their new friends(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Snow Angels</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director/screenwriter David Gordon Green adapts Stewart O'Nan's popular novel to the screen in this feature, which tells the parallel tales of a teenager named Arthur (Michael Angarano) and his onetime babysitter Annie (Kate Beckinsale) -- whose turbulent relationship with her estranged husband, Glenn (Sam Rockwell), leads the small-town waitress down a troubled path. Arthur is a high-school student from a dysfunctional family, and does everything in his power to avoid hanging around the house while mom and dad quarrel. When he's not practicing his trombone and performing with the high-school marching band, Arthur can usually be found bussing tables at the local Chinese restaurant and flirting with older waitress Annie. Annie used to be Arthur's babysitter, and is currently struggling to separate from her former high-school sweetheart, Glenn. But being a single mother isn't easy, especially since the troubled Glenn wants nothing more than to clean up his act and reunite his family. Back at school, Arthur and pretty classmate Lila (Olivia Thirlby) have been bonding over their mutual love for all things geeky. Though the casual friendship shows promise of evolving into something more when Lila expresses her true feelings for Arthur, he can't help but becoming distracted by his chaotic family life: his father is moving out of the family home, and his mother is doing everything in her power to maintain some semblance of normalcy. Realizing that happiness is fleeting as his family becomes shattered and Annie experiences a series of distressing encounters with Glenn, Arthur gradually begins to fall for Lisa despite his growing cynicism concerning long-term relationships. Later, on a cold winter morning, Glenn and Annie's past catches up with them in a blinding flash, and the lives of everyone they know are suddenly and irrevocably changed(n)</desc>

As summer encroaches, 16-year-old Manhattanite Finn Earl (Anton Yelchin) would love nothing more than to trek off to South America and spend the year's sun-drenched months near the equator, embarking on thrilling adventures with his estranged archaeologist father, whom he's never met. Alas, the bonds of family rein in tight when Finn's booze- and coke-addled mother, the masseuse Liz (Diane Lane), cries out for help -- and, in the process, unwittingly gets Finn arrested. In a dramatic attempt to reverse circumstances and sort out the complications in both of their lives, Liz insists on taking custody of Finn for the summer. Both, she insists, will live in the home of one of her former massage clients, the aging billionaire Ogden C. Osborne (Donald Sutherland) -- with whom she may be amorously involved. Though Finn agrees begrudgingly at first, in time he finds the environment welcoming -- as he develops a crush on Ogden's gorgeous granddaughter (Kristen Stewart) and befriends Ogden's grandson. But when an unforeseen and shocking act of violence erupts, it estranges Finn and Liz from their posh surroundings and provides a sobering, harrowing reminder of the socioeconomic differences between the Earls and their new friends(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Snow Angels</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director/screenwriter David Gordon Green adapts Stewart O'Nan's popular novel to the screen in this feature, which tells the parallel tales of a teenager named Arthur (Michael Angarano) and his onetime babysitter Annie (Kate Beckinsale) -- whose turbulent relationship with her estranged husband, Glenn (Sam Rockwell), leads the small-town waitress down a troubled path. Arthur is a high-school student from a dysfunctional family, and does everything in his power to avoid hanging around the house while mom and dad quarrel. When he's not practicing his trombone and performing with the high-school marching band, Arthur can usually be found bussing tables at the local Chinese restaurant and flirting with older waitress Annie. Annie used to be Arthur's babysitter, and is currently struggling to separate from her former high-school sweetheart, Glenn. But being a single mother isn't easy, especially since the troubled Glenn wants nothing more than to clean up his act and reunite his family. Back at school, Arthur and pretty classmate Lila (Olivia Thirlby) have been bonding over their mutual love for all things geeky. Though the casual friendship shows promise of evolving into something more when Lila expresses her true feelings for Arthur, he can't help but becoming distracted by his chaotic family life: his father is moving out of the family home, and his mother is doing everything in her power to maintain some semblance of normalcy. Realizing that happiness is fleeting as his family becomes shattered and Annie experiences a series of distressing encounters with Glenn, Arthur gradually begins to fall for Lisa despite his growing cynicism concerning long-term relationships. Later, on a cold winter morning, Glenn and Annie's past catches up with them in a blinding flash, and the lives of everyone they know are suddenly and irrevocably changed(n)</desc>

She also meets a tiny wallaby called Neil, whose carer Stella is worried may die from stress if they can't find him a companion. Elsewhere, wildlife cameraman Max is in Costa Rica where he gets acquainted with Newbie, a five-month-old three-toed sloth who has suffered from pneumonia since she was rescued. He follows wildlife manager Sam at Kids Saving the Rainforest as she tries to teach the baby sloth to climb trees and learn to go back to the wild.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Viva Ned Flanders. Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) sees his neighbor, aggressively perky born-again Christian Ned Flanders (voice of Harry Shearer), using a senior citizen's discount while shopping, and is convinced Ned is up to something. However, despite his appearance, Homer learns Ned really is sixty years of age, and chalks up his youthful looks to "clean living, chewing thoroughly, and a daily dose of vitamin church!" As Ned looks back at the straight and narrow life he's led, he wonders if there might be something to be learned from Homer's more adventurous way of doing things, and he asks Homer to give him a crash course in having fun. Homer agrees, and takes Ned with him for a trip to Las Vegas, where they gamble, watch stuntman Lance Murdock perform a dangerous motorcycle jump, and Ned has (gasp!) a white wine spritzer. The next morning, Ned and Homer wake up hung-over and disoriented and learn just how eventful their evening was -- they married a pair of cocktail waitresses who aren't interested in breaking up with their new hubbies just yet. First aired on January 10, 1999, "Viva Ned Flanders" features vocal cameos from Graeme Edge, Justin Hayward, John Lodge and Ray Thomas of the Moody Blues as themselves (who are shown playing in Vegas as an opening act for a Moody Blues tribute band)(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The youngest child of the family often has the most problems -- so why should things be different for the Prince of Darkness and his offspring? Satan (Harvey Keitel) is considering retirement, and is pondering which of his sons should take over the family business -- ambitious Adrian (Rhys Ifans), strapping Cassius (Tommy "Tiny" Lister Jr.), or Nicky (Adam Sandler), an accident-prone demon who prefers to stay in his room playing his favorite heavy metal tunes. When Satan decides to stay on for another 10,000 years, Adrian is outraged, and leaves Hell to go to New York, where he and Cassius attempt to round up enough souls to vote Satan out of power. Satan, understandably upset, sends Nicky to bring Adrian and Cassius back home, but Nicky finds life on Earth is more complicated than he expected. Things don't get any easier when he develops a crush on Valerie (Patricia Arquette), a good-hearted mortal woman. Little Nicky also features Michael McKean as a city official trying to put Nicky behind bars, Kevin Nealon as Hell's gatekeeper, Rodney Dangerfield as Satan's father, Robert Smigel as the voice of Beefy -- a talking dog who is Nicky's guide on earth, Allen Covert as Todd -- Nicky's new roommate, and Peter Dante and Jonathan Loughran as a pair of metalheads who dig Satan.

Satan (Harvey Keitel) is considering retirement, and is pondering which of his sons should take over the family business -- ambitious Adrian (Rhys Ifans), strapping Cassius (Tommy "Tiny" Lister Jr.), or Nicky (Adam Sandler), an accident-prone demon who prefers to stay in his room playing his favorite heavy metal tunes. When Satan decides to stay on for another 10,000 years, Adrian is outraged, and leaves Hell to go to New York, where he and Cassius attempt to round up enough souls to vote Satan out of power. Satan, understandably upset, sends Nicky to bring Adrian and Cassius back home, but Nicky finds life on Earth is more complicated than he expected. Things don't get any easier when he develops a crush on Valerie (Patricia Arquette), a good-hearted mortal woman. Little Nicky also features Michael McKean as a city official trying to put Nicky behind bars, Kevin Nealon as Hell's gatekeeper, Rodney Dangerfield as Satan's father, Robert Smigel as the voice of Beefy -- a talking dog who is Nicky's guide on earth, Allen Covert as Todd -- Nicky's new roommate, and Peter Dante and Jonathan Loughran as a pair of metalheads who dig Satan.

    <title lang="en">Shanghai Noon</title>
    <desc lang="en">Jackie Chan has often played a fish out of water, but he's rarely found himself so far upstream as in this comic adventure, in which he puts his fighting skills to the test in the Old West of the 1850s. Lo Fong (Roger Yuan), onetime captain of the Chinese Imperial Guard, has traded upholding the law for smuggling opium. Needing some operating capital, Lo Fong kidnaps the Emperor's daughter, Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu), and takes her to America. When the Emperor sends his best men to find her, Chon Wang (Chan), one of the Emperor's less distinguished guards, insists on joining them; he feels at fault for Lo Fong's capturing the Princess, and he wants to make amends. However, while the rescue party scours the West, Chon Wang gets separated from the group and soon becomes lost. When he crosses paths with Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson), a bright but arrogant train robber, the two become unlikely allies. While Shanghai Noon was billed as Jackie Chan's follow-up to Rush Hour, his first successful American-made feature, it was actually filmed in Canada, as was Chan's breakthrough film in America, the Hong Kong-backed Rumble in the Bronx(n)</desc>

He becomes obsessed from afar with Jenny (Bo Derek), who is engaged to be married. He follows her to Mexico without her knowledge. George arranges a meeting with Jenny by saving the life of her fiancé, David (Sam Jones). Once he has made her acquaintance, George discovers that he is basically too prudish and set in his ways to begin an affair; in addition, Jenny is hardly the "unblemished" girl he thought she was. Sadder but wiser, he returns to the arms of his longtime lady friend "Sam" (Julie Andrews). Beyond renewing the popularity of Maurice Ravel's Bolero and turning Bo Derek into a star, 10 was also one of the most successful Blake Edwards films in years. It is distinguished by the usual quota of cruel slapstick (mostly directed at the accident-prone Moore) and scatological jokes, attractively packaged in Edwards' typical Laurel-and-Hardy deliberate comic pace(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In September 2004, comedian Dave Chappelle took a break from his immensely successful Comedy Central show to stage a free, unpublicized, all-star hip-hop concert in the Clinton Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn, NY. Inviting fans over the Internet, on the street, and even in his family's hometown of Yellow Springs, OH, Chappelle asked filmmaker Michel Gondry to document the event from its inception on through to the performances themselves. The result is Dave Chappelle's Block Party, a concert film that provides not only a sampling of the music on display that September, but also an intimate look at the comedian himself. Gondry's cameras tag along with Chappelle as he visits Ohio, recruits a university marching band to play at the show, and surveys the opinions of Clinton Hill on the show that's about to take place. Along the way, we're introduced to some the comedian's favorite acts, in rehearsals and on-stage: Dead Prez, Jill Scott, Mos Def, the Roots, Erykah Badu, Kanye West, and the surprise reuniting of the Fugees(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Jackie Chan has often played a fish out of water, but he's rarely found himself so far upstream as in this comic adventure, in which he puts his fighting skills to the test in the Old West of the 1850s. Lo Fong (Roger Yuan), onetime captain of the Chinese Imperial Guard, has traded upholding the law for smuggling opium. Needing some operating capital, Lo Fong kidnaps the Emperor's daughter, Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu), and takes her to America. When the Emperor sends his best men to find her, Chon Wang (Chan), one of the Emperor's less distinguished guards, insists on joining them; he feels at fault for Lo Fong's capturing the Princess, and he wants to make amends. However, while the rescue party scours the West, Chon Wang gets separated from the group and soon becomes lost. When he crosses paths with Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson), a bright but arrogant train robber, the two become unlikely allies. While Shanghai Noon was billed as Jackie Chan's follow-up to Rush Hour, his first successful American-made feature, it was actually filmed in Canada, as was Chan's breakthrough film in America, the Hong Kong-backed Rumble in the Bronx(n)</desc>

Max may be a creative boy, but what he doesn't know is that Shark Boy and Lava Girl really do exist, and he is recruited to help them as they do battle against Mr. Electricity, a super-villain determined to deprive children of their sleep. Shot and originally released in the 3-D format, The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl also stars David Arquette and Kristin Davis as Max's parents, and George Lopez as a schoolteacher; writer and director Rodriguez wrote the film's story in collaboration with his then seven-year-old son, Racer Rodriguez(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Good Guy</title>
    <desc lang="en">After executive producing the acclaimed documentary Manda Bala and the J.M. Coetzee adaptation Disgrace, Julio DePietro makes his feature debut as a writer-director with The Good Guy, a drama about ambitious young Wall Streeters fighting each other -- and sometimes their own decent nature -- to get ahead in the world. Our narrator, Tommy (Scott Porter of TV's Friday Night Lights), is young, clever, charming, and attractive. He's got a smart, pretty girlfriend, Beth (Alexis Bledel of Gilmore Girls), an urban conservationist. He's also very good at his investment broker job, impressing his ruthless, cynical boss, Cash (erstwhile "Brat Pack" member Andrew McCarthy). When a key member of Tommy's sales team suddenly leaves for a competitor, Tommy needs to fill his spot quickly, and takes a chance on the bumbling Daniel (Bryan Greenberg, Bride Wars), a former Marine and computer geek who seems a bit naïve about high finance and a bit nervous around women. Tommy takes Daniel under his wing, showing him how to dress, where to socialize, and how to charm attractive women. Their relationship is threatened when Daniel begins spending more time with Beth, joining her book club, and becoming her confidant. Tommy begins to question his decision to share his wisdom with Daniel, while Daniel is forced to decide what success really means to him, and where his loyalties lie. The Good Guy also stars Anna Chlumsky (In the Loop) and Aaron Yoo (Disturbia). The film had its world premiere at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Paradise Road</title>
    <desc lang="en">On February 10, 1942, a military fete held at the Raffles Hotel in Singapore is disrupted when the Japanese bomb the island. All women and children are placed upon a ship. The Japanese sink the vessel and a few survivors end up on the islands of Sumatra where they are promptly captured by the enemy and interned in segregated camps. In one such camp is a multinational group of European women. Featuring a distinguished female cast, this is the uplifting story of how the women overcame their considerable social and personality differences in the face of brutality and deprivation to form a women's choir that sang complex, wordless and symphonic arrangements of classical music. Filmmaker Bruce Beresford spent two years researching the story and interviewing survivors. For the musical sequences, he used the actual musical arrangements of the prisoners. Conditions at the camp are wretched and many of their Japanese guards brutally humiliate and torment the women at every turn. At first the ladies, who come from various walks of life, do not get along, but it doesn't take long before they figure out that the only way to survive is to unite. The vocal orchestra was dreamed up by British inmate Adrienne Pargiter (Glenn Close) who graduated from the royal Academy of Music. She is assisted by fellow music lover Margaret Drummond (Pauline Collins), an Australian missionary. At first no one in camp wants to take the risk involved in singing (which is forbidden), but eventually the other women are coerced into joining. Though the guards sometimes brutally interrupt their practices, the women persist and eventually win some of the guards over with their music. They are eventually allowed to perform publicly(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Murder, She Wrote: A Story to Die For</title>
    <desc lang="en">In this feature-length follow-up to the long-running TV series Murder, She Wrote, homespun mystery novelist Jessica Fletcher (Angela Lansbury) leaves her Cabot Cove residence to attend a big-city writer's conference. As generally happens wherever Jessica shows up, a murder takes place; in this instance, the victim is a former KGB agent (Duncan Regehr) who was about to publish his tell-all memoirs. Teaming up with fellow author Warren Pierce (Richard Crenna), Jessica sets about to solve the murder -- much to the dismay of the local constabulary. Allegedly written as far back as 1998 (by Babylon 5 stalwart J. Michael Straczynski), Murder, She Wrote: A Story to Die For finally arrived on the CBS prime-time manifest on May 18, 2000(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Murder, She Wrote: The Celtic Riddle</title>
    <desc lang="en">This fourth TV movie inspired by the classic, long-running mystery series Murder, She Wrote is also the first based on a novel, namely Lyn Hamilton's The Celtic Riddle. Angela Lansbury recreates her role as mystery writer-cum-amateur sleuth Jessica B. Fletcher, who on this occasion has journeyed to Ireland, there to attend the reading of the will of an old friend. Naturally, the bequeathing is chock-full of bizarre conditions and codicils, but the reading itself takes second place to the series of murders which follow. The police do their usual "thorough" investigation and come up with nothing, leaving it to Jessica to assemble the clues, many of which are maddeningly cryptic, and all of which are somehow linked to a huge hidden treasure. Filmed on location, Murder, She Wrote: The Celtic Riddle first aired May 9, 2003, on CBS(n)</desc>

In a bid to further their careers, they've made a pact with the Devil: one that requires the soul of a virgin. They kidnap and kill Jennifer, but unfortunately she was no virgin - and she rises again as a literal man-eater to take terrible retribution by ravenously rampaging her way through the school. Only one person stands a chance of halting the carnage: Jennifer's best friend Anita 'Needy' Lesnicky, who's nerdy, for sure, but also may have the strength of character to succeed where others have been ingested...

    <desc lang="en">Italy v Ireland (Kick-off 2.25pm). Mark Pougatch presents coverage of the opening match in the second round of fixtures, which takes place at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome. Ireland start as favourites against the Azzurri and have only lost one Six Nations to the Italians, which occurred in 2013 at this stadium. Italy are now coached by former Ireland full-back Conor O'Shea, which should add an extra element to proceedings, but anything less than an away win would see Ireland's chance of glory being significantly damaged. With analysis from Brian O'Driscoll, Jonny Wilkinson, Lawrence Dallaglio, Martin Bayfield, Maggie Alphonsi and Marco Bortolami, and commentary by Nick Mullins, Gordon D'Arcy and Ben Kay.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">One of the most devastating pandemics in human history, the Black Death swept through London in 1348, killing old and young, rich and poor, within days of their first symptoms. Received wisdom has long suggested the culprit was bubonic plague, spread by the fleas of infected rats, and an unexpected discovery made by Crossrail engineers working on a shaft on the edge of London's Charterhouse Square in 2013 provides a new insight into how the disease passed from host to host. This documentary follows experts from a range of disciplines as they pick through the evidence, reveal why the disease killed on such a large scale, and discuss how it still poses a threat today.(n)</desc>

As the team investigates the scene of the crime, they realise a rare painting found in the admiral's office is actually an elaborate fake placed there after the killing, replacing the stolen original. As the quest to locate the missing artwork gets under way, the agents realise they need the help of an expert. Luckily, Tony's con-artist father has returned to town, having broken up with his fiancee, and is on hand to provide expert advice as the hunt for the killer takes them into the shady world of the black market. Guest starring Robert Wagner.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Italy v Ireland.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Italy v Ireland (Kick-off 2.25pm). Coverage of the opening match in the second round of fixtures, which takes place at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome. Ireland start as favourites against the Azzurri and have only lost one Six Nations to the Italians, which occurred in 2013 at this stadium. Italy are now coached by former Ireland full-back Conor O'Shea, which should add an extra element to proceedings, but anything less than an away win would see Ireland's chance of glory being significantly damaged. Presented by Daire O'Brien, with commentary by Hugh Cahill and Ralph Keyes, analysis from Brent Pope, Eddie O'Sullivan and Shane Horgan, and reports by Donal Lenihan.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The veteran naturalist examines the world of flight, travelling across the globe to chart the evolutionary story of those creatures who seemingly defy the rules of gravity by taking to the air. Initially focusing on insects, Attenborough meets a descendant of the dragonfly, before examining the Atlas beetle, which tends to restrict flight to times when it needs a mate or a fresh supply of food. More aesthetically pleasing is a group of beautiful tropical butterflies, followed by an in-depth study into the blow fly - the jet fighter of insects.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The dangerous patients at a maximum-security mental hospital break free from their rooms during a power failure, and embark on a grisly murder rampage that's destined to be remembered as one of the worst ever committed. Fifteen years ago, an elusive serial killer known as The Wolf claimed the lives of 15 young girls. Thanks to the work of Detectives Elliott Carbon (John Rhys-Davies) and Johnny Morgan ( Andrew Cymek), The Wolf was eventually captured, locked up, and placed in the care of Dr. Parker (William B. Davis). When the facility loses power and the lights go dark, however, The Wolf and the rest of the inmates seize the opportunity to reclaim their freedom. Now trapped in these winding corridors with a rampaging gang of maniacs, madmen, and murderers, Johnny and Dr. Parker must fight to survive the night, and ensure that no one escapes before order is restored(n)</desc>

Determined to salvage their troubled relationship, Jenn's boyfriend Alex (Jeff Roop) takes them to a secluded campsite near a scenic lake where he used to play as a child.

It's Halloween night, and four friends -- Allison (Vanessa Horneff), Elliott (Wil Horneff), Trevor (Karl Jacob), and Brian (Sean Reid) -- are on a road trip en route to a friend's wedding when their car breaks down after running into something. Looking for help, the four happen upon the farmhouse of an elderly couple, Elvin (Richard Little) and May (Barbara Wilhide), which is located next to a huge barn. Elvin and May have already become lost in the darkness of the barn, and soon two of the lost travelers are suffering the same fate as they search for friendly strangers. However, while they can barely see a hand in front of their face, they discover they're not alone in the barn, which has become home to a huge swarm of bloodthirsty bats. The Roost is framed by an introduction and postscript from a television horror show host, played by Tom Noonan(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Hills Have Eyes</title>
    <desc lang="en">Horror auteur Wes Craven followed his threadbare but horrifically compelling cult classic Last House on the Left with this wonderfully demented morality fable about a bloody war of attrition between two extremely different families. The story opens on the journey of the Carters, a mildly dysfunctional extended family led by patriarch "Big Bob" Carter (Russ Grieve), as they travel across the California desert in search of an inherited silver mine. When a broken axle leaves them stranded in the middle of a former nuclear testing site, their attempts to find help lead them unwittingly into the territory of a savage family of cave-dwelling cannibals, the apparent progeny of the bearlike Jupiter (James Whitworth) and an abducted prostitute. Jupiter's eldest son Pluto (professional movie weirdo Michael Berryman) leads the first brutal attack on the defenseless Carters who, through necessity, are driven to equally extreme measures in order to survive. Though the film is not overtly bloody, the scenes depicting this confrontation are rendered with an unflinching directness, and the violations visited on the Carters are so brutal as to make the survivors' regression into savagery all the more convincing. No one is spared from the nightmare: Jupiter's boys have even kidnapped the youngest member of the Carter family -- a mere infant -- to serve as fodder for their next barbecue, and the baby becomes the main point of contention between the rival clans. Craven nevertheless refuses to take the easy way out by depicting his "monsters" as soullessly evil; parallels between either family's "values" are clearly drawn as the differences between the two clans begin to blur(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Meskada</title>
    <desc lang="en">Class and economics muddy the investigation of a homicide in this thriller from director Josh Sternfeld. When a child is found murdered in the small town of Hilliard, police detective Noah Cordin (Nick Stahl) is assigned to investigate the case. The victim's mother, Allison Connor (Laura Benanti), is a wealthy and well-connected member of the County Board of Commissioners, so Cordin is under pressure to find the killer as soon as possible, but working with rookie officer Leslie Spencer (Rachel Nichols), he isn't finding many substantial clues. One of the few pieces of evidence suggests the culprit may have been from the nearby town of Caswell. Cordin was born and raised in Caswell and knows its history well -- while Hilliard is a prosperous suburban community, Caswell is a working-class town fallen on hard times, and its survival is dependent on a proposed factory coming into town. As Cordin spends more and more time in Caswell, he becomes a target for the resentment the locals feel toward their wealthier neighbors, and a tense situation becomes potentially explosive when word begins to circulate that Connor may use her influence to keep the new employer out of Caswell unless someone comes forward to identity who killed her son. Meskada (named for the county that contains both Hilliard and Caswell) also stars Norman Reedus, Kellan Lutz, Jonathan Tucker, and Grace Gummer(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Director Justin Lin again takes the helm for the fifth helping in the high-octane Fast &amp; Furious action-thriller franchise starring Vin Diesel and the late Paul Walker. This time around, car-thieving bad boy Dominic Toretto escapes the clutches of the law in order to attempt a career-crowning heist. He hooks up with his cop-turned-robber pal Brian O'Conner to relieve Brazil's most corrupt businessman of his vast, ill-gotten fortune - after which the buddies plan to live a very quiet, extremely comfortable life. However, it's going to be a tricky job to pull off, so they enlist a bunch of associates from their previous (mis)adventures and head south. But to succeed they'll have to evade the FBI's Luke Hobbs, who is determined to bring their crime spree to an end, and is closing in on them fast. Well, that's the plot, but of course, as with its predecessors, the film is really all about the stunts, the testosterone-fuelled car action and silly macho strutting..(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Devil</title>
    <desc lang="en">Forced into a corner, backs against the wall - a season of action, suspense and dread in confined surroundings. Supernatural chiller starring Chris Messina as a cop who discovers that four people are trapped in a lift with the Devil incarnate. Dowdle and screenwriter Brian Nelson tackle the first instalment of "The Night Chronicles," a film series in which up-and-coming filmmakers bring to life stories conceived by M. Night Shyamalan. Devil opens as five Philadelphia office workers file into the lift of an office building. A security guard - who can see, but not hear, what's going on in the suspended box - tries to convince the cop on the case that one of the passengers is the Devil, taking human form in his quest to collect sinners. As emergency workers frantically try to open the lift, secrets are revealed and the five realise that their only hope for survival is to confess their darkest sins in front of the others(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A father destroyed by the death of his son finds inspiration in the most unexpected of places in the feature directorial debut of veteran actor William H. Macy, who co-authored the screenplay with Casey Twenter and Jeff Robison. In the wake of his son's death, successful advertising executive Sam (Billy Crudup) moves aboard a docked sailboat, and drifts into an alcohol-induced haze. Something deep within Sam begins to stir however, when he discovers his late son's demo tapes, and decides to take a listen. Deeply moved by his son's artistry and determined not to let the boy's dreams die with him, Sam determines to learn each song note-for-note, and later summons the courage to perform one of them publicly. That performance, in turn, prompts aspiring musician Quentin (Anton Yelchin) to approach Sam, and together they form a band that transforms their lives in ways neither ever dreamt possible. Selena Gomez, Felicity Huffman, and Laurence Fishburne co-star(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Salute</title>
    <desc lang="en">To many, Peter Norman is best known as a seemingly unwitting participant in a historic photograph: during the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City, Africa-American runners Tommie Smith and John Carlos, who had respectively won the Gold and Bronze medals in the 200 Meter Dash, raised their fists during the medal presentation ceremony in what was recognized as the "Black Power Salute" as Australian Norman, who had won the silver medal, stood beside them. What few noticed is that Norman wore a patch identifying himself as a member of the Olympic Project For Human Rights on his warm-up suit, and he publicly and privately supported Smith and Carlos during what became a controversial moment in a year of world-wide political turmoil. Filmmaker Matt Norman, who is Peter Norman's nephew, offers a profile of Norman, his role in Smith and Carlos's famous moment of protest, and his life as an athlete and activist in the documentary Salute. The film also examines the events that led up to the 1968 Mexico City Olympics -- political assassinations in America, rioting in Mexico, the adoption of civil rights legislation in Australia -- and how the athletes at the games responded. Salute received its world premiere at the 2008 Sydney Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Twilight Zone</title>
    <sub-title lang="en">Twenty-two</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Twenty-two. This videotaped Twilight Zone episode is a variation on a most familiar theme. While in the hospital recovering from a nervous breakdown, dancer Liz Powell (Barbara Nichols) is tortured by a recurring nightmare. In this nocturnal vision, Liz is escorted by a mysterious nurse (Arline Sax) to "Room 22" -- the hospital morgue. The dream always ends as the nurse says insinuatingly, "Room for one more, honey." If all this sounds familiar, it may be because the basic story was used in the 1945 British horror film Dead of Night, which in turn drew its inspiration from an anecdote in Bennett Cerf's Famous Ghost Stories. Future Lost in Space regular Jonathan Harris also appears in "Twenty-Two," which was adapted for television by Rod Serling and was originally telecast February 10, 1961(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">His wife convicted of a murder she swears she did not commit, a college professor plots to break her out of prison in this thriller starring Russell Crowe and Liam Neeson. John Brennan (Crowe) and his wife, Lara (Elizabeth Banks), were happily married and raising a family when their lives fell apart in the blink of an eye. Lara has been charged with murder, and despite every effort to prove her innocence, the judge sentences her to an extended prison sentence. Meanwhile, on the outside, John files multiple appeals while struggling to raise their children and maintain his career. Lara's future starts to look especially grim, however, after the final appeal is rejected, and she admits that she'd rather commit suicide than spend the rest of her life behind bars. Determined to save his wife after the justice system fails her, John seeks the advice of ex-convict Damon Pennington (Liam Neeson), who staged his own daring prison escape, in order to draw up an airtight plan. Later, John prepares to put his life on the line for the woman he loves, and sets the plan into motion with the knowledge that one false move could be their last(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A struggling writer unlocks the full potential of his brain by taking a cutting-edge pharmaceutical, only to find that his newfound abilities have made him a target for some of the most greedy and dangerous men on the planet. Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) is an author without a novel. No matter how hard he tries, he just can't summon the inspiration to write a single word. That all changes when an old friend wanders back into Eddie's life, and opens his eyes to a powerful new drug called NZT. The moment Eddie takes NZT, his brain begins functioning at 100 percent, giving him the ability to quickly recall every event in his life down to the smallest detail, learn new languages in a flash, and harness the untapped power of complex mathematical equations. But when Eddie's supply of NZT runs out, the party is over. Of course, it doesn't take Eddie long to make a mint on Wall Street, and when he does, it draws the attention of Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro), one of the world's most powerful and prominent businessmen. With Eddie's help, Carl plots to arbitrate a complex corporate merger that will shake the establishment to its very core. Just as the deal is about to be brokered, however, some dangerous characters discover Eddie's secret and come gunning for his dwindling supply of medicine. Now, if Eddie can just endure the debilitating side effects of NZT long enough to run for his life, he may just survive to see another day(n)</desc>
