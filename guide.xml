    <desc lang="en">Biopic of Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper), the most-celebrated sniper in American military history. In the aftermath of 9/11, Kyle decides to serve his country by becoming a Navy SEAL. But with each tour of duty, he grows more detached from his wife and children. As the story opens, we meet carefree brothers Chris and Jeff (Keir O'Donnell) as they work the Texas rodeo circuit. They're cowboys through and through, and despite being notably older than the usual enlistee, Chris pays a visit to his local recruitment office and decides to become a Navy SEAL. Later, at the firing range, he draws on his hunting lessons with his stern father to become an expert marksman. A booze-fueled barroom chat with pretty brunette Taya (Sienna Miller) soon leads to wedding bells, and following the terrorist attacks of 9/11, Kyle is deployed to Iraq for his first tour of duty. There, his reputation as a sniper who never misses makes him a legend among his fellow troops, and earns him the moniker "The Devil of Ramadi" from his enemies. With a substantial bounty on his head, Kyle makes it his personal mission to take out a sadistic Iraqi soldier known as "The Butcher," as well as an elusive enemy marksman with a skill to rival his own. The closer he gets to achieving his goals during repeat tours of duty, however, the more fellow soldiers he sees die, and the further he drifts from Taya and their two children back home. It all leads up to a tense rooftop gunfight in a raging sandstorm -- one that convinces the sniper once and for all to make his family his top priority. Unfortunately, all is not well as Kyle struggles to make the transition back to civilian life, but he discovers that helping his fellow veterans is an effective way to do good and make peace with his wartime experiences(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Flight 93</title>
    <desc lang="en">Although al-Qaida terrorists hijacked four commercial airliners on September 11, 2001, only three reached their intended targets. United Airlines Flight 93, a Boeing 757 that departed late from Newark to San Francisco, crash-landed near Pittsburgh instead of becoming a weapon against the White House or the United States Capitol. This speculative cable-TV docudrama imagines how the flight might have played out for the flight's passengers, who are believed to have risen up against their hijackers after being alerted to the other terrorist attacks via cell phone. Unfolding in more or less real time, Flight 93 depicts the hijacking from the viewpoints of those on the flight and those on the ground. Tom Burnett (Jeffrey Nordling), Mark Bingham (Ty Olsson), Todd Beamer (Brennan Elliott), and many of the flight's other, posthumously famous passengers are portrayed, as are their families, law-enforcement agents, air-traffic controllers, United employees, and cell-phone company personnel. Flight 93 originally aired in January 2006 on the A&amp;E cable network, several months after the Discovery Channel debuted its documentary The Flight That Fought Back and several months before the feature film United 93 premiered(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Angelina Jolie directs this true-life tale of Louis Zamperini, the Olympic track star who survived a plane crash in World War II, only to fight for his life against nature and eventually as a prisoner of war. Joel and Ethan Coen provide the script. Louis (Jack O'Connell) grows up a rough-hewn kid on the verge of becoming a full-on delinquent, until his brother starts training him to be a track star. Louis excels at the sport, and eventually represents America at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. During his training, he learns to become resilient and disciplined; his brother's words of advice, "If you can take it, you can make it," push him to overcome any adversity. He must live up to that adage under the most extreme circumstances after his plane is shot down during another bombing raid. He is stranded at sea for more than a month, only to be found by the Japanese and forced to endure constant physical abuse at the hands of sadistic prison-camp guard Mutsuhiro Watanabe (Japanese pop star Miyavi), who wants to break Louis' indomitable spirit(n)</desc>

Using David Copperfield as a starting point, he unpicks the language and the revolution of a master storyteller, and with the help of funnymen Barry Cryer, Kevin Eldon and Phill Jupitus, he gets beneath the skin of some of the more outlandish characters. Finally, through encounters with the types of people Dickens wrote about, including lawyers and a debtor, Iannucci claims that his stories are just as relevant today.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Brick</title>
    <desc lang="en">A tough-talking teen attempts to uncover his ex-girlfriend's killer in director Rian Johnson's hard-boiled high-school noir, told in the style of a Dashiell Hammett mystery. An outsider by nature, Brendan (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is forced to penetrate the elaborate ranks of the high-school social scene and its more insidious underbelly when the body of his former girlfriend Emily is found lying lifeless in a remote creek. Though the pair had been on the outs, Brendan can't seem to shake the hysterical phone call that he received from Emily the day before her body was discovered, a call in which she rattled off a number of cryptic words: "brick," "pin," "tug," "poor Frisco." He's determined to find the guilty party, and to do that he'll need to uncover the meaning behind her enigmatic phone call. From the highest-ranking athlete to the lowest-level burnout, no one is above suspicion of leaving her in that creek or putting her in the position to end up there. Brendan's skill for getting the right attention from the right people leads him to a local drug dealer of urban-legendary status (Lukas Haas), who walks with a cane and lives with his mother. As Brendan infiltrates the social and political web more deeply, his theory solidifies and each player's role becomes clear, from the shifty-eyed pot slinger to an upper-crust innocent who may well be a femme fatale. Brendan may soon be ready to make his case, even if it's too late for him to get out(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">American Sniper</title>
    <desc lang="en">Biopic of Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper), the most-celebrated sniper in American military history. In the aftermath of 9/11, Kyle decides to serve his country by becoming a Navy SEAL. But with each tour of duty, he grows more detached from his wife and children. As the story opens, we meet carefree brothers Chris and Jeff (Keir O'Donnell) as they work the Texas rodeo circuit. They're cowboys through and through, and despite being notably older than the usual enlistee, Chris pays a visit to his local recruitment office and decides to become a Navy SEAL. Later, at the firing range, he draws on his hunting lessons with his stern father to become an expert marksman. A booze-fueled barroom chat with pretty brunette Taya (Sienna Miller) soon leads to wedding bells, and following the terrorist attacks of 9/11, Kyle is deployed to Iraq for his first tour of duty. There, his reputation as a sniper who never misses makes him a legend among his fellow troops, and earns him the moniker "The Devil of Ramadi" from his enemies. With a substantial bounty on his head, Kyle makes it his personal mission to take out a sadistic Iraqi soldier known as "The Butcher," as well as an elusive enemy marksman with a skill to rival his own. The closer he gets to achieving his goals during repeat tours of duty, however, the more fellow soldiers he sees die, and the further he drifts from Taya and their two children back home. It all leads up to a tense rooftop gunfight in a raging sandstorm -- one that convinces the sniper once and for all to make his family his top priority. Unfortunately, all is not well as Kyle struggles to make the transition back to civilian life, but he discovers that helping his fellow veterans is an effective way to do good and make peace with his wartime experiences(n)</desc>

Steve Martin plays Vinnie Antonelli, a street smart mobster who agrees to turn state's evidence and is forced to move to Fryburg, California as part of the witness relocation program. Rick Moranis plays the nebbish FBI agent Barney Coopersmith, who is assigned to help Vinnie adjust to small town life. Instead, Vinnie helps Barney come out of his shell, much to the consternation of divorced mother and relentless district attorney Hannah Stubbs (Joan Cusack)(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">American Sniper</title>
    <desc lang="en">Biopic of Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper), the most-celebrated sniper in American military history. In the aftermath of 9/11, Kyle decides to serve his country by becoming a Navy SEAL. But with each tour of duty, he grows more detached from his wife and children. As the story opens, we meet carefree brothers Chris and Jeff (Keir O'Donnell) as they work the Texas rodeo circuit. They're cowboys through and through, and despite being notably older than the usual enlistee, Chris pays a visit to his local recruitment office and decides to become a Navy SEAL. Later, at the firing range, he draws on his hunting lessons with his stern father to become an expert marksman. A booze-fueled barroom chat with pretty brunette Taya (Sienna Miller) soon leads to wedding bells, and following the terrorist attacks of 9/11, Kyle is deployed to Iraq for his first tour of duty. There, his reputation as a sniper who never misses makes him a legend among his fellow troops, and earns him the moniker "The Devil of Ramadi" from his enemies. With a substantial bounty on his head, Kyle makes it his personal mission to take out a sadistic Iraqi soldier known as "The Butcher," as well as an elusive enemy marksman with a skill to rival his own. The closer he gets to achieving his goals during repeat tours of duty, however, the more fellow soldiers he sees die, and the further he drifts from Taya and their two children back home. It all leads up to a tense rooftop gunfight in a raging sandstorm -- one that convinces the sniper once and for all to make his family his top priority. Unfortunately, all is not well as Kyle struggles to make the transition back to civilian life, but he discovers that helping his fellow veterans is an effective way to do good and make peace with his wartime experiences(n)</desc>

Narrated by American Justice host and producer Bill Kurtis, this episode goes inside the investigation of the two murders that Walker and her boyfriend Daniel Ryan Garrett committed. The trial of Walker is shown through exclusive footage. After the conviction, American Justice follows her through her daily life, showing her prison surroundings and talking with her about her crimes. Sentenced to death, while Walker was waiting to be executed, she became a born-again Christian. Her lawyers used this transformation as leverage to try to get her death sentence reduced to life in prison. Their attempts were unsuccessful and Walker was killed by lethal injection in February 1998. American Justice also shows interviews with lawyers and law enforcement professionals who knew Walker(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Dead Woman Walking: The Karla Faye Tucker Story. This documentary, part of the American Justice series from A&amp;E, examines the Texas death penalty case of Karla Faye Walker. Narrated by American Justice host and producer Bill Kurtis, this episode goes inside the investigation of the two murders that Walker and her boyfriend Daniel Ryan Garrett committed. The trial of Walker is shown through exclusive footage. After the conviction, American Justice follows her through her daily life, showing her prison surroundings and talking with her about her crimes. Sentenced to death, while Walker was waiting to be executed, she became a born-again Christian. Her lawyers used this transformation as leverage to try to get her death sentence reduced to life in prison. Their attempts were unsuccessful and Walker was killed by lethal injection in February 1998. American Justice also shows interviews with lawyers and law enforcement professionals who knew Walker(n)</desc>

Once Bernie and his team of mechanics have serviced the engine, the car is taken to a rolling road to put it through its paces, before former racing driver Paul O'Neill assesses its value to see if all the work has been worthwhile.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Hindenburg was one of the great engineering feats of the early 20th century, but on May 6, 1937, disaster struck when the airship crashed in New Jersey, killing 35 of the 97 people on board. Ever since, the cause of the tragedy has remained a mystery, with a static electric charge, a design flaw and an act of sabotage all blamed by experts. In this programme, a team including aeronautical engineer Jem Stansfield puts the leading theories to the test with the help of three scale models.(n)</desc>

The British were outnumbered by more than 10 to one, but soon pushed the Axis forces back hundreds of miles and Hitler had to send Field Marshal Erwin Rommel and the Afrika Korps to rescue his ally. Alongside the campaign on the ground, Mussolini staged an epic naval and air war in the Mediterranean, which saw the British fighting to hold on to the strategically vital island of Malta.(n)</desc>

Darryl Walker (Damon Wayans) is a bright but socially inept man with a gift for inventing things but little skill for functioning in the real world. His brother Kevin (David Alan Grier) works on a low-class tabloid news show featuring beautiful anchorwoman Kimberley Jonz (Robin Givens), whom he secretly loves. The Walkers live in Metro City, Illinois, a city that's been hit with a massive crime wave after the mayor is kidnapped by gangsters. After his grandmother is killed, Darryl builds a collection of crime-fighting robots from household junk, invents bullet-proof long underwear (made from his grandmother's old housecoat), and becomes Metro City's newest crime fighter, Blankman. Blankman's escapades put fear into the heart of mob boss Michael Minelli (Jon Polito), and when Kevin turns out to have an inside track on Blankman's activities, it brings him closer to Kimberley. But how long can a superhero with no superpowers last against the forces of organized crime? Damon Wayans wrote the original story for Blankman as well as co-writing the screenplay and playing the title role, which was based in part on his "Handi-Man" character from the TV comedy series In Living Color(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This daily show-biz gossip and "expose" series was a spinoff of the popular interactive website TMZ, an acronym for the "Thirty Mile Zone" surrounding Hollywood. Created in 2005, TMZ had gained national prominence by breaking the story of Mel Gibson's anti-Semitic tirade after his arrest for drunken driving. By the time the TV version of TMZ premiered the week of September 10, 2007, the operation had once again scooped its scandal-rag competition with its coverage of O.J. Simpson's profanity-laden "invasion" of the home of a collectibles dealer who was allegedly selling Simpson memorabilia without permission. In fact, TMZ on TV had a wealth of celebrity-meltdown yarns to choose from during its shakedown week, ranging from the substance-abuse problems of Lindsay Lohan to the ill-fated "comeback" concert of Britney Spears. Harvey Levin, managing editor for both versions of TMZ, appeared on-camera as a correspondent, along with Sean Borg, Michael Hundgen, Katie Darryl and Teresa Strasser.

    <desc lang="en">A woman wonders if it's just friendship or real love she feels when a close male friend announces he's tying the knot in this romantic comedy. Dre (Taye Diggs) and Sidney (Sanaa Lathan) became best friends when they were ten years old -- the same time that both first became aware of the first rumblings of the Hip Hop revolution in New York City. Today, Dre runs a successful record label, and Sidney is a respected music journalist; both have managed to turn their love for the music into careers, and both are still close friends. Close enough, in fact, that many of their pals wonder why they've never become boyfriend and girlfriend. While both have always denied their attraction to one another, Sidney begins to have second thoughts when Dre proposes to his girlfriend Reese (Nicole Ari Parker), a lawyer. Even though Sidney has a relationship of her own with professional basketball player Kelby (Boris Kodjoe), as Dre's wedding draws closer, Sidney begins to suspect that her longtime best friend is actually the love of her life. Brown Sugar features supporting performances form real life Hip Hop stars Mos Def and Queen Latifah; former basketball star Earvin "Magic" Johnson served as executive producer(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">I Now Pronounce You Chuck &amp; Larry</title>
    <desc lang="en">When two testosterone-fueled firemen attempt to register as domestic partners in order to bypass the bureaucratic red tape preventing one of them from naming his own two children as his life-insurance beneficiaries, their low-key ruse turns into headline news in this quirky matrimonial comedy starring Adam Sandler and Kevin James. Chuck Levine (Sandler) and Larry Valentine (James) are two New York City firefighters whose longtime friendship has endured many a five-alarm fire. All that widower Larry wants is to ensure that his two children will be taken care of if anything should happen to him on the job, and all that single blaze-battler Chuck wants is to carry on with his carefree life of noncommitment. Having once rescued Larry from certain death in a particularly fearsome inferno, beholden Chuck feels forever indebted to his brave friend and has vowed to repay the favor when the time is right. When Larry discovers that the only means of circumventing the civic red tape that could throw his children's futures into jeopardy is to take Chuck as his lawfully wedded husband, his obligated pal reluctantly agrees to step up to the alter with the understanding that the arrangement will be a well-kept secret between themselves and the justice of the peace. A potentially fatal flaw in their presumably foolproof plan is soon revealed, however, when an overzealous bureaucrat decides to question Chuck and Larry's partnership. Subsequently forced to embark on a mandatory honeymoon and pose as starry-eyed newlyweds, Chuck and Larry quickly discover just how important it can be to stick by a friend in his or her time of need. Jessica Biel, Steve Buscemi, Ving Rhames, and Dan Aykroyd co-star in a comedy from The Benchwarmers director Dennis Dugan(n)</desc>

Quentin Conners (Jason Statham) is a veteran police detective who is less than pleased when he's assigned a new partner, Shane Dekker (Ryan Phillippe). While Conners has been with the force for years, Dekker is a rookie, and it doesn't take Conners long to realize his partner has a lot to learn about the nuts and bolts of investigation. However, the two are forced to put aside their differences when they're given an important new case to crack -- a brilliant thief (Wesley Snipes) has masterminded a series of high-stakes bank heists, and the police are baffled as to how he seems to know what they're up to just as soon as they do. Chaos also stars Justine Waddell as a police officer who has become involved with one of the detectives(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Who Done It?</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Who Done It?. The Three Stooges play inept detectives in this Columbia comedy. Wealthy Mr. Goodrich (Emil Sitka) is very nervous because the Phantom Gang has been knocking off men just like himself, and he has been informed that he will be next. He frantically calls the Alert Detective Agency because the detectives he has hired are late. It turns out they are the Stooges, who have been robbed and bound. With the help of the security guard, they free themselves and head for Mr. Goodrich's home. Unfortunately, the old man has already been knocked unconscious and they're greeted by the gang, one of whom is Goodrich's butler. The female member (Christine McIntyre) claims to be Goodrich's niece, and sneaks poison into Shemp's drink, sending him into a spasmodic (and very funny) fit. A big goon proceeds to chase the Stooges up and down the halls of the house, but they manage to evade him long enough to find Mr. Goodrich in a hidden panel. "A corpus!" says Shemp. But Goodrich isn't dead, merely stunned -- he's a fine music lover and the gang tortured him by forcing him to listen to singing commercials. The crooks gang up on them and Goodrich turns out the lights. The ensuing melee goes on in darkness, punctuated whenever someone lights a match (generally to say a one-liner). When the lights come back on, the crooks have all been knocked cold, thanks to Shemp's use of a small fireplace shovel. While showing off his moves, he knocks the other Stooges and Goodrich unconscious. Dismayed by what he's done, he knocks himself out, too(n)</desc>

They play paperhangers working in the Kingdom of Moronica. After overthrowing the king, evil cabinet ministers elect Moe Hailstone new ruler, naturally counting on his stupidity. Moe becomes Dictator ("Moronica must expand! We shall lend our neighbors a helping hand, we shall lend them two helping hands ... and help ourselves to the neighbors!"); Larry is named Minister of Propaganda (Moe: " What do you mean by reading a book? Loyal Moronicans shouldn't read! Take your troops out and burn every book!"); and Curly becomes Field Marshall. A glamorous female spy (Lorna Gray aka Adrian Booth) gets in the way of governing and the Stooges are run out of the country by the mob.

Thanks to the Stooges' alertness and keen powers of observation, Junior is stolen right from under their noses. Realizing that the "kidnapper" is Mrs. Lloyd's estranged husband George, the Stooges race to the rescue--leading to a surprisingly touching finale (with a bit of the usual slapstick tossed in). The film's highlights include a running gag wherein Shemp stands on his head to stop Junior from crying, and an elongated routine involving "soap-bubble soup"(n)</desc>

This year, he begins by welcoming Oscar-winning actress Renee Zellweger and Grey's Anatomy heart-throb Patrick Dempsey to the studio. The pair are starring together in the latest Bridget Jones film, Bridget Jones's Baby, in which the unlucky-in-love Londoner finds herself back on the singles market - just in time to discover she's expecting. Also making an appearance are actor, director and producer John Malkovich, actress and comedienne Aisling Bea, and a selection of Team GB's Olympic heroes, namely the women's hockey team, and cyclist couple Laura Trott and Jason Kenny. Plus, Brit Award-winning singer-songwriter Tom Odell performs live.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Kevin McCloud revisits a memorable restoration project in the remote Creuse region of central France. Back in 2003, when Denise Daniel and Doug Ibbs gave up everything in the UK to start a new life abroad, they couldn't have known what was ahead of them. Falling in love with a dilapidated manor house with just four crumbling walls and half a roof, they embarked on a mission to transform it - working day and night, doing everything themselves, year after year - until slowly but surely they created a magnificent edifice out of the ruins they bought off the internet. On the 70th anniversary of the destruction of the original 19th-century building by the German army, the house finally took its finished form.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">White Tiger Trouble. The busy summer season is in full swing at the DeYoung Family Zoo, a large private zoo in the middle of nowhere, Michigan. With crowds pouring in, Bud and Carrie struggle to keep up. Their to-do lists grow longer and longer by the minute. And Emo, an inbred white tiger needs to be neutered before he spreads genetic defects to future generations. Bud and Carrie struggle to prepare an operating room but it's one interruption after another - a car show by the lion pen, a pampered potbellied pig, a dog who got in a fight with a porcupine and a litter of fox kits that need their help. Finally, the operating room is ready and the vet arrives. But the surgery is not without complications(n)</desc>

Just as Bud and Carrie prepare for the arrival of the newest member of the zoo, Michigans Upper Peninsula is hit with an early and unusually harsh winter storm. But life never stops when youve got over four hundred mouths to feed? There are cages to clean, enclosures to shovel out, and a wild stallion that needs rescuing from a neighbors farm. As temperatures continue to fall, a snow white tiger's pregnancy leads both to joy and tragedy(n)</desc>

On top of their day-to-day chores, the two are busy preparing for the arrival of their latest, largest attraction, a baby hippo. There's a lot of work to be done before he arrives. But when an unsuspecting chicken wanders into the tiger pen and a cat hoarder dies leaving a house of feral cats in need of good homes, Bud and Carrie must step in. Things really get tense with the arrival of distressing news: the cost to ship the hippo has gone up? a lot. Bud and Carrie will have to raise the funds, pray for a miracle or break their promise of bringing a baby hippopotamus to Michigan's Upper Peninsula(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Hot Rod</title>
    <desc lang="en">Akiva Schaffer's slapstick comedy stars Andy Samberg as Rod Kimble, a daredevil motorcycle stunt rider in the mould of Evel Knievel. Well, not quite - most of his stunts end in disaster and he lives as home with his stepdad Frank Powell and mum Marie. But, when his overbearing stepfather needs $50,000 for a heart operation, Rod swears to raise the cash somehow. Initial efforts, including a stint as a children's entertainer and as a daredevil show at the local swimming pool, end in abject failure. But Rod, unbowed, goes for the big one: he aims to jump 15 school buses (one more than Knievel). Samberg is an alumnus of Saturday Night Live, and the show's wacky humour translates well to this picaresque comedy that never flags(n)</desc>

Well, not quite - most of his stunts end in disaster and he lives as home with his stepdad Frank Powell and mum Marie. But, when his overbearing stepfather needs $50,000 for a heart operation, Rod swears to raise the cash somehow. Initial efforts, including a stint as a children's entertainer and as a daredevil show at the local swimming pool, end in abject failure. But Rod, unbowed, goes for the big one: he aims to jump 15 school buses (one more than Knievel). Samberg is an alumnus of Saturday Night Live, and the show's wacky humour translates well to this picaresque comedy that never flags(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">When a hard-luck blue-collar worker and his two best friends are mistaken for Army Reservists by a tough-talking Army sergeant, the plane set to fly them to the front lines of Iraq mistakenly drops them in the middle of Mexico to disastrous results in a freewheeling military comedy starring Larry the Cable Guy, Bill Engvall, and D.J. Qualls. Larry (the Cable Guy) has lost his job and his woman in the short span of 24 hours. Convinced that some suds and target shooting are just the right remedies for a broken, jobless heart, Larry sets out with his next-door neighbor Bill (Engvall) and their trigger-happy pal Everett (Qualls) in order to blast off some rounds and down some brews. Their relaxing weekend soon takes an unexpected turn, however, when hard-case Army sergeant Kilgrove (Keith David) mistakes the trio as slacking Army reservists and loads them in a plane bound for Fallujah. Subsequently air-dropped over Mexico due to pilot error, the clueless, wannabe war heroes become convinced that they're actually in the Middle East and set out to save a rural village from what they assume to be an insurgent uprising. Though the thankful locals champion the noble but dimwitted trio for their heroism, the celebration is short-lived as ruthless warlord Carlos Santana (Danny Trejo) pays a personal visit to the town with a plan to confront the fearless warriors who dared to challenge his iron-fist rule(n)</desc>

Initial efforts, including a stint as a children's entertainer and as a daredevil show at the local swimming pool, end in abject failure. But Rod, unbowed, goes for the big one: he aims to jump 15 school buses (one more than Knievel). Samberg is an alumnus of Saturday Night Live, and the show's wacky humour translates well to this picaresque comedy that never flags(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A middle-aged man finds a callow twentysomething usurping his professional life and worming his way into his family in this alternately funny and poignant comedy drama. Dan Foreman (Dennis Quaid) is a middle-aged man who has spent 20 years as the head of advertising sales for "Sports America," a leading athletics magazine. Dan is happily married to Ann (Marg Helgenberger) and has a college-age daughter, Alex (Scarlett Johansson), whom he dotes on, but Dan's comfortable life is given a major shake-up when a large multimedia firm buys the magazine. Seen as a bit long in the tooth to be truly competitive, Dan is demoted to second in command of advertising, and his position is handed over to Carter Duryea (Topher Grace), a 26-year-old who talks a good game about sales but has no practical experience in the field. Dan's wounded ego makes working with the arrogant Carter an uphill battle, but when he learns that Ann is expecting another baby, Dan is in no position to quit. Before long, Dan becomes aware of Carter's intense insecurities about his new job as the younger man reaches out to him for guidance, but this doesn't make Dan any less angry when Carter begins a romance with Alex after his marriage to Kimberly (Selma Blair) crashes and burns. In Good Company marked the solo directorial debut of Paul Weitz; he previously worked in collaboration with his brother Chris Weitz, who serves as producer on this film(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A 21-year-old aspiring hip-hop star from the Bronx is forced to put his career on hold when a gang of local thugs threatens his life and he is forced to seek refuge with his estranged father in Puerto Rico in this musical drama from producer Jennifer Lopez. Rob (Omarion Grandberry) is a New York City rapper who has gotten into hot water in his hometown, and now must flee to Puerto Rico. Upon arriving at his father's home in the Caribbean commonwealth, Rob immediately forms a bond with his half-brother, Javi, who introduces his distant sibling to the seductive sounds of Reggaeton. Rob and Javi's outwardly divergent musical tastes ultimately blend to form a unique new brand of hip-hop-flavored reggae, and they soon begin to gain a loyal following that ultimately leads them both back to New York City. Yet despite Rob's growing popularity in the music industry, the gangsters back in the Bronx are still hell-bent on revenge, and willing to gun him down at the first chance they get. Is Rob's newfound status as a high-profile musical innovator enough to make him bulletproof, or could it be that he's more vulnerable than ever now that he's up on-stage for all the world to see?(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">In Good Company</title>
    <desc lang="en">A middle-aged man finds a callow twentysomething usurping his professional life and worming his way into his family in this alternately funny and poignant comedy drama. Dan Foreman (Dennis Quaid) is a middle-aged man who has spent 20 years as the head of advertising sales for "Sports America," a leading athletics magazine. Dan is happily married to Ann (Marg Helgenberger) and has a college-age daughter, Alex (Scarlett Johansson), whom he dotes on, but Dan's comfortable life is given a major shake-up when a large multimedia firm buys the magazine. Seen as a bit long in the tooth to be truly competitive, Dan is demoted to second in command of advertising, and his position is handed over to Carter Duryea (Topher Grace), a 26-year-old who talks a good game about sales but has no practical experience in the field. Dan's wounded ego makes working with the arrogant Carter an uphill battle, but when he learns that Ann is expecting another baby, Dan is in no position to quit. Before long, Dan becomes aware of Carter's intense insecurities about his new job as the younger man reaches out to him for guidance, but this doesn't make Dan any less angry when Carter begins a romance with Alex after his marriage to Kimberly (Selma Blair) crashes and burns. In Good Company marked the solo directorial debut of Paul Weitz; he previously worked in collaboration with his brother Chris Weitz, who serves as producer on this film(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A 21-year-old aspiring hip-hop star from the Bronx is forced to put his career on hold when a gang of local thugs threatens his life and he is forced to seek refuge with his estranged father in Puerto Rico in this musical drama from producer Jennifer Lopez. Rob (Omarion Grandberry) is a New York City rapper who has gotten into hot water in his hometown, and now must flee to Puerto Rico. Upon arriving at his father's home in the Caribbean commonwealth, Rob immediately forms a bond with his half-brother, Javi, who introduces his distant sibling to the seductive sounds of Reggaeton. Rob and Javi's outwardly divergent musical tastes ultimately blend to form a unique new brand of hip-hop-flavored reggae, and they soon begin to gain a loyal following that ultimately leads them both back to New York City. Yet despite Rob's growing popularity in the music industry, the gangsters back in the Bronx are still hell-bent on revenge, and willing to gun him down at the first chance they get. Is Rob's newfound status as a high-profile musical innovator enough to make him bulletproof, or could it be that he's more vulnerable than ever now that he's up on-stage for all the world to see?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Rooney Mara stars as Emily Taylor; her husband Martin (Channing Tatum) is a young businessman who, as the film opens, is soon to be released from prison after serving a few years for financial fraud. Overcome with stress, the mentally fragile Emily performs a quasi-suicide attempt and is put in the care of Dr. Jonathan Banks (Jude Law), a workaholic psychiatrist who convinces Emily to see him once a week for therapy. Jonathan is intrigued enough by Emily's story to seek counsel from her former therapist, Dr. Victoria Siebert (Catherine Zeta-Jones). One night Emily commits a horrific act that she claims not to remember because she was taking the medication prescribed to her by Jonathan, leading to a very public legal battle that leads to Jonathan taking a major public blow to his reputation. This turn of events prompts the chastened doctor to look deeper into Emily's past. Directed by Steven Soderbergh from a script by his regular collaborator Scott Z. Burns(n)</desc>

Ince (Cary Elwes). But trouble is in the air, for among the guests is Charlie Chaplin (Eddie Izzard), who intends to steal Hearst's mistress, the actress Marion Davies (Kirsten Dunst), right from under his nose.

Based on a true incident once related to director Peter Bogdanovich by Orson Welles, this story was originally intended as part of Citizen Kane but was eventually omitted from the landmark film(n)</desc>

Though on paper their inventive scheme to save the factory may sound too outrageous to be true, stranger things have happened in the world of business, and if it doesn't break them, it may just transform them into the richest footwear manufacturers in all of England(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Cat's Meow</title>
    <desc lang="en">The year is 1924 and billionaire publisher William Randolph Hearst (Edward Hermann) has arranged a birthday cruise aboard his yacht, Oneida, for financially distressed film pioneer Thomas H. Ince (Cary Elwes). But trouble is in the air, for among the guests is Charlie Chaplin (Eddie Izzard), who intends to steal Hearst's mistress, the actress Marion Davies (Kirsten Dunst), right from under his nose. As the Oneida sails into the deep waters of the Pacific, the jealous Hearst struggles to suppress murderous thoughts amid unfettered merrymaking and the propositioning of gold diggers. When Ince discovers a love letter from Chaplin, he believes it is the key to a golden future in Hearst's production company, Cosmopolitan Pictures; but revealing the document leads to an unfathomable tragedy. Based on a true incident once related to director Peter Bogdanovich by Orson Welles, this story was originally intended as part of Citizen Kane but was eventually omitted from the landmark film(n)</desc>

Tehran, 1958: Nasser-Ali (Mathieu Amalric) has devoted his entire life to music. The violin bequeathed to him by his musical guru more cherished than his own wife and children, Nasser writes music capable of stirring the soul, and pours his whole heart into every note. When that instrument is broken beyond repair, the crestfallen musician retreats to his bed and invites death to take him. But the Grim Reaper refuses to comply, and instead Nassir finds himself inexplicably transported deep into his past before being thrust into the future to witness the fates of his neglected children firsthand.

    <title lang="en">Michael</title>
    <desc lang="en">Traditionally, angels are supposed to have snowy wings, spotless flowing robes and be bathed in heavenly light, but not Michael (John Travolta). With a hairy pot belly, long hair, a cigarette addiction, an insatiable sugar craving and filthy wings, the archangel Michael is anything but angelic looking. His unkempt appearance and the fact that he is found holed up in a ramshackle boarding house in a beat-up Iowa backwater, makes it even harder to believe that he is anything but a bum. Still when the publisher of the National Mirror, the country's top tabloid learns there may be an angel afoot, he sends three reporters out to cover the story. Slightly embittered writer Frank Quinlan (William Hurt) hopes the story will bust him out of his slump. Hapless photographer Huey (Robert Pastorelli) worries that one more botched job will cause publisher Vartan Malt (Bob Hoskins) to take away his one lucrative gig shooting celebrity wonder-dog Sparky. The enigmatic Dorothy (Andie MacDowell) is supposedly an expert on all things angelic. Together the disparate trio travel to Iowa and meet Pansy Millbank (Jean Stapleton) the aged owner of a run-down rooming house who tells them how Michael miraculously saved her from financial ruin. In return, she allows him to stay at her place. Naturally, the reporters want to meet this phenomenon, but they are ill-prepared at what groggily stumps down the stairs to greet them. From the stubble-faced, boxer-short wearing, smouldering mess before them, they learn that all high-ranking angels are allowed 26 Earthly vacations for all eternity. This is Michael's final vacation and he wants to have fun. The reporters only want to get as much publicity as they can from their ethereal visitor and so set off with him to Chicago. Along the way, they have many funny misadventures(n)</desc>
