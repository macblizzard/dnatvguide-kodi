    <desc lang="en">This edition of the programme focuses on large families who depend on the benefits system, including 64-year-old Peter Rolfe, whose children - by 15 different women - range in ages from three to 43, of which he is the sole carer for six. He has been fighting his council in the Isle of Wight for a much bigger house and is also at loggerheads with the benefits office for capping his weekly payment. West Midlands mother-of-eight Marie Buchanan has recently split from her partner and is looking for a larger home, while Ipswich couple the Fisks have been in dispute with their neighbours, who objected to two houses being knocked into one to accommodate them and their 13 children.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Marley &amp; Me</title>
    <desc lang="en">The Devil Wears Prada director David Frankel's light comedy-drama - based on a best-selling autobiography - stars Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston as a pair of married journalists who welcome a truly unruly dog into their lives. Relocating to Florida, newlyweds John and Jenny Grogan end up working for rival newspapers, and it's soon obvious that Jenny has landed the more high-profile job. But when she starts to become broody, one of John's colleagues suggests they see how they cope with a puppy before trying for a baby. John duly picks a cute yellow Labrador Retriever as a gift for his spouse. It's quickly clear their acquisition is something of a double-edged sword: he's an untrainably anarchic source of destruction; but he also gives John the material for a wry newspaper column, which greatly increases his standing.The film follows the trajectory of the Grogans' marriage, through good times and bad, and the stuff of everyday life, with the dog providing comic relief and the leads turning in convincing, heart-warming performances(n)</desc>

Dane has the technology to do it too, as just before he was fired from his government job he managed to launch a special satellite that can set off any of the world's nuclear missiles at Dane's command. Unbeknownst to the villain, the CIA-agent Casey Ryback--who had boarded the train with his adolescent niece to take her back to her father's funeral--is a far more formidable foe than Dane ever could have imagined.

Ultimately, the mother and daughter are able to relocate to an apartment, which, despite its excessively dilapidated interior, seems to be an adequate location for beginning a new life. Before long, however, what appears to be the spirit of a young girl begins to haunt them. No stranger to mental illness, the wary young woman brushes the visions aside as part of the inherent stress of making the transition from housewife to working, single mom. As time goes by and the apparent haunting does not subside, the apartment's new residents are forced to examine the history of its former tenants. Dark Water also features performances from John C. Reilly, Tim Roth, and Dougray Scott(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">25th Hour</title>
    <desc lang="en">A man has one day to put his life in order before a long stretch in prison in this drama directed by Spike Lee. Monty Brogan (Edward Norton) is a man who came from a working class family in New York. Monty's best friends Jacob (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and Slaughtery (Barry Pepper) went on to distinguished careers as, respectively, a high school teacher and a bonds trader, but Monty took a different path and began dealing drugs. While Monty's trade has made him plenty of money, it hasn't brought him much respect from his family and friends, and while Jacob and Slaughtery have stayed in touch, Monty's lifestyle has led them to keep their distance. One night, Monty is relaxing at home with his girlfriend Naturelle (Rosario Dawson) when the police show up; Monty is arrested, and after a trial he's sentenced to seven years in prison. On his last day of freedom before he goes to jail, Monty tries to make amends with his father (Brian Cox) and goes out on the town with Jacob and Slaughtery. With both of his friends facing emotional crises of their own, Monty finds himself wondering where his life took a wrong turn and if there's any way left to redeem himself. Along the way, Monty begins to suspect that Naturelle may have turned him in, and he has to deal with Kostya Novotny (Tony Siragusa), an ill-tempered drug supplier who has unfinished business with him. 25th Hour was scripted by David Benioff, who adapted the story from his novel of the same name(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Tropic Thunder</title>
    <desc lang="en">Ben Stiller's satirical look at Hollywood, Tropic Thunder concerns the production of an epic Vietnam War film that quickly derails thanks to the giant egos of everyone involved in the production. Stiller stars as Tugg Speedman, an action hero trying to segue out of that genre. Jack Black plays Jeff Portnoy, a drug-addicted fat comic also attempting to change his image by taking on such a serious film. They star alongside Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.), one of the world's most awarded actors, and a man who insists on immersing himself totally in a role. In this case, that means Lazarus has had his skin dyed in order to portray an African-American soldier. After their outrageous behavior lands the film's director, Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan), in very hot water with producer Les Grossman (Tom Cruise), Cockburn takes the advice of grizzled Vietnam vet Four Leaf Tayback (Nick Nolte); in order to gain control of his performers, Cockburn drops the actors off in the jungle, planning to film the movie guerrilla-style with hidden cameras. When the group stumbles upon a heroin production camp, the actors are unaware that they are in very real danger(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Zorba the Greek</title>
    <desc lang="en">If ever there was a role that Anthony Quinn was born to play, it was the lusty, life-affirming title character in Zorba the Greek. The scene is the isle of Crete, where English writer Alan Bates arrives in the hopes of realigning his own values and outlook on life. He is "adopted" by the flamboyant Zorba, who determines to educate Bates in the ways of the world-or, to be more precise, Zorba's world. Along the way, Bates is introduced to widow Irene Papas, the unrequited love object of everyone on the island, who comes to a tragic end when she is accused of adultery. The writer is also a spectator to the equally benighted romance between Zorba and venerable courtesan Lila Kedrova. Other disasters follow, but Zorba is able to convince Bates that failure is an inescapable part of life, and that only by constantly tasting defeat can one truly enjoy life's victories. Based on the novel by Nikos Kazantzakis, Zorba the Greek earned Oscars for actress Lila Kedrova, cinematographer Walter Lassally and art director Vassilis Fotopoulos(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Malcolm X</title>
    <desc lang="en">Writer-director Spike Lee's epic portrayal of the life and times of the slain civil rights leader Malcolm X begins with the cross-cut imagery of the police beating of black motorist Rodney King juxtaposed with an American flag burning into the shape of the letter X. When the film's narrative begins moments later, it jumps back to World War II-era Boston, where Malcolm Little (Denzel Washington) is making his living as a hustler. The son of a Baptist preacher who was murdered by the Ku Klux Klan, Little was raised by foster parents after his mother was deemed clinically insane; as an adult, he turned to a life of crime, which leads to his imprisonment on burglary charges. In jail, Little receives epiphany in the form of an introduction to Islam; he is especially taken with the lessons of Elijah Mohammed, who comes to him in a vision. Adopting the name 'Malcolm X' as a rejection of the 'Little' surname (given his family by white slave owners), he meets the real Elijah Mohammed (Al Freeman, Jr.) upon exiting prison, and begins work as a spokesman for the Nation of Islam. Marriage to a Muslim nurse named Betty Shabazz (Angela Bassett) follows, after which X spearheads a well-attended march on a Harlem hospital housing a Muslim recovering from an episode of police brutality. The march's success helps elevate X to the position of Islam's national spokesperson. There is dissension in the ranks, however, and soon X is targeted for assassination by other Nation leaders; even Elijah Mohammed fears Malcolm's growing influence. After getting wind of the murder plot, X leaves the Nation of Islam, embarking on a pilgrimage to Mecca that proves revelatory; renouncing his separatist beliefs, his oratories begin embracing all races and cultures. During a 1965 speech, Malcolm X is shot and killed, reportedly by Nation of Islam members(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Zorba the Greek</title>
    <desc lang="en">If ever there was a role that Anthony Quinn was born to play, it was the lusty, life-affirming title character in Zorba the Greek. The scene is the isle of Crete, where English writer Alan Bates arrives in the hopes of realigning his own values and outlook on life. He is "adopted" by the flamboyant Zorba, who determines to educate Bates in the ways of the world-or, to be more precise, Zorba's world. Along the way, Bates is introduced to widow Irene Papas, the unrequited love object of everyone on the island, who comes to a tragic end when she is accused of adultery. The writer is also a spectator to the equally benighted romance between Zorba and venerable courtesan Lila Kedrova. Other disasters follow, but Zorba is able to convince Bates that failure is an inescapable part of life, and that only by constantly tasting defeat can one truly enjoy life's victories. Based on the novel by Nikos Kazantzakis, Zorba the Greek earned Oscars for actress Lila Kedrova, cinematographer Walter Lassally and art director Vassilis Fotopoulos(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Malcolm X</title>
    <desc lang="en">Writer-director Spike Lee's epic portrayal of the life and times of the slain civil rights leader Malcolm X begins with the cross-cut imagery of the police beating of black motorist Rodney King juxtaposed with an American flag burning into the shape of the letter X. When the film's narrative begins moments later, it jumps back to World War II-era Boston, where Malcolm Little (Denzel Washington) is making his living as a hustler. The son of a Baptist preacher who was murdered by the Ku Klux Klan, Little was raised by foster parents after his mother was deemed clinically insane; as an adult, he turned to a life of crime, which leads to his imprisonment on burglary charges. In jail, Little receives epiphany in the form of an introduction to Islam; he is especially taken with the lessons of Elijah Mohammed, who comes to him in a vision. Adopting the name 'Malcolm X' as a rejection of the 'Little' surname (given his family by white slave owners), he meets the real Elijah Mohammed (Al Freeman, Jr.) upon exiting prison, and begins work as a spokesman for the Nation of Islam. Marriage to a Muslim nurse named Betty Shabazz (Angela Bassett) follows, after which X spearheads a well-attended march on a Harlem hospital housing a Muslim recovering from an episode of police brutality. The march's success helps elevate X to the position of Islam's national spokesperson. There is dissension in the ranks, however, and soon X is targeted for assassination by other Nation leaders; even Elijah Mohammed fears Malcolm's growing influence. After getting wind of the murder plot, X leaves the Nation of Islam, embarking on a pilgrimage to Mecca that proves revelatory; renouncing his separatist beliefs, his oratories begin embracing all races and cultures. During a 1965 speech, Malcolm X is shot and killed, reportedly by Nation of Islam members(n)</desc>

Citing a Texas man as evidence, the A&amp;E program documents the hidden occurrences of unfair convictions. In 1980, a young high school student was murdered in the small town of Conroe, TX. The first and only suspect was the school janitor Clarence Brandley. Despite having different hair and blood types from those found on the victim, Brandley was convicted of murder and sentenced to death by an all-white jury. His saving grace was an outspoken community and legal team dedicated to his release. Nine years later, Brandley secured his freedom. But what happens to a man who endures two stays of execution and almost a decade of false imprisonment? Brandley himself talks about losing a part of himself that can never be reclaimed. A&amp;E discusses the possible reasons behind Brandley's conviction and the fate of a corrupt police force(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Big Time. Despite her renewed commitment to her relationship with Aidan (John Corbett), Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) finds her resolve thrown into serious peril when Big (Chris Noth), possibly the world's worst ex-boyfriend, shows up at her doorstep and confesses that although he is married to Natasha, he can't stop thinking about Carrie. Another relationship is dragged into an early grave when Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) realizes she's tired of Steve's (David Eigenberg) childish, slothful tendencies and decides to break up with him. However, things are looking up for the relentlessly altar-minded Charlotte (Kristin Davis), whose burgeoning relationship with Trey (Kyle MacLachlan) is looking so promising that she decides to resist having sex for awhile in the hope that she can somehow be "re-virginized." Far from wanting to be re-virginized, Samantha (Kim Cattrall), who is worried that she may be menopausal, experiences a joyous rebirth of sorts when, while having sex with her latest conquest (Robert Lupone), she unexpectedly catches a wave on the crimson tide(n)</desc>

During a party Samantha (Kim Cattrall) throws at her new apartment, Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker), tormented by guilt over her fling with Big (Chris Noth), confesses her indiscretion to Samantha. Wondering if she's trying to have it all by dating Aidan (John Corbett) -- who is committed and trustworthy -- and sleeping with the unpredictable and titillating Big, Carrie is forced to lie to the former, who discovers she's started smoking again. Carrie tells Aidan she'll quit, meaning cheating as much as smoking, and when Big informs her that he's leaving Natasha, Carrie tells him to reconsider. Samantha, meanwhile, learns some hard facts when she comes down with the flu and none of her men will take care of her, while Charlotte (Kristin Davis) does some hard bargaining with Trey's mother, Bunny (Frances Sternhagen), and ends up with a cushy pre-nup agreement. Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), for her part, takes some lessons in phone sex from George, the out-of-towner she's dating, but becomes an unwilling pupil when she learns that George (Josh Hamilton) has been enjoying fiber-optic bliss with other women(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Apeman - Spaceman.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Professor Brian Cox examines how it was that in a universe made of stars, rocks and endless space, a conscious civilisation was born. His latest adventure takes him from a submerged space station in Star City on the outskirts of Moscow, to Ethiopia, high above in the great Rift Valley, where he encounters the geladas, mankind's distant ancestors. Despite once being Africa's most successful primate, a species which at one time roamed across the entire continent, these days they are found in one just place in the remote Ethiopian Highlands. Cox investigates why these ancestors retreated, yet modern mankind has expanded across the planet.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Life on the Fast Lane</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Life on the Fast Lane. Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) has a reputation for not being very good at picking out gifts for his wife Marge (voice of Julie Kavner), as evidenced by such past birthday presents as a tackle box and a Connie Chung calendar, but he hits a new low when Marge finds she's the recipient of a new bowling ball -- which has been drilled to fit Homer's hand and even has his name engraved on it. Marge is furious that Homer used her birthday as an excuse to get himself a gift, and while she doesn't bowl, she decides to learn just out of spite. Marge's early attempts to teach herself the game are disastrous, but she soon attracts the attention of Jacques (voice of Albert Brooks), a local professional bowler who has a French accent and a way with the ladies. Marge is more than flattered by the attention she's receiving from Jacques (who, just because he likes her, cuts his lesson fee from $50 to $25), and she begins spending more and more time with him. But when Jacques asks her to spend the afternoon at his apartment, she wonders if she ought to leave her marriage behind. Homer, Lisa (voice of Yeardley Smith), and Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright) all suspect that something more than a friendly game of ten pins is going on between Marge and Jacques, and all react with different degrees of dread. "Life on the Fast Lane" first aired on March 18, 1990(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Last Exit to Springfield. It's time for the workers at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant to negotiate a new contract with management, but their union representative has gone missing, so a handful of employees take it upon themselves to present their demands to owner C. Montgomery Burns (voice of Harry Shearer). One of those employees is Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta), who regrettably agrees to remove dental insurance from the employee benefit plan in the new contract in exchange for some free beer. Homer's decision comes back to haunt him when he finds out that his daughter Lisa (voice of Yeardley Smith) needs braces; Homer then persuades his fellow employees to vote down Burns' contract, and Homer is named the new union representative in the plant. Burns vows not to give in to the employee's demands, and finally Homer and his fellows go out on strike. In the meantime, Lisa still needs her braces, and the family is forced to settle on the cheapest they can find, which are even more conspicuous and unsightly than the average pair. "Last Exit to Springfield" was first aired on March 11, 1993(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Four bakers remain in the hunt for the title of Britain's best amateur baker, but they all need to raise their game when they tackle a trio of classic patisserie confections in the semi-final. A petits fours-making challenge provides an early test of nerves, before the quartet face the toughest technical task in the show's history - creating a fraisier, a sponge cake filled with mousse and strawberries. As tempers rise and confidence falters, the contestants have one last chance to impress judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry by baking a showstopping choux gateau - before discovering who has earned a place in the 2012 final.

When Liv Lerner and Emma Allan were girls they both attended such an impressive wedding at New York's landmark Plaza Hotel that they swore that, when the time came, they too would celebrate their nuptials there. Now, 20 years later, and after saying 'yes' to their respective fiancés, they've instructed their wedding planner to book the ceremony of their dreams. But, a clerical error results in both being given the same slot - and neither is willing to concede. Instead, their friendship is jettisoned as they resort to underhand tactics in a bid to sabotage each other and fulfil their fantasies..(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">300</title>
    <desc lang="en">Sin City author Frank Miller's sweeping take on the historic Battle of Thermopylae comes to the screen courtesy of Dawn of the Dead director Zack Snyder. Gerard Butler stars as Spartan King Leonidas and Lena Headey plays Queen Gorgo. The massive army of the Persian Empire is sweeping across the globe, crushing every force that dares stand in its path. When a Persian envoy arrives in Sparta offering King Leonidas power over all of Greece if he will only bow to the will of the all powerful Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro), the strong-willed leader assembles a small army comprised of his empire's best fighters and marches off to battle. Though they have virtually no hope of defeating Xerxes' intimidating battalion, Leonidas' men soldier on, intent on letting it be known they will bow to no man but their king. Meanwhile, back in Sparta, the loyal Queen Gorgo attempts to convince both the skeptical council and the devious Theron (Dominic West) to send more troops despite the fact that many view Leonidas' unsanctioned war march as a serious transgression. As Xerxes' fearsome "immortals" draw near, a few noble Greeks vow to assist the Spartans on the battlefield. When King Leonidas and his 300 Spartan warriors fell to the overwhelming Persian army at the Battle of Thermopylae, the fearless actions of the noble fighters inspired all of Greece to stand up against their Persian enemy and wage the battle that would ultimately give birth to the modern concept of democracy(n)</desc>

These indiscretions make Gwyn question the validity of the entire institution of marriage and doubt her own future. Director David Frankel, who also penned the screenplay, follows in the footsteps of Woody Allen in using introspective dialogue to detail the romantic troubles of a wealthy, neurotic Jewish family; practiced performances and a colorful use of Miami locations give the film its own personality(n)</desc>

With his understudy Noxeema Jackson (Wesley Snipes), Vida wins a New York drag stage contest and an all-expenses-paid trip to Hollywood. But when Miss Chi Chi Rodriguez (John Leguizamo) cries at having lost the contest, soft-hearted Vida cashes in the airline tickets so the three of them can take a car out West. The film becomes a strange sort of buddy road movie, with the three cross-dressers traveling across the American heartland in a shiny yellow Cadillac. First they tangle with Sheriff Dollard (Chris Penn). He stops them for a minor traffic violation, puts the moves on Vida, and Vida knocks him out, so they flee. Later, they are stranded by car problems in a small town in Nebraska. Renting a room in a hotel, they put some life into the town and its annual strawberry festival. They provide a mousy local woman, Carol Ann (Stockard Channing), with new role models of assertiveness. They also insist on chivalrous treatment from the local good old boys and give lessons on courting to a teenage girl. This film was released on the heels of the more outrageous Australian film The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, which featured Terence Stamp as a drag queen(n)</desc>

With a rate of 169 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants last year - an average of more than three people each day - Sula has the dubious distinction of being the most dangerous city on the planet outside of a war zone.

But it's an arduous journey and not for the faint-hearted. Even if passengers avoid falling off the roof of the train to their deaths, they face being robbed by bandits, raped, murdered or kidnapped and sold into slavery.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Sydney Wells (Jessica Alba) has been given the gift of sight, but it comes with a horrifying price in the English-language remake of Danny and Oxide Pang's The Eye. The double corneal transplant was to open up a new world for Sydney, a concert violinist whose blindness has plagued her since childhood. With the help of Dr. Paul Faulkner (Alessandro Nivola) and sister Helen (Parker Posey), Sydney's operation and recovery seemed to be on the road to success -- until horrific images start to tear their way into her newfound vision. What's worse is that these episodes appear to foreshadow future deadly events, leading Sydney on a mission to track down the person whose eyes she has inherited and discover what kind of mystery from beyond the grave lies before her. The film is directed by David Moreau and Xavier Palud, the duo behind the acclaimed 2006 French terror flick Them, and is produced by Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner under their Cruise/Wagner production banner(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Cinderella Man</title>
    <desc lang="en">The true story of an athlete who achieved his greatest success against the most daunting odds of his life is brought to the screen in this historical drama. In the 1920s, James Braddock (Russell Crowe) from Bergen, NJ, was a promising contender in professional boxing; he had strength, spirit, and tenacity, but the combination of a serious hand injury and a 1929 defeat in a bout with light heavyweight champ Tommy Loughran sent his career into a serious tailspin. As Braddock's career in the ring dried up, the Great Depression put a stake through the heart of America's economy, and Braddock found himself working at the New York docks for pitiful wages as he tried to support his wife, Mae (Renée Zellweger), and three children. Desperate for money, Braddock turned to his former trainer and manager Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti), who was unexpectedly able to scare up a bout for him, battling John Griffin at Madison Square Garden. While conventional wisdom had it that Braddock was too old, out of shape, and out of practice to have any chance of winning, he defeated Griffin, and continued beating his opponents with a powerful left hook that had been intensified by years of punishing dock work. In a nation desperate for good news, Braddock's surprising comeback became a tonic to struggling workers and unemployed people, and all eyes were on Braddock when in 1935 he took on powerful heavyweight champion Max Baer (Craig Bierko) in what was both literally and figuratively the fight of his life(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Bernie</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Richard Linklater teams with writer Skip Hollandsworth for this darkly comic docudrama detailing the unusual friendship between a likable Texas mortician and a wealthy but reviled widow, and the shocking crime that followed. Inspired by Hollandsworth's 1998 Texas Monthly article that first caught the attention of Linklater, Bernie takes place in Carthage, TX, where effeminate mortician Bernie Tiede (Jack Black) enjoys a reputation as a friendly and upstanding member of the community. Marjorie Nugent (Shirley MacLaine), on the other hand, couldn't hold a lower position on the local social scale. Repressed and bitter, nasty Marjorie has isolated herself from her neighbors, and as a result has been essentially shunned in her small town. The moment Bernie shows Marjorie a shred of kindness, she clings to him tightly and refuses to let go. Meanwhile, as Marjorie becomes Bernie's sugar mama and the pair becomes inseparable, the local rumor mill begins to churn. Eventually, her intense jealousy becomes too much for Bernie to take. When the caustic widow's body is discovered stuffed in her own freezer, local District Attorney Buck Davidson (Matthew McConaughey) vows that justice will be served, but he finds it difficult to build a convincing case against Bernie as the locals rally to his defense(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Eye</title>
    <desc lang="en">Sydney Wells (Jessica Alba) has been given the gift of sight, but it comes with a horrifying price in the English-language remake of Danny and Oxide Pang's The Eye. The double corneal transplant was to open up a new world for Sydney, a concert violinist whose blindness has plagued her since childhood. With the help of Dr. Paul Faulkner (Alessandro Nivola) and sister Helen (Parker Posey), Sydney's operation and recovery seemed to be on the road to success -- until horrific images start to tear their way into her newfound vision. What's worse is that these episodes appear to foreshadow future deadly events, leading Sydney on a mission to track down the person whose eyes she has inherited and discover what kind of mystery from beyond the grave lies before her. The film is directed by David Moreau and Xavier Palud, the duo behind the acclaimed 2006 French terror flick Them, and is produced by Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner under their Cruise/Wagner production banner(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Cinderella Man</title>
    <desc lang="en">The true story of an athlete who achieved his greatest success against the most daunting odds of his life is brought to the screen in this historical drama. In the 1920s, James Braddock (Russell Crowe) from Bergen, NJ, was a promising contender in professional boxing; he had strength, spirit, and tenacity, but the combination of a serious hand injury and a 1929 defeat in a bout with light heavyweight champ Tommy Loughran sent his career into a serious tailspin. As Braddock's career in the ring dried up, the Great Depression put a stake through the heart of America's economy, and Braddock found himself working at the New York docks for pitiful wages as he tried to support his wife, Mae (Renée Zellweger), and three children. Desperate for money, Braddock turned to his former trainer and manager Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti), who was unexpectedly able to scare up a bout for him, battling John Griffin at Madison Square Garden. While conventional wisdom had it that Braddock was too old, out of shape, and out of practice to have any chance of winning, he defeated Griffin, and continued beating his opponents with a powerful left hook that had been intensified by years of punishing dock work. In a nation desperate for good news, Braddock's surprising comeback became a tonic to struggling workers and unemployed people, and all eyes were on Braddock when in 1935 he took on powerful heavyweight champion Max Baer (Craig Bierko) in what was both literally and figuratively the fight of his life(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Bernie</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Richard Linklater teams with writer Skip Hollandsworth for this darkly comic docudrama detailing the unusual friendship between a likable Texas mortician and a wealthy but reviled widow, and the shocking crime that followed. Inspired by Hollandsworth's 1998 Texas Monthly article that first caught the attention of Linklater, Bernie takes place in Carthage, TX, where effeminate mortician Bernie Tiede (Jack Black) enjoys a reputation as a friendly and upstanding member of the community. Marjorie Nugent (Shirley MacLaine), on the other hand, couldn't hold a lower position on the local social scale. Repressed and bitter, nasty Marjorie has isolated herself from her neighbors, and as a result has been essentially shunned in her small town. The moment Bernie shows Marjorie a shred of kindness, she clings to him tightly and refuses to let go. Meanwhile, as Marjorie becomes Bernie's sugar mama and the pair becomes inseparable, the local rumor mill begins to churn. Eventually, her intense jealousy becomes too much for Bernie to take. When the caustic widow's body is discovered stuffed in her own freezer, local District Attorney Buck Davidson (Matthew McConaughey) vows that justice will be served, but he finds it difficult to build a convincing case against Bernie as the locals rally to his defense(n)</desc>

Fifteen years ago, an elusive serial killer known as The Wolf claimed the lives of 15 young girls. Thanks to the work of Detectives Elliott Carbon (John Rhys-Davies) and Johnny Morgan ( Andrew Cymek), The Wolf was eventually captured, locked up, and placed in the care of Dr. Parker (William B. Davis). When the facility loses power and the lights go dark, however, The Wolf and the rest of the inmates seize the opportunity to reclaim their freedom. Now trapped in these winding corridors with a rampaging gang of maniacs, madmen, and murderers, Johnny and Dr. Parker must fight to survive the night, and ensure that no one escapes before order is restored(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Nigel Cole directs the feel-good comedy Calendar Girls, based on the true story of a group of working-class British housewives who became overnight celebrities by posing for a nude calendar in order to raise more than 500-thousand pounds for a new leukemia unit. The film follows the adventures of best friends Chris Harper (Helen Mirren) and Annie Clarke (Julie Walters), both members of the charitable Rylstone Women's Institute in North Yorkshire. After Annie's husband John (John Alderton) succumbs to leukemia, the friends are motivated to take some action. They convince the group to craft a tastefully nude calendar featuring the usual ladies' activities of gardening and baking, as photographed by the young amateur Lawrence (Philip Glenister). Despite the disapproval of the Institute's leader Marie (Geraldine James), the calendar quickly becomes a best-seller and leads the group to Hollywood. Ciaran Hinds appears as Chris' husband Rod Harper(n)</desc>

Now trapped in these winding corridors with a rampaging gang of maniacs, madmen, and murderers, Johnny and Dr. Parker must fight to survive the night, and ensure that no one escapes before order is restored(n)</desc>

In contrast to the dull, by-rote announcers that have preceded him, Cronauer is a bundle of dynamite, heralding each broadcast with a loud "Goooooood morning, Vietnaaaaam," playing whatever records tickle his fancy (even those not officially sanctioned by his hidebound superiors), and indulging in wild flights of improvisational fancy. Cronauer's immediate superior Lt. Hauk (Bruno Kirby), whose own notions of humor are puerile and pathetic, jealously attempts to dethrone Vietnam's favorite rock jock. Fortunately, Cronauer's popularity is such that he enjoys the full protection of the higher-ups. But when Cronauer, after experiencing the horrors of war first-hand, insists upon telling his listeners the truth instead of the official government line, he is instantly replaced by the unfunny Hauk and must struggle to get back on the air(n)</desc>

Fred Flintstone (Mark Addy), a working-class caveman who earns his living at Mr. Slate's quarry, falls in love with wealthy heiress Wilma Slaghoople (Kristen Johnson). While many people think that Fred is out of his league, including Wilma's mother Pearl (Joan Collins) and her father Col. Slaghoople (Harvey Korman), he's determined to win her heart. And when his best friend Barney Rubble (Stephen Baldwin) decides to take his best girl Betty (Jane Krakowski) for a fun weekend in Rock Vegas, he invites Wilma to tag along. The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas recasts all the major roles from 1994's The Flintstones; Harvey Korman is the only actor to appear in both films, though in different roles (in the previous movie, he was the voice of the Dictabird)(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Two strong-willed women wield their influence on a shy teenaged boy in this coming-of-age comedy from the United Kingdom. Seventeen-year-old Ben (Rupert Grint) is the son of a soft-spoken vicar (Nicholas Farrell), but it's his mother, Laura (Laura Linney), who rules the household, and she has put Ben cheerfully under her thumb, keeping him busy with a variety of good-will errands for the church and numerous local charity causes. With summer vacation looming before him, Ben is looking forward to learning to drive, but Laura is more interested in spending time with one of the more charming members of the church staff than helping Ben learn how to operate the family automobile. Wanting to earn some pocket money, Ben starts looking for a part-time job and ends up working for Evie Walton (Julie Walters), an elderly and slightly eccentric actress who needs help keeping her garden in shape. Laura believes Evie isn't an especially good influence on her son, though Ben is happy to find someone who encourages his interest in poetry and the larger world (especially girls). One day, Evie announces that she needs to ride to Edinburgh, where she is supposed to give a reading as part of the city's massive music and arts festival. While Ben doesn't have his license, he volunteers to take the wheel, and soon he's confronted with various forms of decadence that his mother has frequently warned him to avoid. Driving Lessons received its North American premiere at the 2006 Tribeca Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">happythankyoumoreplease</title>
    <desc lang="en">Actor Josh Radnor makes his debut as a writer and director with this independent comedy drama in which a handful of people riding the gap between their late twenties and early thirties navigate the sometimes tricky path of adulthood in New York City. Sam (Radnor) is a struggling writer who has trouble with long-term relationships; one day while on the subway, he meets Rasheen (Michael Algieri), a young boy who has been abandoned by his parents. Sam takes the boy in, which gives him a preview of parenthood but also proves to be more complicated than he expected. Sam is infatuated with Mississippi (Kate Mara), a bartender with a dream of making it as a musician; tired of one-night stands, she agrees to move in with Sam for a few days to see how she feels about a "real" relationship, but Rasheen's presence makes things awkward. Another of Sam's sometime girlfriends is Annie (Malin Akerman), who suffers from a rare medical condition that prevents her from having any hair. Though she's beautiful, Annie's lack of hair has caused her to have a dire self-image and she jumps from one relationship to another with a handful of men, some of whom treat her poorly. And Mary Catherine (Zoe Kazan) and Charlie (Pablo Schreiber) are a couple whose relationship is teetering on the brink as he considers a lucrative job offer in Los Angeles while she refuses to budge. Happythankyoumoreplease received its world premiere at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival, where it received the audience award for Best Dramatic Feature(n)</desc>

Craig plays an unnamed gentleman drug dealer (well, all things are relative in his line of work) who, landed with an astonishingly lucrative job, spies his opportunity to retire relatively unscathed from the business. However, before he can do so, his boss Jimmy Price asks him to track down the missing daughter of another gangster, Eddie Temple, and as Temple's of an even nastier temperament than Price it's not a request he can easily refuse. And once he embarks on his task, complications begin to stack upon each other in much the manner of the confection that gives the film its title - though rather than some lovely sponge, cream and berries, this one consists of brutal henchmen, drug deals gone bad and violent bloodletting(n)</desc>

In 2009, O'Brien took over The Tonight Show from host Jay Leno; seven short months later, he was looking for a new job. Though his split from NBC was undoubtedly painful, O'Brien did his best to keep his spirits high and his fans laughing, even going so far as to embark on a cross-country comedy tour after being prohibited from appearing on television. In this film, we see not only the public image put forward by a beloved yet embattled television personality, but also the fierce determination of an entertainer to persevere after watching his dreams go up in flames(n)</desc>

Playing themselves, Yi and Cera embark on a scripted version of their own story. In the movie, Yi has agreed to be the subject of a documentary about her quest to discover if love really exists, since she's never experienced it. As part of her participation in the project, she has a film crew follow her around throughout every new development in her love life -- which gets complicated when she starts dating fellow comedian Cera. This portion of the film is all narrative, and was written into the script, but also as part of the documentary, Yi travels the country interviewing various people about their opinions and experiences with love, and these portions of the film are real -- the interviewees are not actors. Melding truth and fantasy, Paper Heart uses equal parts comedy and realism to resolve the ultimate question of whether love is fact or fiction(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Working Girl</title>
    <desc lang="en">Working Girl is a sparkling, entertaining comedy splendidly directed by Mike Nichols that takes a refreshing new slant on the familiar "ambitious secretary who makes good" story. Tess (Melanie Griffith) is a smart, resourceful woman who has trouble fitting in the corporate world. Smarter than her bosses and unwilling to trade sexual favors in order to advance, Tess is assigned to work for Katherine Parker (Sigourney Weaver). Tess quickly becomes indispensable to Katherine, and when Katherine breaks her leg in a skiing accident, Tess steps in and takes over. While doing some work for Katherine in her home, Tess discovers that Katherine has stolen an idea that Tess had shown her for a new proposal for an important client. Tess infuriated and discouraged by the betrayal pretends to be Katherine and, aided by Jack Trainer (Harrison Ford) who doesn't know of her deception, sells the idea to the client. When Katherine returns she discovers what Tess has done and has her fired. Tess manages to prove that the ideas were stolen from her by Katherine and also win the love of Jack who, unknown to Tess, was also Katherine's fiance.Melanie Griffith gives a standout comic performance as Tess, who manages to succeed without sleeping with the boss. Smart, sexy and shrewd, Melanie Griffith proves herself to be an excellent actress with perfect comedic timing. Harrison Ford and Sigourney Weaver are also excellent and bring depth and intelligence to roles which could easily have become stereotypes.Mike Nichols again proves himself to be an expert director of comedy, getting outstanding performances from all of his cast and giving the story tension, excitement and humor. Griffith, Nichols and Weaver were all nominated for Academy awards, as was Joan Cusackwho shines in a hilarious, stand-out performance as Tess's best friend. While criticized by some as a "feel-good" movieWorking Girl stands as a fine, optimistic, touching comedy which shows that a woman can succeed by using her brains(n)</desc>

Meanwhile, Bishop Christopher Senyonjo, a rare religious supporter of gay rights in Uganda, finds himself excommunicated from the church over his support of the LGBT community. Later, when David is brutally murdered just weeks after a notable legal victory for the community, a new generation of gay advocates begins to rise up, and challenge their oppressors(n)</desc>

Her homeland borders a country that is populated by humans and run by the cruel King Henry (Kenneth Cranham). One day, a farm boy named Stefan (Jackson Bews) traipses into the fairy's land and meets Maleficent, causing the two crazy teens to fall into forbidden love. Year later, Henry seeks to take over the magical land next to his kingdom, but is thwarted in battle by Maleficent. Eager for revenge, he offers his daughter's hand in marriage to whoever can stop the fairy, and the now-grown Stefan (played as an adult by Sharlto Copley) succeeds by betraying her and clipping her wings. In response, an infuriated Maleficent swears revenge on Stefan; she gets her chance when he becomes king himself and has his first child, a daughter named Aurora (Elle Fanning) -- as Sleeping Beauty fans will remember, Maleficent curses her to fall into a death-like sleep after pricking her finger on a spinning wheel on her 16th birthday. Stefan demands that all of the spinning wheels be collected, and orders his daughter to be secretly raised in the woods by three good-hearted but dim-witted fairies, who will return her to him the day after her 16th birthday. However, Maleficent refuses to stay away from Aurora and ends up developing maternal feelings for the girl, eventually inspiring her to try to undo the curse she placed upon the princess(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Family Guy Viewer Mail #1. The Griffins answer mail from the fans of Family Guy and also indulge in three quickie pop-culture spoof. "Li'l Griffins" recasts the main characters as the Little Rascals and comes to a climax in a haunted house. "No Bones About It" finds Peter at the mercy of a malevolent Genie who looks like Jackie Gleason. And in "Super Griffins", a radioactive spill transforms the Griffins into X-Cellent superheroes, leading to a showdown with Quahog mayor Adam West (who should know something about caped crusaders). With far too many "inside" jokes to catalogue here, it is probably best to simply reference the guest-voice appearances by Regis Philbin and Kelly Ripa--not to mention Police Academy regular Michael Winslow(n)</desc>
