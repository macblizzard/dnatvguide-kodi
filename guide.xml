    <title lang="en">Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl</title>
    <desc lang="en">Swashes don't come much more buckled than this - a rousing, rip-roaring romp on the Seven Seas, starring Johnny Depp in an extraordinary performance as Captain Jack Sparrow. Depp plays this notorious and legendary pirate with his tongue firmly in his cheek - Sparrow is eccentric, foppish and downright hilarious. He's also mad - because his beautiful ship, the Black Pearl, has been stolen. The thieves have captured the Governor's beautiful daughter too, so when the local swordsmith who loves her wants to mount a rescue mission, Sparrow doesn't take much persuading to join him. Based on the famous Disneyland theme park ride, fleshed out into an action-packed adventure, this film also has a brilliant script from the writers of Shrek. Stunning cinematography, superb sets, excellent effects and some peerless performances make this the perfect family film. It's a positive treasure trove of delights - it has skulduggery and swordfights, rogues and romance, comedy and compassion - and, of course, the obligatory treasure itself. An absolute gem!(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Wild About Animals</title>
    <desc lang="en">One of the first projects of syndicated TV producer Steve Rotfield, the weekly half-hour Wild About Animals was hosted by actress Mariette Hartley. The series cast its spotlight on rare animals, unique to specific regions of the United States. Regular weekly features included "K9 Cops and Animal Heroes," "Celebrity Owners," and "Animal Bloopers." First telecast in the fall of 1995, Wild About Animals was still flourishing at the end of the 20th century, by which time it was being shown in tandem with two other Rotfield efforts, The Lighter Side of Sports and Awesome Adventures, in most local markets(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Amityville Horror</title>
    <desc lang="en">One of the most celebrated horror films of the late '70s is given a new look in this remake, produced by blockbuster filmmaker Michael Bay. George and Kathy Lutz (Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George) are a young couple who are looking for a new home, and think they've found a dream house in Amityville, Long Island -- a large and beautiful home available at a bargain price. George thinks that there must be a catch, and learns that the house has a dark history -- a year before, a man living in the house murdered his family in their sleep, claiming he was commanded to commit the crime by demons. Shrugging off stories that the house is haunted, George and Kathy move in with their three kids, only to discover that something evil lurks within the house, and even Father McNamara (Philip Baker Hall), an expert on possession, is powerless to clear the dark spirits from the home. The Amityville Horror was based on the same book by Jay Anson that provided the basis for the 1979 film, which in turn documented an actual incident(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Director John Woo brings Hong Kong-style martial arts action to this comic book-flavored sequel that eschews the complicated plot and political maneuverings of its predecessor in favor of pure, adrenaline-charged thrills. Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt, an operative for the top-secret government agency IMF (Impossible Missions Force). Fellow agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) has gone rogue, stealing a sample of a deadly synthetic virus named Chimera that could rapidly wipe out the world's population. Ambrose's plan is to sell Chimera to the highest bidder in exchange for shares of stock in the winner's company. Summoned by the new IMF chief (Anthony Hopkins in an uncredited cameo role), Ethan is assigned to recruit the help of Ambrose's former lover Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton), a gorgeous woman who left Ambrose broken-hearted and who may be able to quickly regain his confidence. Once he meets and spends a night with Nyah, however, Ethan is smitten, and now must both capture Ambrose and keep Nyah alive as she infiltrates a nest of vipers. Sophisticated disguises, gun battles, and high-speed chases are the order of the day, very much in the James Bond mold. Mission: Impossible 2 is based on a story by Star Trek: The Next Generation writers Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga, with a script polish by Robert Towne(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">After three weeks of enthusiastic mimicry, the comedy-themed musical talent show draws to a close. Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins are on hand to present a live grand final, in which the six most popular celebrity performers from the previous three rounds battle it out. Back on March 4, first-round judges Katharine Ryan, Jo Brand and Frank Skinner were suitably impressed by Sara Pascoe's acrobatic turn as Chandelier singer Sia, while the public were wowed by Rickie Haywood and Melvin Odoom's 1990s-era Will Smith medley. These two acts became the first to grab a confirmed place in the final, and tonight, they perform alongside their rivals from successive weeks to determine which off-beat performance will ultimately be named the winner. Taking a seat on the panel this week are Rufus Hound, Katy Brand and Jason Manford, while Zara Larsson and Dua Lipa perform. Last in the series.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Veteran journalist Lynn Barber interviews sculptor and art teacher Phyllida Barlow, whose work has been selected to represent Britain at the 57th Venice International Biennale this year.

    <title lang="en">Revolution and Romance: Musical Masters of the 19th Century</title>
    <sub-title lang="en">Party Like It's 1899.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Suzy Klein's odyssey through the history of music in the 19th century concludes, turning the spotlight on later years, when technological revolutions seemed to make the world a smaller, more accessible place. Focusing on the Paris Exposition of 1889, a cultural showcase celebrating the centenary of the French Revoution, she reveals how composers such as Claude Debussy were exposed to the sounds of the East - immediately breaking Wagner's stranglehold of influence over Western music. She also examines the invention of saxophone, and makes her own recording on a vintage phonograph - an early precursor of vinyl records, cassette tapes and CDs. Last in the series.(n)</desc>

A devoted family man who married his high school sweetheart, Cal had a great house and a stable job when his wife, Emily (Julianne Moore), left him to be with another man. When Emily announces that she's filing for divorce, Cal finds himself awkwardly thrust into the dating scene and begins drinking his nights away at the local pub. Just when it's starting to look as if there's no hope for Cal, confirmed bachelor Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling) decides to add some much-needed excitement to the sulking, newly single father's life.

But just as Cal starts to turn heads, his adolescent son, Robbie, develops a big crush on his teenage babysitter, Jessica. Unfortunately for Robbie, Jessica only has eyes for Cal. Meanwhile, Cal can't help but feel like something substantial is missing from his life, and decides that the only way to set things straight is by listening to his heart(n)</desc>

Shrugging off stories that the house is haunted, George and Kathy move in with their three kids, only to discover that something evil lurks within the house, and even Father McNamara (Philip Baker Hall), an expert on possession, is powerless to clear the dark spirits from the home. The Amityville Horror was based on the same book by Jay Anson that provided the basis for the 1979 film, which in turn documented an actual incident(n)</desc>

George and Kathy Lutz (Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George) are a young couple who are looking for a new home, and think they've found a dream house in Amityville, Long Island -- a large and beautiful home available at a bargain price.

Shrugging off stories that the house is haunted, George and Kathy move in with their three kids, only to discover that something evil lurks within the house, and even Father McNamara (Philip Baker Hall), an expert on possession, is powerless to clear the dark spirits from the home. The Amityville Horror was based on the same book by Jay Anson that provided the basis for the 1979 film, which in turn documented an actual incident(n)</desc>

But, he held onto the claim that Fahey was killed by someone else. Capano was convicted and sentenced to death(n)</desc>

Looking at examples including a tiger cub whose family is under threat, a vulnerable veined octopus and a pair of sibling cheetahs guarding against starvation, the veteran naturalist illustrates how they develop new skills and learn how to survive on their own.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Home.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The importance of homes to animals, not only as a place to live but as a shelter from the elements and a refuge from enemies. A pack of African hunting dogs have made their home on a vast plain in Zambia, but it's far from safe as they must battle hyenas and protect their young. Hermit crabs on a tropical island settle down in empty snail shells - and when a new property washes ashore, they all form a queue, then move up the housing chain until all the shells are taken. On the edge of the Sahara are chimpanzees, whose survival relies on knowing where to find water in the most extreme droughts. Here the elders lead a troop on a brutal trek to a dried-out riverbed to dig wells.(n)</desc>

Eventually, luck runs out when they are caught in a police sting; one boy is shot to death by the crooked Officer Roscoe (Saul Stein), who then warns Jason not to tell a soul; however, they continue stealing cars. Meanwhile, Jason beats up a neighborhood acquaintance on the playground for a slight to his sister and finds himself the target of the boy's murder attempts.

After taking advantage of a community "pool on wheels" that rolls into their neighborhood during a summertime heat wave, Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright) and Lisa (voice of Yeardley Smith) decide to badger Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) and Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) into getting a swimming pool. The new pool makes the Simpsons the most popular family in the neighborhood, but Bart doesn't get much of a chance to enjoy his new status; he soon breaks his leg while trying to dive into the pool from his tree house. For the most part confined to his room, Bart wiles away his time by spying on the neighbors with a telescope, and one night he sees Ned Flanders (voice of Harry Shearer) digging what looks like a grave in his back yard. Bart then overhears Ned saying "I'm a murderer!" and comes to the conclusion that Ned has snapped and killed his wife, Maude (voice of Maggie Roswell). Bart and Lisa soon start playing detective, determined to uncover the evidence of Ned's wrongdoing. "Bart of Darkness" was first aired on September 4, 1994(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Eight weeks ago, the distinctive husky tones of India Fisher marked the start of another series of MasterChef. Since then, 57 of the original 60 amateur cooks have fallen by the wayside, leaving tonight's trio battling it out to succeed last year's victor Natalie Coleman as champion. All that stands between them and the title are three courses of perfect grub, so they'll be pulling out all the stops to impress judges John Torode and Gregg Wallace with spicy starters, mouth-watering mains and delicious desserts.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Heston Blumenthal explores the history of the classic British pudding. He heads back to the early 1600s, when the way to make one was by stuffing the ingredients into an animal's intestine. The chef creates a rice pudding that looks like a hotdog, with a white chocolate mousse bun, pastry-fried onions, sweet soy sauce and saffron mustard, and makes a 17th-century pud involving a cow's udder. He also attempts a giant sponge pudding from the Victorian era and serves it to a specially invited group of teachers and dinner ladies.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Pies.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Heston Blumenthal delves into the history of iconic British dishes to find inspiration for a culinary salute, beginning with a three-course pie banquet. For his starter, he learns about the `surprise' pies of the 17th century and a dwarf boy who would jump out of one at a grand feast. Heston prepares a gala pie made up of beetroot and horseradish ice-cream in place of meat, with goat's cheese panna cotta, saffron and bacon, and the main course is a gothic affair inspired by Sweeney Todd. The chef also sets out to make the lightest ever mash with an attempt to change the molecular structure of a potato. The dinner is served to a select group of pie-makers 100ft in the air over the East End of London.(n)</desc>

He heads back to the early 1600s, when the way to make one was by stuffing the ingredients into an animal's intestine. The chef creates a rice pudding that looks like a hotdog, with a white chocolate mousse bun, pastry-fried onions, sweet soy sauce and saffron mustard, and makes a 17th-century pud involving a cow's udder. He also attempts a giant sponge pudding from the Victorian era and serves it to a specially invited group of teachers and dinner ladies.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Pies.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Heston Blumenthal delves into the history of iconic British dishes to find inspiration for a culinary salute, beginning with a three-course pie banquet. For his starter, he learns about the `surprise' pies of the 17th century and a dwarf boy who would jump out of one at a grand feast. Heston prepares a gala pie made up of beetroot and horseradish ice-cream in place of meat, with goat's cheese panna cotta, saffron and bacon, and the main course is a gothic affair inspired by Sweeney Todd. The chef also sets out to make the lightest ever mash with an attempt to change the molecular structure of a potato. The dinner is served to a select group of pie-makers 100ft in the air over the East End of London.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">My Big Fat Greek Wedding</title>
    <desc lang="en">One woman's rocky road to the altar gets played for laughs in this comedy, adapted from the one-woman off-Broadway show written by and starring Nia Vardalos. Toula (Vardalos) is a Greek-American woman who is in her early thirties and single, with no immediate prospects of changing that status any time soon. This bothers Toula a bit, but not half as much as it distresses her mother (Lainie Kazan) and father (Michael Constantine), who want to send her to Greece in hopes of finding a husband in the old country. Toula isn't interested in leaving the country to find a man, but since she works in the family business -- a Greek restaurant in Chicago called Dancing Zorba's -- she has to hear about it whether she likes it or not. One day, after seeing a handsome stranger in the restaurant and not having the courage to talk to him, Toula decides she needs a bit of self-improvement. Despite her dad's misgivings, Toula signs up for a night-school class studying computers, trades in her glasses for contact lenses, gets a different job at a travel agency, and spruces herself up with a new look and a new attitude. To her very pleasant surprise, she once again encounters the handsome stranger, who soon asks her out on a date. Schoolteacher Ian Miller (John Corbett) is seemingly perfect -- he's tall, handsome, smart, good-natured, and soon in love with Toula -- except for two little things: he's not Greek, and he's a vegetarian, both of which horrify Toula's family. When Ian pops the question (and Toula says yes), the bride-to-be has to negotiate a reasonably peaceful meeting between Ian's upper-class parents and her own working-class extended family. There's also the matter of the wedding, which Toula's mother is planning around the notion that quantity IS quality. My Big Fat Greek Wedding also features Ian Gomez (Vardalos' real-life husband), Louis Mandylor, Andrea Martin, and Joey Fatone (from the pop group *NSYNC). Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson helped produce the film through the auspices of their production company, Playtone(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">My Big Fat Greek Wedding</title>
    <desc lang="en">One woman's rocky road to the altar gets played for laughs in this comedy, adapted from the one-woman off-Broadway show written by and starring Nia Vardalos. Toula (Vardalos) is a Greek-American woman who is in her early thirties and single, with no immediate prospects of changing that status any time soon. This bothers Toula a bit, but not half as much as it distresses her mother (Lainie Kazan) and father (Michael Constantine), who want to send her to Greece in hopes of finding a husband in the old country. Toula isn't interested in leaving the country to find a man, but since she works in the family business -- a Greek restaurant in Chicago called Dancing Zorba's -- she has to hear about it whether she likes it or not. One day, after seeing a handsome stranger in the restaurant and not having the courage to talk to him, Toula decides she needs a bit of self-improvement. Despite her dad's misgivings, Toula signs up for a night-school class studying computers, trades in her glasses for contact lenses, gets a different job at a travel agency, and spruces herself up with a new look and a new attitude. To her very pleasant surprise, she once again encounters the handsome stranger, who soon asks her out on a date. Schoolteacher Ian Miller (John Corbett) is seemingly perfect -- he's tall, handsome, smart, good-natured, and soon in love with Toula -- except for two little things: he's not Greek, and he's a vegetarian, both of which horrify Toula's family. When Ian pops the question (and Toula says yes), the bride-to-be has to negotiate a reasonably peaceful meeting between Ian's upper-class parents and her own working-class extended family. There's also the matter of the wedding, which Toula's mother is planning around the notion that quantity IS quality. My Big Fat Greek Wedding also features Ian Gomez (Vardalos' real-life husband), Louis Mandylor, Andrea Martin, and Joey Fatone (from the pop group *NSYNC). Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson helped produce the film through the auspices of their production company, Playtone(n)</desc>

An unidentified Russian teen has been rushed to a London hospital after going into labor. Though midwife Anna Khitrova (Watts) does manage to deliver a healthy baby girl, the newborn's mother dies tragically during delivery. But the deceased mother's secrets did not die with her, because she has left behind a diary. Determined to ensure the newborn is placed with her rightful family, Anna attempts to read the diary and discovers a business card for a local restaurant therein. Upon visiting the restaurant Anna is greeted by kindly owner Semyon (Mueller-Stahl), who generously offers to translate it for her. But Semyon is not what he appears to be, and before long Anna begins to fear that the child could be in great danger. Semyon admits to Anna that the diary contains information about his son Kirill (Cassell) that could land the volatile offspring in jail despite the fact that Kirill is at heart a good person. As the truth begins to unfold and Anna begins to believe that Kirill and his driver Nikolai (Mortensen) - an ambitious driver seeking to ascent the ranks of the notorious Russian mafia - mean the baby harm, an underworld storm begins to brew that could consume all involved(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Fence</title>
    <desc lang="en">In October 2006, the United States government authorized the construction of a massive fence stretching seven hundred miles along the border separating the U.S. and Mexico. Proponents of the fence claimed that it would help prevent illegal immigration into the United States and foil drug smuggling. However, three years into the construction project, undocumented aliens are still streaming into America through communities divided by the fence, and drug traffic has not been significantly reduced. The fence also runs through a number of Mexican communities, dividing small towns and school campuses thanks to poor planning, and the construction has had a negative effect on the environment of previously unspoiled territories. The fence is ugly, impractical and ineffective -- so why is America still spending billions on dollars on completing a project that's a failure? Filmmaker Rory Kennedy examines the strange history and sometimes comical consequences of the border project in the documentary The Fence; produced for the premium cable network HBO, The Fence received its world premiere at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Voice UK</title>
    <desc lang="en">The sought-after contract with Polydor Records becomes ever more tangible a goal as the eight remaining would-be pop icons enter the semi-final. Having survived auditions, the battle rounds, the knockout stage and the quarter-finals, the contestants should be more than a little familiar with the pressures of a live performance. However, with a place in the grand final in the offing, the pressure has never been higher for the singers. As always, coaches Will.i.am, Tom Jones, Gavin Rossdale and Jennifer Hudson are on hand to deliver their verdicts on each performer's voice-work, and ultimately cut the number of hopeful stars by half, as only four competitors can progress through to the final. Emma Willis provides viewers with access to all the backstage drama and on-stage reactions as events unfold.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Voice UK</title>
    <desc lang="en">The sought-after contract with Polydor Records becomes ever more tangible a goal as the eight remaining would-be pop icons enter the semi-final. Having survived auditions, the battle rounds, the knockout stage and the quarter-finals, the contestants should be more than a little familiar with the pressures of a live performance. However, with a place in the grand final in the offing, the pressure has never been higher for the singers. As always, coaches Will.i.am, Tom Jones, Gavin Rossdale and Jennifer Hudson are on hand to deliver their verdicts on each performer's voice-work, and ultimately cut the number of hopeful stars by half, as only four competitors can progress through to the final. Emma Willis provides viewers with access to all the backstage drama and on-stage reactions as events unfold.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">England v Lithuania (Kick-off 5.00pm). Mark Pougatch presents coverage of the Group F clash between the countries at Wembley Stadium. Gareth Southgate's side currently top the qualifying table, but the manager will know his men need to maintain their good form if they are to remain in top spot, with Slovenia - who play Scotland later today - breathing down their necks in second place. The Lithuanians comes into this contest having suffered a 4-0 loss away to Slovakia in their most recent qualifier, but have also claimed a 1-1 draw away to Scotland earlier in the campaign, and could make things difficult for England if they attempt to stymie their attacking play. With commentary by Clive Tyldesley and Glenn Hoddle, and analysis by Ryan Giggs, Lee Dixon and Ian Wright.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Voice UK</title>
    <desc lang="en">The sought-after contract with Polydor Records becomes ever more tangible a goal as the eight remaining would-be pop icons enter the semi-final. Having survived auditions, the battle rounds, the knockout stage and the quarter-finals, the contestants should be more than a little familiar with the pressures of a live performance. However, with a place in the grand final in the offing, the pressure has never been higher for the singers. As always, coaches Will.i.am, Tom Jones, Gavin Rossdale and Jennifer Hudson are on hand to deliver their verdicts on each performer's voice-work, and ultimately cut the number of hopeful stars by half, as only four competitors can progress through to the final. Emma Willis provides viewers with access to all the backstage drama and on-stage reactions as events unfold.(n)</desc>

With unprecedented access inside prison walls, it discovers what it's like to live with the threat of the death chamber, as well as hearing from victims and their families, and the family of those on death row - some praying for execution, some hoping for a reprieve. Each episode focuses on a key aspect of the system - execution, trial and appeal. The final film of the series follows 25-year-old legal student Kelly Hickman as she attempts to save two of the young killers facing execution in America. Kelly volunteers at the University of Houston Death Penalty Clinic, a team of Texan students who help mount last-ditch legal appeals for killers on Death Row. The team are working on two 'crisis cases' - cases where all of the offenders' normal legal appeals have failed and they are now just weeks away from execution(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">A Bronx Tale</title>
    <desc lang="en">Robert De Niro makes his directorial debut with this expanded adaptation of Chazz Palminteri's one-character play. De Niro's role of Lorenzo Anello, an Italian-America bus driver, is secondary to the part of his son Calogero. The top dog in Calogero's Bronx neighborhood is flashy "wiseguy" Sonny. When the boy witnesses Sonny commit a murder, he honors the code of the streets and refuses to tell the cops. Sonny befriends him and introduces the impressionable youngster to the creature comforts that mob connections can bring. But though he idolizes Sonny, the boy loves and respects his decent, honest father. It takes a major tragedy for the 17-year-old boy (now played by Lillo Brancato) to decide his true course in life(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">A Bronx Tale</title>
    <desc lang="en">Robert De Niro makes his directorial debut with this expanded adaptation of Chazz Palminteri's one-character play. De Niro's role of Lorenzo Anello, an Italian-America bus driver, is secondary to the part of his son Calogero. The top dog in Calogero's Bronx neighborhood is flashy "wiseguy" Sonny. When the boy witnesses Sonny commit a murder, he honors the code of the streets and refuses to tell the cops. Sonny befriends him and introduces the impressionable youngster to the creature comforts that mob connections can bring. But though he idolizes Sonny, the boy loves and respects his decent, honest father. It takes a major tragedy for the 17-year-old boy (now played by Lillo Brancato) to decide his true course in life(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A drug dealer moves on to bigger crimes in an effort to settle a score with disastrous results in this drama inspired by actual events. Though barely out of his teens, Johnny Truelove (Emile Hirsch) has already built a lucrative career for himself selling drugs -- he has his own home, a luxury car, and posse of friends who do double duty as his crew, including Elvis (Shawn Hatosy), Frankie (Justin Timberlake), and Tiko (Fernando Vargas). While life at Johnny's house is usually a constant party interrupted by occasional dope deals, Johnny has lost all of his patience with Jake Mazursky (Ben Foster), a regular customer who has run up a large tab that he can't pay. Determined to clear Jake's account, Johnny and his boys plan to kidnap Jake and hold him for ransom, but when they happen upon his 15-year-old stepbrother, Zack (Anton Yelchin), they impulsively decide to take the youngster instead. Jake's father, Butch (David Thornton), and his stepmother, Olivia (Sharon Stone), are already furious with their junkie son when they learn about Zack's disappearance, and aren't sure what they should do. Meanwhile at Johnny's place, Frankie takes a liking to young Zack, who already admires his brother's high-flying lifestyle, and introduces the kid to the joys of grown-up partying, which he takes to with dangerous zeal. Also featuring Bruce Willis as Johnny's father, Alpha Dog was based on the real-life story of Jesse James Hollywood, who at the age of 21 became one of the youngest people to ever appear on the FBI's "Most Wanted" list(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Hurt Locker</title>
    <desc lang="en">Based on the personal wartime experiences of journalist Mark Boal (who adapted his experiences with a bomb squad into a fact-based, yet fictional story), director Kathryn Bigelow's Iraq War-set action thriller The Hurt Locker presents the conflict in the Middle East from the perspective of those who witnessed the fighting firsthand -- the soldiers. As an elite Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal team tactfully navigates the streets of present-day Iraq, they face the constant threat of death from incoming bombs and sharp-shooting snipers. In Baghdad, roadside bombs are a common danger. The Army is working to make the city a safer place for Americans and Iraqis, so when it comes to dismantling IEDs (improvised explosive devices) the Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) crew is always on their game. But protecting the public isn't easy when there's no room for error, and every second spent dismantling a bomb is another second spent flirting with death. Now, as three fearless bomb technicians take on the most dangerous job in Baghdad, it's only a matter of time before one of them gets sent to "the hurt locker." Jeremy Renner, Guy Pearce, and Ralph Fiennes star(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Descent</title>
    <desc lang="en">A group of close female friends on a yearly adventure vacation find themselves trapped and hunted in a series of caves by an unknown force that lurks in the shadows in The Descent, the second horror feature from Dog Soldiers writer/director Neil Marshall. After suffering a devastating car crash one year before, Sarah (Shauna Macdonald) is lured to the States with her friend Beth (Alex Reid) to a special spelunking trip by the fearless Juno (Natalie Mendoza), who abruptly fled from the U.K. after Sarah's accident. Along with two old friends and a new acquaintance of Juno's, the group embark on a cave expedition that takes a turn for the worse after a rock fall leaves them stranded in an uncharted cave with no map and only a handful of supplies to last them the rest of the trip. As tensions arise in the group, they are faced with another danger -- one whose love of the dark is as strong as its lust for blood. Opening to rave reviews in the U.K. in July of 2005, the creature-feature went on to show at the Venice Film Festival and garnered the top prize for Euro feature at Sweden's Fantastic Film Festival. The Descent was picked up for future U.S. distribution by Lion's Gate, whose work was cut out for them considering the tame opening of the similarly-themed stateside production of The Cave in late-August of the same year(n)</desc>

De Niro's role of Lorenzo Anello, an Italian-America bus driver, is secondary to the part of his son Calogero. The top dog in Calogero's Bronx neighborhood is flashy "wiseguy" Sonny. When the boy witnesses Sonny commit a murder, he honors the code of the streets and refuses to tell the cops. Sonny befriends him and introduces the impressionable youngster to the creature comforts that mob connections can bring. But though he idolizes Sonny, the boy loves and respects his decent, honest father. It takes a major tragedy for the 17-year-old boy (now played by Lillo Brancato) to decide his true course in life(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Hurt Locker</title>
    <desc lang="en">Based on the personal wartime experiences of journalist Mark Boal (who adapted his experiences with a bomb squad into a fact-based, yet fictional story), director Kathryn Bigelow's Iraq War-set action thriller The Hurt Locker presents the conflict in the Middle East from the perspective of those who witnessed the fighting firsthand -- the soldiers. As an elite Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal team tactfully navigates the streets of present-day Iraq, they face the constant threat of death from incoming bombs and sharp-shooting snipers. In Baghdad, roadside bombs are a common danger. The Army is working to make the city a safer place for Americans and Iraqis, so when it comes to dismantling IEDs (improvised explosive devices) the Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) crew is always on their game. But protecting the public isn't easy when there's no room for error, and every second spent dismantling a bomb is another second spent flirting with death. Now, as three fearless bomb technicians take on the most dangerous job in Baghdad, it's only a matter of time before one of them gets sent to "the hurt locker." Jeremy Renner, Guy Pearce, and Ralph Fiennes star(n)</desc>

And when a Coastguard boat appears on the scene, things get even worse for her in director Bruce Beresford's revenge thriller. Libby is imprisoned for his murder on the circumstantial evidence - which also includes a massive death insurance payout - and her best friend, Angie, steps in to look after Libby's young son, Matty. But, speaking to Angie on the phone one day, Libby hears Matty say 'Hello Daddy... ' in the background and puts two and two together: she's been framed by her closest friends. Unfortunately for them, Libby discovers that once someone's been convicted of a crime, they can't be tried for it again. So she's got nothing to lose, and if she can get out of jail, she can make the pair pay the ultimate price for their treachery. Also starring Tommy Lee Jones(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Director Robert Luketic adapts Ben Mezrich's best-seller Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions to tell the true-life tale of six genius students who used their brains to beat considerable odds. Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) may be shy, but his wallflower reputation betrays his inner brilliance. As smart as Ben may be, however, if he can't pay his tuition he'll be kicked out of M.I.T. Fortunately, the answer to all of Ben's problems is right there in the cards. Recruited to join a team of extremely gifted students who have used their mastery of numbers to beat the odds at blackjack, Ben procures a fake identity in order to join the casino scammers and their brilliant leader -- eccentric math professor and stats genius Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey) -- in some highly profitable weekend excursions to Las Vegas. Counting cards isn't illegal, and by using a complex series of signals, this team has cracked the code. Of course, it doesn't take long for Ben to become seduced by the glamorous Las Vegas lifestyle, and the attention afforded to him by his sexy teammate Jill Taylor (Kate Bosworth) finds him pushing his luck to the absolute limits. Laurence Fishburne stars as Cole Williams, the Sin City security chief who catches on to the group and makes it his mission to expose their lucrative blackjack scam(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Kristin Stewart and Dakota Fanning star in Floria Sigismondi's rock biopic, based on Cherie Curie's autobiographical account. It's the mid-1970s and Southern Californian teen Joan Larkin has changed her name to Joan Jett. Along with her new dark, edgy identity comes a nascent desire: to create an all-girl rock band. Joan and her aggressive manager Kim Fowley stumble across the perfect face for the band: the 15-year-old blonde bombshell Cherie Curie. The two girls become close, with Cherie's sweet melodies slickly harmonising with Joan's electrifying guitar solos to great effect. They name themselves The Runaways and, after recruiting a lead guitarist and a bass player, are soon signed to Mercury Records, plunging them into the deep end of 70s rock excess. The success of their first album is massive. But, after a concert in Japan, the rest of the band discover magazines that feature only pictures of Cherie inside them - and are furious that they've been left out. Cherie begins to crumble under the pressures of being the face of the band, and starts to find solace in alcohol and drugs. As the band's stability disintegrates, can the girls rediscover the fun, runaway rock and roll lifestyle they sought?(n)</desc>

Also invited are the Therrians' neighbours Ryan and Monica Rose (Denis O'Hare and Mina Badie) who have nothing in common with the gathering of once bright young things.

He decides to reopen a community hall with the help of the locals, but faces opposition from both the government and a crotchety priest, who suspect the hall is a hotbed for loose morals and communist activity. Director Ken Loach won the Palme d'Or for his earlier film The Wind That Shakes the Barley, which explored the Irish Civil War of the 1920s; Jimmy's Hall, set a decade later, examines the lingering fissures of that war via the microcosm of Gralton's divided community(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Runaways</title>
    <desc lang="en">Kristin Stewart and Dakota Fanning star in Floria Sigismondi's rock biopic, based on Cherie Curie's autobiographical account. It's the mid-1970s and Southern Californian teen Joan Larkin has changed her name to Joan Jett. Along with her new dark, edgy identity comes a nascent desire: to create an all-girl rock band. Joan and her aggressive manager Kim Fowley stumble across the perfect face for the band: the 15-year-old blonde bombshell Cherie Curie. The two girls become close, with Cherie's sweet melodies slickly harmonising with Joan's electrifying guitar solos to great effect. They name themselves The Runaways and, after recruiting a lead guitarist and a bass player, are soon signed to Mercury Records, plunging them into the deep end of 70s rock excess. The success of their first album is massive. But, after a concert in Japan, the rest of the band discover magazines that feature only pictures of Cherie inside them - and are furious that they've been left out. Cherie begins to crumble under the pressures of being the face of the band, and starts to find solace in alcohol and drugs. As the band's stability disintegrates, can the girls rediscover the fun, runaway rock and roll lifestyle they sought?(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">There's Something About Mary</title>
    <desc lang="en">The Farrelly Brothers set this romantic comedy in their home state of Rhode Island. In 1985, when teen-nerd Ted Stroehmann (Ben Stiller) challenges a high-schooler who's bullying retarded Warren Jenson (W. Earl Brown), his concern prompts Warren's sister, the dazzling and desirable Mary Jenson (Cameron Diaz) to choose Ted as her senior prom date, a fact Ted's pals find hard to believe. However, on prom night, Ted gets his penis caught in his zipper, so the much-desired date never happens. Living in Providence and waxing nostalgic 13 years later, Ted hires Pat Healy (Matt Dillon) to locate Mary, and the creepy private investigator finds her in Miami, where she lives with her tan-shriveled roommate Magda (Lin Shaye). After Pat develops a stalker-style fixation on the lovely, unattached Mary, he lies to Ted, telling him that she's now an overweight mother confined to a wheelchair. Employing professional eavesdropping equipment, Pat gathers a dossier on Mary's life and future plans, information that forms the basis for more lies when Pat begins dating her. Sure enough, Mary falls for Pat, although her friend Tucker (Lee Evans) is very suspicious of Pat's claim to be a Harvard-educated architect. Meanwhile, Ted learns the truth but continues to encounter offbeat obstacles as he accelerates to Miami in hopes of finding happiness with his true love. Former Modern Lovers singer Jonathan Richman vocalizes a narrative ballad of onscreen commentary in the Cat Ballou (1965) tradition. Most of the cast sings and frolics to Build Me Up, Buttercup by The Foundations during the closing credits(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A thirtysomething single mother whose boundless potential was squandered through a series of failed relationships and a misguided effort to help her younger sister succeed in life finds the fruits of her labors finally coming together in director Christine Jeffs' dark family comedy. Back in high school, the future looked pretty bright for Rose Lorkowski (Amy Adams); not only was she the cheerleading captain, but she was also dating the star quarterback. Flash forward a little over a decade, and Rose is working overtime in hopes of getting her son into a better school. Her sister, Norah (Emily Blunt), is still living at home with their father, Joe (Alan Arkin), a failed salesman whose penchant for jumping into get-rich-quick schemes has left the family without a financial net to fall back on. Rose may be down, but she certainly isn't out, and when she hatches a plan to launch a crime-scene cleanup business, the money starts rolling in. Sure, cleaning up murder scenes and suicide sites may not be the most glamorous job in the world, but death is a fairly profitable business, and as the phone keeps ringing, Rose and Norah finally begin to experience the closeness of sisterhood that has eluded them all these years while also providing their family with true security(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Postcards From The Edge is about a very real mother-daughter relationship set against the backdrop of a very surreal place - hollywood. The film follows Suzanne Vale (Merrill Streep), an actress who struggles to rebuild her life after a stint in a drug rehabilitation clinic following a near fatal overdose. Upon her release from rehab Suzanne is dismayed to learn that because of her history of drug use and the undependable track record that resulted, the only way she can be hired for a film she is anxious to do is if a "responsible party" agrees to house and supervise her for the duration of the movie's shooting schedule. For Suzanne this requires moving back into the Beverly Hills home of her mother, Doris Mann(n)</desc>

Durell (Ice Cube) and LeeJohn (Tracy Morgan) are two best friends with a special knack for petty crime. Upset at discovering that his ex-girlfriend is planning to move out of state with the couple's young son, Durell knows that the only way to keep his fractured family in close proximity to one another is to raise the 17,000 dollars needed to pay off her growing debt.

    <desc lang="en">Gabrielle Union, Morris Chestnut, Queen Latifah, and Terrence Howard star in a film concerning a young girl who implores a department-store Santa to find a new husband for her divorced mother for Christmas. Single mother of three Nancy (Union) has been putting the needs of her three children ahead of her own for as far back as she can remember, and lately her youngest daughter, Emily (Khail Bryant), has become acutely aware of her mother's palpable sadness. As Christmas draws near, Nancy takes her kids to the mall for a cheerful visit with jolly old Saint Nick. When it comes time for Emily's turn to sit on Santa's lap and make her Christmas wish, she selflessly remembers her mother's recent comment that a compliment from a man would be the best gift of all. Determined to make her mother happy again even if it means sacrificing her own wish, Emily relays the message to Santa (Chestnut), not realizing that the man beneath the beard is actually an office-supply salesman and ambitious singer/songwriter named Benjamin. Recognizing the daughter's love for her mother and sensing something truly special in Nancy, Benjamin cheerfully obliges the young girl, setting into motion a series of events that promise to make this the most memorable holiday in quite some time.

    <title lang="en">Red</title>
    <desc lang="en">Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich and Brian Cox star in this comedy action-thriller from director Robert Schwentke. Frank Moses quickly becomes all too familiar with the acronym RED - Retired, Extremely Dangerous - when his former CIA bosses send a crack squad to kill their best-ever hitman. But the extremely dangerous retiree proves more than a match for them. Realising the Agency won't give up so easily, he goes on the run and abducts, for her own safety, Sarah Ross, the pension worker he's fallen in love with over the phone. Still in the dark as to exactly why his country wants him dead, Moses sets out to find out, gathering around him a group of equally ageing-but-deadly friends and associates. Can the wily old foxes evade, overcome and/ or outgun the crème de la crème of a new generation's black ops people, led by William Cooper, to discover the truth? What follows is a non-stop onslaught of witty one-liners, gunshots and explosions... and a masterclass in knowing acting(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A terminally ill Secret Service agent is coaxed out of retirement for one last job in exchange for an experimental drug that could save his life, and give him more time with his estranged family. For decades Ethan Runner (Kevin Costner) has kept his dangerous career a carefully guarded secret -- not even his wife and daughter know what he really does for a living. Shortly after receiving a grim medical diagnosis, Ethan decides to give up his dangerous career for one last shot at being a decent husband and father. Meanwhile, Ethan has been tasked with watching his daughter while his wife goes out of town for a few days. But when the agency offers Ethan a life-saving cure in exchange for capturing a notorious terrorist, he reluctantly accepts. Now, with his daughter's safety in his hands for the first time in a decade and the powerful drug's debilitating side effects taking hold, the hunt begins. Amber Heard, Hailee Steinfeld, and Connie Nielsen co-star(n)</desc>
