The instant he brandishes his wedding ring, the deal is all but cinched.

Meanwhile, New York cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) has come to L.A. to visit his estranged wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), who happens to be one of the hostages. Disregarding the orders of the authorities surrounding the building, McClane, who fears nothing (except heights), takes on the villains, armed with one handgun and plenty of chutzpah. Until Die Hard came along, Bruce Willis was merely that wisecracking guy on Moonlighting. After the film's profits started rolling in, Willis found himself one of the highest-paid and most sought-after leading men in Hollywood(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May embark on a race from London's Wembley Stadium to Milan's San Siro, the home of Italian football giants AC and Inter. A price restriction leads Jeremy to grab the keys to a Shelby Mustang GT500, which costs the equivalent of £35,000 in America and packs a supercharged punch of more than 650bhp. James and Richard pin their hopes on the pan-European rail network in a bid to secure the prize of tickets to a top-flight football match, with nothing but a long journey home awaiting the losers. On the test track, Jeremy puts Toyota's GT86 coupe through its paces, and its promise of entertaining rear-wheel-drive handling should put a smile on his face. Plus, singer-songwriter Amy Macdonald gets to grips with the Reasonably Priced Car.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The three petrolheads demonstrate their love of small cars with a trip to Ukraine. Jeremy Clarkson chooses a Volkswagen Up for the journey, while Richard Hammond takes a Ford Fiesta and James May opts for a Dacia Sandero. On their adventure, the trio absorb the history of the Crimean Peninsula, including a visit to an old submarine pen - but the carefree exploration looks likely to become a chore when Jeremy, Richard and James are challenged to a long drive north through the expansive country, during which they must combat serious boredom. And as if that wasn't arduous enough, a new task is set when they arrive in Kiev - a trip into the wasteland of Chernobyl. This edition also features a track test of the Danish Zenvo ST1 supercar and James Blunt returns for another drive in the Reasonably Priced Car.(n)</desc>

An exploration of the class and power dynamics in college sports through the interconnected journeys of one-time dynamic running back Maurice Clarett and former elite head coach Jim Tressel.

Tressel continued at Ohio State for another eight years before his career there also ended in scandal. Also available in HD(n)</desc>

The first episode looks at the influence of the Gulf Stream, with whales, giant turtles and jellyfish riding the huge current that becomes a migration super-highway and helps warm northern Europe, while fishermen battle for survival in mountainous seas as they try to exploit its natural fertility.(n)</desc>

The 125ft-long Argentinosaurus, which roamed South America 95 million years ago, was the creature that eclipsed all others - and remains the largest dinosaur ever discovered. For years, these colossal plant-eaters were considered immune to attack from any predator - until the discovery of new giant killer the mapusaurus, whose fate was inextricably linked to the Argentinosaurus.(n)</desc>

The first episode looks at the influence of the Gulf Stream, with whales, giant turtles and jellyfish riding the huge current that becomes a migration super-highway and helps warm northern Europe, while fishermen battle for survival in mountainous seas as they try to exploit its natural fertility.(n)</desc>

The case involved tracking down a hactivist collective known as Krampus, who were thought to have been responsible for an incident in which the internet crashed all over Washington, DC. McGee and Abby brought in three known cyber-terrorists for questioning, and discover evidence that links the trio to an attempted breach of the Congress email server and archive. However, when this line of inquiry reaches a dead-end, the team picks up a new lead that suggests an isolated hacker from Wisconsin may be responsible. This `lone wolf' scenario does not seem plausible to McGee, though, as he recalls a lesson his late dad taught him. Crime drama, starring Sean Murray.(n)</desc>

Looking to boost sales, Costington's Department Store invents a new holiday, Love Day, which prompts Springfield residents to buy one another gifts such as "Sir Loves-A-Lot, the bear who loves to love." However, all those boxes and wrapping paper mean plenty of trash, and Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta), typically late in taking the trash out to the curb, curses the sanitation workers when they don't pick up his rubbish. The angry garbage men refuse to pick up the Simpsons' trash until Homer apologizes, which he's highly reluctant to do. Eventually, Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) apologizes on her husband's behalf, which leads to an angry confrontation between Homer and Ray Patterson (voice of Steve Martin), Springfield's sanitation commissioner. Homer decides to put Patterson out of business by running for sanitation commissioner himself, and after making a number of ridiculous promises and slandering his opponent, Homer wins the office. However, Homer's ambitious plans cause him to blow through his annual sanitation budget in less than a month, and to cover up his mistakes, he starts accepting dangerous waste from other cities until Springfield's landfills are overflowing. First aired on April 26, 1998, "Trash of the Titans" also features a guest appearance from Bono, The Edge, Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen of the rock group U2 as themselves(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">MasterChef judge Gregg Wallace and greengrocer Chris Bavin set out to help the Scott-Dent family in Newport with their food shopping, showing them simple and effective ways to save money. Kate and Chris have three children under 10, they both work, and Kate hates cooking, so relies on freezer food, Gregg and Chris secretly watch them on a weekly shop to see where they are going wrong, and their mistakes include buying sliced and grated cheese, pre-prepared fruit and veg, and overpriced frozen food. The couple are shocked when they are told that they are spending twice the amount of an average family of five. Plus, Chris tries to allay Kate's fear of using food near its sell-by date, and investigates how safe our food labels really are, while dietician Lucy Jones investigates the nutritional differences between margarine and butter.(n)</desc>

Since then, 57 of the original 60 amateur cooks have fallen by the wayside, leaving tonight's trio battling it out to succeed last year's victor Natalie Coleman as champion. All that stands between them and the title are three courses of perfect grub, so they'll be pulling out all the stops to impress judges John Torode and Gregg Wallace with spicy starters, mouth-watering mains and delicious desserts.(n)</desc>

They buy so many crisps in a single shop that Gregg is left wondering what they actually eat for dinner. The family are vegetarian, so dietician Lucy Jones looks at the nutritional difference between beef mince and soya mince, and Gregg visits a factory to find out how meat substitute is made - but can he and Chris persuade the Sainis to change their ways?.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Selena</title>
    <desc lang="en">Selena was a 23-year old Tejana singer on the verge of an international breakthrough when she was shot by the president of her own fan club. Her death spawned an outpouring of grief not seen since the death of Elvis Presley. This upbeat and tuneful biopic, executive produced by her father, Abraham Quintanilla (portrayed in the film by Edward James Olmos), is a celebration of his daughter's life, chronicling her rise to fame. The film opens with Selena (Jennifer Lopez) performing at the Houston Astrodome before a sold-out audience. The story moves backwards and begins not with Selena, but with Abraham who in the early '60s had an unsuccessful doo-wop group in Texas. As a child, Selena (Rebecca Lee Meza) showed an exceptional talent for singing. Abraham exploited that and the talents of his other two children to form a band. Much of the film focuses on the fact that Selena, though born in Texas in a Mexican-American community, had to learn Spanish as a second language. Her father insisted that she sing in the language, but it was not easy for her. To maintain the story's celebratory air, it only lightly touches on Selena's relationship with her killer -- the actual shooting occurs off-screen. The after-effects of Selena's death are also only briefly presented(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Selena</title>
    <desc lang="en">Selena was a 23-year old Tejana singer on the verge of an international breakthrough when she was shot by the president of her own fan club. Her death spawned an outpouring of grief not seen since the death of Elvis Presley. This upbeat and tuneful biopic, executive produced by her father, Abraham Quintanilla (portrayed in the film by Edward James Olmos), is a celebration of his daughter's life, chronicling her rise to fame. The film opens with Selena (Jennifer Lopez) performing at the Houston Astrodome before a sold-out audience. The story moves backwards and begins not with Selena, but with Abraham who in the early '60s had an unsuccessful doo-wop group in Texas. As a child, Selena (Rebecca Lee Meza) showed an exceptional talent for singing. Abraham exploited that and the talents of his other two children to form a band. Much of the film focuses on the fact that Selena, though born in Texas in a Mexican-American community, had to learn Spanish as a second language. Her father insisted that she sing in the language, but it was not easy for her. To maintain the story's celebratory air, it only lightly touches on Selena's relationship with her killer -- the actual shooting occurs off-screen. The after-effects of Selena's death are also only briefly presented(n)</desc>

Astoundingly, David is not only alive, he hardly seems to have been touched. As David wonders what has happened to him and why he was able to walk away, he encounters a mysterious stranger, Elijah Prince (Samuel L. Jackson), who explains to David that there are a certain number of people who are "unbreakable" -- they have remarkable endurance and courage, a predisposition toward dangerous behavior, and feel invincible but also have strange premonitions of terrible events. Is David "unbreakable"? And if he is, what are the physical and psychological ramifications of this knowledge? Unbreakable also stars Robin Wright-Penn as Audrey, David's wife; the supporting cast includes Spencer Treat Clark and Joey Perillo(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Slumdog Millionaire</title>
    <desc lang="en">Accused of cheating and desperate to prove his innocence, an eighteen-year-old orphan from the slums of Mumbai reflects back on his tumultuous life while competing to win 20 million rupees on India's Who Wants to Be a Millionaire in Danny Boyle's inspirational drama. Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) may not have a penny to his name, but that could all change in a matter of hours. He's one question away from taking the top prize on India's most popular television game show, but as with everything else in Jamal's life, it isn't going to be easy. Arrested by police under suspicion of cheating, Jamal is interrogated by the authorities. The police simply can't believe that a common "slumdog" could possibly possess the knowledge to get this far in the game, and in order to convince them of how he gained such knowledge, Jamal begins reflecting back on his childhood. As young boys, Jamal and his older brother, Salim, lived in squalor, and lost their mother in a mob attack on Muslims. Subsequently forced to rely on their own wits to survive, the desperate siblings fell back on petty crime, eventually befriending adorable yet feisty young Latika as they sought out food and shelter on the unforgiving streets of Mumbai. Though life on the streets was never easy, Jamal's experiences ultimately instilled in him the knowledge he needed to answer the tough questions posed to him on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. And though Jamal makes a convincing case for himself, one question still remains: why would a young man with no apparent desire for wealth or fame be so determined to win big on a national game show? Of course, it won't be long until everyone finds out the answer to this burning question, because as Jamal sits down to find out whether he will be rich beyond his wildest dreams, 60 million viewers remain transfixed to their televisions eager to see if he'll correctly answer the final question(n)</desc>

Astoundingly, David is not only alive, he hardly seems to have been touched. As David wonders what has happened to him and why he was able to walk away, he encounters a mysterious stranger, Elijah Prince (Samuel L. Jackson), who explains to David that there are a certain number of people who are "unbreakable" -- they have remarkable endurance and courage, a predisposition toward dangerous behavior, and feel invincible but also have strange premonitions of terrible events. Is David "unbreakable"? And if he is, what are the physical and psychological ramifications of this knowledge? Unbreakable also stars Robin Wright-Penn as Audrey, David's wife; the supporting cast includes Spencer Treat Clark and Joey Perillo(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Slumdog Millionaire</title>
    <desc lang="en">Accused of cheating and desperate to prove his innocence, an eighteen-year-old orphan from the slums of Mumbai reflects back on his tumultuous life while competing to win 20 million rupees on India's Who Wants to Be a Millionaire in Danny Boyle's inspirational drama. Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) may not have a penny to his name, but that could all change in a matter of hours. He's one question away from taking the top prize on India's most popular television game show, but as with everything else in Jamal's life, it isn't going to be easy. Arrested by police under suspicion of cheating, Jamal is interrogated by the authorities. The police simply can't believe that a common "slumdog" could possibly possess the knowledge to get this far in the game, and in order to convince them of how he gained such knowledge, Jamal begins reflecting back on his childhood. As young boys, Jamal and his older brother, Salim, lived in squalor, and lost their mother in a mob attack on Muslims. Subsequently forced to rely on their own wits to survive, the desperate siblings fell back on petty crime, eventually befriending adorable yet feisty young Latika as they sought out food and shelter on the unforgiving streets of Mumbai. Though life on the streets was never easy, Jamal's experiences ultimately instilled in him the knowledge he needed to answer the tough questions posed to him on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. And though Jamal makes a convincing case for himself, one question still remains: why would a young man with no apparent desire for wealth or fame be so determined to win big on a national game show? Of course, it won't be long until everyone finds out the answer to this burning question, because as Jamal sits down to find out whether he will be rich beyond his wildest dreams, 60 million viewers remain transfixed to their televisions eager to see if he'll correctly answer the final question(n)</desc>

As the story begins, the two pensioners have become grudging pals, content to suspend their constant practical jokes as their children prepare to marry each other. They still enjoy taunting each other at their favorite fishing lake. The fireworks really begin when they learn that the gorgeous and plucky Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) and her Italian mother have bought their beloved bait shop and plan to turn it into an Italian restaurant. The two devious fellows, hating the idea that anything should change in Wabasha, Minnesota, team up to keep that restaurant from opening, but Maria is having none of that nonsense and stands her ground. In the face of such feistiness, it is small wonder that Goldman finds himself falling in love, but will he succeed in subduing the equally stubborn Maria? Will he and Gustafson manage to maintain their tentative détente?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Director/screenwriter David Gordon Green adapts Stewart O'Nan's popular novel to the screen in this feature, which tells the parallel tales of a teenager named Arthur (Michael Angarano) and his onetime babysitter Annie (Kate Beckinsale) -- whose turbulent relationship with her estranged husband, Glenn (Sam Rockwell), leads the small-town waitress down a troubled path. Arthur is a high-school student from a dysfunctional family, and does everything in his power to avoid hanging around the house while mom and dad quarrel. When he's not practicing his trombone and performing with the high-school marching band, Arthur can usually be found bussing tables at the local Chinese restaurant and flirting with older waitress Annie. Annie used to be Arthur's babysitter, and is currently struggling to separate from her former high-school sweetheart, Glenn. But being a single mother isn't easy, especially since the troubled Glenn wants nothing more than to clean up his act and reunite his family. Back at school, Arthur and pretty classmate Lila (Olivia Thirlby) have been bonding over their mutual love for all things geeky. Though the casual friendship shows promise of evolving into something more when Lila expresses her true feelings for Arthur, he can't help but becoming distracted by his chaotic family life: his father is moving out of the family home, and his mother is doing everything in her power to maintain some semblance of normalcy. Realizing that happiness is fleeting as his family becomes shattered and Annie experiences a series of distressing encounters with Glenn, Arthur gradually begins to fall for Lisa despite his growing cynicism concerning long-term relationships. Later, on a cold winter morning, Glenn and Annie's past catches up with them in a blinding flash, and the lives of everyone they know are suddenly and irrevocably changed(n)</desc>

At the end of the second film, the centuries-in-the-future world colonized by simians was destroyed, but apes Cornelius (Roddy McDowall) and Zira (Kim Hunter) were able to escape in the space vessel left behind by 20th century astronaut George Taylor (Charlton Heston). Cornelius and Zira pass through another time warp, finding themselves in the Earth of the 1970s. When they reveal their ability to speak, the apes are first treated as curiosities, then as threats when the government, believing the story that the Earth will eventually be inherited by monkeys, tries to prevent the birth of Zira's baby. They are ultimately given shelter by sympathetic circus owner Armando (Ricardo Montalban). This film was followed by the fourth "Apes" entry, 1972's Conquest of the Planet of the Apes(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The broadcaster travels to Bedford Hills Correctional Facility in New York State to meet Sheila Davalloo, who has been convicted for murdering Anna Lisa Raymundo. However, in a bizarre twist to the story, Sheila has not yet started her 50-year sentence. First she must finish the 25 years she was given for the attempted murder of her husband. Sheila has remained silent about the killing for 14 years, so Piers tries to get her to finally open up, while also looking into why she wanted both of her victims out of the way. Last in the series.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A team of highly motivated scientists led by National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence Enric Sala sets out on a treacherous journey to the Pitcairn Islands, a remote archipelago in the Pacific Ocean, to document the environment both in the sea and on land with hopes of turning this potentially pristine ocean environment into a protected marine reserve. For thirty days and thirty nights, hundreds of miles from anywhere, Sala's expedition will tackle the mysteries of the Pitcairns head on, hitting all four islands in the chain. Not much is known about the islands and each tells a unique story. Following in the same vein as his previous odysseys (and films), Enric Sala leads the charge on yet another groundbreaking expedition to document what healthy reefs should look like and explore what could be one of the last pristine ocean locations on earth. This is exploration at its most extreme and isolated. And in this remote corner of the planet, the stakes are high(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">MasterChef: The Professionals</title>
    <desc lang="en">In the last programme of knockout week, the second group of five chefs face two tough tests. First they work together to cook a three-course fine dining lunch for ex-England captain Mike Gatting and his guests at Lord's cricket ground. They have to build their menu around mackerel, rabbit, apples and pears - and teamwork will be key as they to plan, execute and transport their dishes to the table. They then return to the MasterChef kitchen to produce a showstopper dish in just 90 minutes - hoping it will be enough to book their place in the semi-finals. As ever, deciding their fates will be no-nonsense judges Marcus Wareing and Monica Galetti.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Walt Disney Pictures redefined computer animation with this technically accomplished fantasy of prehistoric life, combining live-action backgrounds with computer-generated animals. After a pterodactyl snatches a dinosaur's egg and accidentally drops it while flying away, the egg is rescued by a family of lemurs, who keep it warm until it hatches. They raise the baby dinosaur, named Aladar, as one of their own, and as he grows to adulthood, Aladar protects the primates that he has come to regard as his family. When a giant meteor appears in the sky, packs of dinosaurs have no idea what to make of the strange fiery light, but Aladar and the lemurs are convinced that they must escape to a safer place before the huge flaming stone destroys their home, leading Aladar to encounter his own kind for the first time. D.B. Sweeney provides the voice of Aladar; other actors in the voice cast include Joan Plowright, Julianna Margulies, Alfre Woodard, and Ossie Davis(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Walt Disney Pictures redefined computer animation with this technically accomplished fantasy of prehistoric life, combining live-action backgrounds with computer-generated animals. After a pterodactyl snatches a dinosaur's egg and accidentally drops it while flying away, the egg is rescued by a family of lemurs, who keep it warm until it hatches. They raise the baby dinosaur, named Aladar, as one of their own, and as he grows to adulthood, Aladar protects the primates that he has come to regard as his family. When a giant meteor appears in the sky, packs of dinosaurs have no idea what to make of the strange fiery light, but Aladar and the lemurs are convinced that they must escape to a safer place before the huge flaming stone destroys their home, leading Aladar to encounter his own kind for the first time. D.B. Sweeney provides the voice of Aladar; other actors in the voice cast include Joan Plowright, Julianna Margulies, Alfre Woodard, and Ossie Davis(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Writer/director Sophie Barthes crafts this metaphysical tragicomedy, which straddles the line between reality and fantasy, set in a world where souls are extracted from humans and traded as commodites. Paul Giamatti is an anxious New Yorker who finds the answer to his deep-rooted malaise after stumbling upon an article about a high-tech company that claims to have found a solution to human suffering. By deep-freezing souls, claims the company, they can give their customers a life free from fear, doubt, and worry. Eager to free himself from the emotional burden of angst, Giamatti eagerly enlists their services. Trouble arises, however, when Giamatti's soul is swiped by a soul-trafficking "mule" who in turn gives it to a no-talent Russian soap opera actress. Now, in order to get back the soul that is rightfully his, Giamatti must make the arduous trip to St. Petersburg, along the way discovering that the true key to happiness isn't the absence of pain, but the ability to experience the entire spectrum of emotion and cherish the things that really matter(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Zombie Honeymoon</title>
    <desc lang="en">A young bride says "until death do us part," but finds that doesn't necessarily put an end to her romance in this offbeat blend of horror, comedy, and romance. Danny (Graham Sibley) and Denise (Tracy Coogan) are a young couple who have just gotten married and head off to a beachside bungalow to celebrate their honeymoon. While enjoying a sunny afternoon on the beach, Danny and Denise's idyllic getaway takes a turn for the worse when a monster rises from the ocean and attacks Danny. The creature spews poison into Danny's mouth, and soon the new husband is dead. But Danny isn't gone for long -- he unexpectedly regains consciousness, but Denise soon learns that her new mate has become a flesh-eating zombie, and that the former vegetarian now has a taste for human beings. But Danny still has one link with the world of the living -- he loves Denise with all his heart, and struggles to keep his monstrous appetites under control for her sake, while Denise remains deeply in love with Danny, and tries to adjust to the strange and monstrous changes taking place in the man she married. Zombie Honeymoon was written and directed by Dave Gebroe, who was inspired to make the film by his sister, a horror film fan who lost her husband in a surfing accident not long after they were wed(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">happythankyoumoreplease</title>
    <desc lang="en">Actor Josh Radnor makes his debut as a writer and director with this independent comedy drama in which a handful of people riding the gap between their late twenties and early thirties navigate the sometimes tricky path of adulthood in New York City. Sam (Radnor) is a struggling writer who has trouble with long-term relationships; one day while on the subway, he meets Rasheen (Michael Algieri), a young boy who has been abandoned by his parents. Sam takes the boy in, which gives him a preview of parenthood but also proves to be more complicated than he expected. Sam is infatuated with Mississippi (Kate Mara), a bartender with a dream of making it as a musician; tired of one-night stands, she agrees to move in with Sam for a few days to see how she feels about a "real" relationship, but Rasheen's presence makes things awkward. Another of Sam's sometime girlfriends is Annie (Malin Akerman), who suffers from a rare medical condition that prevents her from having any hair. Though she's beautiful, Annie's lack of hair has caused her to have a dire self-image and she jumps from one relationship to another with a handful of men, some of whom treat her poorly. And Mary Catherine (Zoe Kazan) and Charlie (Pablo Schreiber) are a couple whose relationship is teetering on the brink as he considers a lucrative job offer in Los Angeles while she refuses to budge.

In the 1980s, Patrick (Derek Luke) and his wife Precious (Bonnie Henna) lived a peaceful life until one fateful day, when on an overnight trip with his team, Patrick is singled out as the prime suspect in a bombing at the refinery. Placed in solitary confinement, with his wife and family brutalized by government agent Nic Vos (Tim Robbins), the young family man is eventually cleared of charges, but his life is in shambles. Devastated and distraught, Patrick soon begins working as a rebel fighter and political operative for Nelson Mandela's African National Congress.

    <desc lang="en">This Steven Spielberg-directed exploration into a long-ago episode in African-American history recounts the trial that followed the 1839 rebellion aboard the Spanish slave ship Amistad and captures the complex political maneuverings set in motion by the event. Filmed in New England and Puerto Rico, the 152-minute drama opens with a pre-credit sequence showing Cinque (Djimon Hounsou) and the other Africans in a violent takeover of the Amistad. Captured, they are imprisoned in New England where former slave Theodore Joadson (Morgan Freeman), viewing the rebels as "freedom fighters," approaches property lawyer Baldwin (Matthew McConaughey), who attempts to prove the Africans were "stolen goods" because they were kidnapped. Running for re-election, President Martin Van Buren (Nigel Hawthorne) overturns the lower court's decision in favor of the Africans. Former President John Quincy Adams (Anthony Hopkins) is reluctant to become involved, but when the case moves on to the Supreme Court, Adams stirs emotions with a powerful defense. The storyline occasionally cuts away to Spain where the young Queen Isabella (Anna Paquin) plays with dolls; she later debated the Amistad case with seven U.S. presidents. The character portrayed by Morgan Freeman is a fictional composite of several historical figures. For authentic speech, the Africans speak the Mende language, subtitled during some scenes but not others(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Pilot. The pilot for "Jerry," the show about "nothing" created by Jerry and George is finally a go, so they begin casting actors for the roles of Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer. After an actor nails the audition for the part of Kramer, the real George becomes obsessed with the fact that a box of raisins turned up missing immediately after the actor left. And speaking of obsession, the president of NBC suddenly has an undying crush on Elaine, who herself is bent on proving that the owner of Monk's Diner only hires large-breasted women. Mariska Hargitay of ER and Law &amp; Order: SVU and Jeremy Piven guest star. First airing May 20, 1993, "The Pilot, Part 1" was originally the first half of the one-hour, fourth-season ender. The episode was later split in two for syndication(n)</desc>
