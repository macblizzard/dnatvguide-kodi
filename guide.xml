However, Marie finds what she thinks is urine and hair on the toilet seat in her room, and a lack of wi-fi means Billy Junior has to put his business on hold. Yvonne takes her competitors to a local reptile house, but serious divisions unfold within the group, and later, tensions rise again at dinner.(n)</desc>

Yvonne and Gail leave no mattress unturned in their room inspection, although Michael and Carole are impressed. Later, Yvonne makes quite a splash when the hosts organise an assault course for their guests, but slow service during breakfast leaves the B&amp;Bers disappointed - especially when Billy Jr is at a loss to explain what the problem was.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Dragonfly</title>
    <desc lang="en">Joe Darrow works as a doctor in the emergency room of Chicago Memorial Hospital. His wife, Emily Darrow, was last seen in a rainstorm in Venezuela, where she was on a retreat with the Red Cross offering humanitarian aid. She vanished in a bus accident. There were no survivors and her body was never found. That rich, green, exotic land is left behind as Joe is challenged to persevere through sad, rainy days back home. Joe promised Emily that if anything ever happened to her, he would visit her patients in the oncology ward. Strangely, the children seem to know him, and they say they've seen Emily in their near-death experiences. Joe starts to believe that his wife is using the near-death experiences of her terminal patients to communicate with him, through images the children report seeing in their dreams, and symbols they are inexplicably compelled to draw. While the children see Joe as a kindred spirit, the hospital staff worries about how these interactions are agitating them. At home, Joe begins finding other ethereal evidence of his wife's attempt to contact him from beyond the grave, some of it featuring the image of a dragonfly, which was the shape of the birthmark on her shoulder. His friends and a caring neighbor (Kathy Bates) worry that Joe is losing his marbles, especially as his quest becomes more frantic, putting his job in jeopardy(n)</desc>

A chain of evidence leads to an abandoned house containing blueprints for New Orleans' electric grids, as well as the murder weapon, and as Pride and his colleagues investigate further, they begin to suspect Nick's death and the blackout are connected to an opportunistic gang planning to use the power cut as a cover for a looting spree. However, there is more to the case than meets the eye. Crime drama, starring Scott Bakula.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Pocahontas</title>
    <desc lang="en">Set in 1607, it tells of the beautiful, brave and compassionate daughter of Chief Powhatan who speaks to her forest friends (Meeko the raccoon, Flit the hummingbird and Grandmother Willow, a 400 year old spirit that resides in an ancient tree) for advice. It tells how her life changes when she meets John Smith, one of a party of sailors which has come to the New World searching for gold. The powerful and moving story of a Native American princess and her ill-fated love for an English sea captain, Pocahontas is a stunning piece of state of the art animation. Pocahontas teaches him the true value of life, and how every rock tree and creature has a living spirit. She saves him from execution by her people, and he in turn saves Powahatan but is wounded. Eventually they are forced to part, but their spirits remain entwined. This beautiful and moving story, enhanced by a superb soundtrack, make Disney's 33rd animated feature film an unmissable gem(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Mental illness stretches a loving family to the breaking point in this independent drama. Chris Marino (Devon Gearhart) is a ten-year-old boy growing up in a small oceanside community in Florida. Chris's father John (Joe Pantoliano) is a construction worker who is struggling to hold the family together under difficult circumstances -- his wife and Chris' mother, Mary (Marcia Gay Harden), has been diagnosed with schizophrenia, and while they've been pursuing a variety of treatment options, Mary's condition continues to slowly deteriorate as she hears phantom sounds, has hallucinations, and becomes increasingly paranoid. While Joe tries to explain Mary's disease to Chris, her actions have turned her into an increasingly frightening and embarrassing stranger to her son, and Mary is clearly aware of the toll her condition has taken on the family but cannot help herself. After a violent incident results in a call from the police, Mary enters a mental hospital, and as Joe begins to buckle under the pressure of his circumstances, he quits his job and devotes all his spare time to building a sailboat, a project that reminds him of better days for Mary and himself. Canvas was the first feature film from writer and director Joseph Greco, who drew inspiration from the story of his mother, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia when he was growing up(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">(2010) Michael Cera (Juno, Superbad) stars in this unconventionally structured, inventive and comic paean to the alternate universe of manga and computer gaming. The movie is based on an acclaimed series of graphic novels by Canadian cartoonist Bryan Lee O'Malley, and is directed by British film-maker Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Channel 4's TV series Spaced), here making his Hollywood debut. Computer game fanatic Scott Pilgrim (Cera) is the bass player with Toronto band Sex Bob-omb. He shares his flat with his slightly-out-of-control gay friend Wallace Wells (Kieran Culkin), and courts a little controversy by dating 17-year-old schoolgirl Knives Chau (Ellen Wong). However, theirs is a fairly platonic relationship, and one he's prepared to ditch the moment he sets eyes on the woman (literally) of his dreams: Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). But if Scott wants to capture the impossibly cool New Yorker's heart, he must first defeat her former lovers, the Seven Evil Exes, in video game end-level-style combat. So he embarks on a kinetic, romantic quest, largely conducted within his own head, replete with slapstick violence, impressive effects and witty retorts(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Bird on a Wire</title>
    <desc lang="en">The can't-miss teaming of Mel Gibson and Goldie Hawn is squandered on a clumsy, illogical romantic melodrama. Running across her old boyfriend Gibson at a Wisconsin gas station, Hawn is astounded that he seems not to recognize her. How could she have known that Gibson was put into the Witness Relocation Program after testifying against a homicidal mob boss (say, don't they usually alter your appearance when they put you in that program?) Curious over Gibson's furtive behavior, Hawn unknowingly sets herself up as a target for the bad guys. The whole affairs culminates in an after-hours showdown at a zoo (a plot device vastly improved upon in the 1996 Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle Eraser). While Bird on a Wire admittedly has its moments of enjoyment, most of the film is on a par with Gibson's embarrassing, homophobic scene with a pair of epicine hairdressers. And whoever heard of the Chinatown section of Racine, Wisconsin?(n)</desc>

Twenty years later, the adult Quinn is the fire chief of a refortified castle community, responsible for dousing the blazes lit by the dragon's prodigious number of flame-spewing offspring, airborne juggernauts that have wreaked havoc across the globe, torching civilization and turning humans into an endangered species. Hope arrives in the form of Denton "Dragon Slayer" Van Zan, an American known to be the only man to ever kill one of the dragons, and Alex Jenson, a scientist/pilot who's a member of Van Zan's army, a zealous fighting force that includes a secret weapon: the Archangels, paratroopers using themselves as bait to attract and then dispatch the deadly beasts(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The first of two documentaries going behind-the-scenes at Buckingham Palace to find out what life is like beyond its grand exterior. The programmes look back at the 60 years since the Queen's Coronation and explores what might happen to the palace when Prince Charles takes the throne. The opening instalment examines the young Queen's ascent to the throne at the age of 25, Philip's extended overseas visit, and the serious security threats in the 1970s. It also explores the battles between Charles and Diana, Anne and Andrew's divorce, and the use of the palace as a royal stage.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Although it is closed and secretive, Buckingham Palace has become a symbol of everything British, despite only being a royal palace for less that 200 years. This second of two programmes reflects on previous monarchs' accomplishments during their reign, from Edward VII's commitment in 1901 to making the palace a royal stage, to George V's decision to change the family name from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to Windsor. Finally, the programme considers the next King, who could bring about another revolution at the palace and change its role further in the future.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Johnson Family Vacation</title>
    <desc lang="en">Comedian Cedric the Entertainer serves as both producer and star of this comedy about a family who discovers just how much can go wrong en route to a family get-together. When Nate Johnson (Cedric the Entertainer) is invited to a big family reunion in Missouri, he sees it as an opportunity to reconnect with his estranged wife and growing children, as well as a chance to show up his wealthier know-it-all brother, Mack (Steve Harvey). Nate takes delivery on an expensive new SUV, persuades his recently separated wife, Dorothy (Vanessa L. Williams), to tag along, and packs up his three kids -- nubile teenager Nikki (Solange Knowles), under-age wannabe rapper D.J. (Bow Wow), and precocious seven-year-old Destiny (Gabby Soleil) -- for what he imagines will be a leisurely drive from Los Angeles to St. Louis. However, between his wary wife, arguing kids, angry police officers, bizarre hitchhikers, bad diner food, and an unfortunate run-in with a cement mixer, getting from point A to point B proves to be just short of a nightmare. Johnson Family Vacation was the first feature film for director Christopher Erskin, who previously distinguished himself directing music videos for the likes of Missy Elliot, TLC, and Boyz II Men(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Scott Pilgrim vs. the World</title>
    <desc lang="en">(2010) Michael Cera (Juno, Superbad) stars in this unconventionally structured, inventive and comic paean to the alternate universe of manga and computer gaming. The movie is based on an acclaimed series of graphic novels by Canadian cartoonist Bryan Lee O'Malley, and is directed by British film-maker Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Channel 4's TV series Spaced), here making his Hollywood debut. Computer game fanatic Scott Pilgrim (Cera) is the bass player with Toronto band Sex Bob-omb. He shares his flat with his slightly-out-of-control gay friend Wallace Wells (Kieran Culkin), and courts a little controversy by dating 17-year-old schoolgirl Knives Chau (Ellen Wong). However, theirs is a fairly platonic relationship, and one he's prepared to ditch the moment he sets eyes on the woman (literally) of his dreams: Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). But if Scott wants to capture the impossibly cool New Yorker's heart, he must first defeat her former lovers, the Seven Evil Exes, in video game end-level-style combat. So he embarks on a kinetic, romantic quest, largely conducted within his own head, replete with slapstick violence, impressive effects and witty retorts(n)</desc>

However, between his wary wife, arguing kids, angry police officers, bizarre hitchhikers, bad diner food, and an unfortunate run-in with a cement mixer, getting from point A to point B proves to be just short of a nightmare. Johnson Family Vacation was the first feature film for director Christopher Erskin, who previously distinguished himself directing music videos for the likes of Missy Elliot, TLC, and Boyz II Men(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">(2010) Michael Cera (Juno, Superbad) stars in this unconventionally structured, inventive and comic paean to the alternate universe of manga and computer gaming. The movie is based on an acclaimed series of graphic novels by Canadian cartoonist Bryan Lee O'Malley, and is directed by British film-maker Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Channel 4's TV series Spaced), here making his Hollywood debut. Computer game fanatic Scott Pilgrim (Cera) is the bass player with Toronto band Sex Bob-omb. He shares his flat with his slightly-out-of-control gay friend Wallace Wells (Kieran Culkin), and courts a little controversy by dating 17-year-old schoolgirl Knives Chau (Ellen Wong). However, theirs is a fairly platonic relationship, and one he's prepared to ditch the moment he sets eyes on the woman (literally) of his dreams: Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). But if Scott wants to capture the impossibly cool New Yorker's heart, he must first defeat her former lovers, the Seven Evil Exes, in video game end-level-style combat. So he embarks on a kinetic, romantic quest, largely conducted within his own head, replete with slapstick violence, impressive effects and witty retorts(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The director of the Academy Award-winning 2006 crime drama Tsotsi returns to the helm with this tale of a Middle East CIA operative who begins to have doubts about his latest assignment after witnessing the interrogation of a suspected suicide bomber by secret police. When Egyptian-born chemical engineer Anwar El-Ibrahimi (Omar Metwally) mysteriously vanishes on a routine flight from South Africa to Washington, his wife, Isabella (Reese Witherspoon), embarks on a frantic international search for her missing husband. At the same time, a CIA analyst (Jake Gyllenhaal) arrives at a clandestine detention facility outside of United States. As the interrogation of El-Ibrahimi gets under way, the CIA analyst is profoundly shaken by the unorthodox methods used by the man's captors, and quickly begins to reevaluate his assignment.

    <desc lang="en">Dead Woman Walking: The Karla Faye Tucker Story. This documentary, part of the American Justice series from A&amp;E, examines the Texas death penalty case of Karla Faye Walker. Narrated by American Justice host and producer Bill Kurtis, this episode goes inside the investigation of the two murders that Walker and her boyfriend Daniel Ryan Garrett committed. The trial of Walker is shown through exclusive footage. After the conviction, American Justice follows her through her daily life, showing her prison surroundings and talking with her about her crimes. Sentenced to death, while Walker was waiting to be executed, she became a born-again Christian. Her lawyers used this transformation as leverage to try to get her death sentence reduced to life in prison. Their attempts were unsuccessful and Walker was killed by lethal injection in February 1998. American Justice also shows interviews with lawyers and law enforcement professionals who knew Walker(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Presenters Ellie Harrison and Max Hug Williams follow orphaned baby animals as they make steps to return to the wild. Ellie travels to Australia to meet three koalas called Tilly, Puddles and Danny, who were rescued from the roadside where their mother had been killed - Danny needs around-the-clock care and is building up his strength with night-time games of chase. She also meets a tiny wallaby called Neil, whose carer Stella is worried may die from stress if they can't find him a companion. Elsewhere, wildlife cameraman Max is in Costa Rica where he gets acquainted with Newbie, a five-month-old three-toed sloth who has suffered from pneumonia since she was rescued. He follows wildlife manager Sam at Kids Saving the Rainforest as she tries to teach the baby sloth to climb trees and learn to go back to the wild.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Sight.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Biologist Patrick Aryee and physicist Helen Czerski explore the world of animal senses to reveal how they detect things beyond the limits of human perception, conducting experiments and demonstrations featuring a variety of species. They begin by investigating sight and reveal how caribou - wild reindeer of Alaska - use ultraviolet light to avoid their predators. They also discover how the dragonfly's ability to view things in slow motion allows it to make a kill, and show how a snake can see in the pitch dark without using its eyes.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Biologist Patrick Aryee and physicist Helen Czerski continue their exploration of the world of animal senses by investigating sound - from the deepest rumbles to the highest squeaks - using specialised technology to detect noises beyond the range of human hearing. They reveal how alligators use low-pitch sounds to make the water around them `dance', show what it is like to be a bat and see with echo-location, and convert a classic camper van into a giant speaker to conduct the ultimate hearing test for a herd of elephants.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">There's Something About Mary</title>
    <desc lang="en">Ben Stiller plays high school geek Ted, invited to the prom by the gorgeous Mary. He can hardly believe his luck; but the night goes wrong when he arrives to pick up his date, and has a painful accident in the toilet, failing to stow his tackle before zipping up. Thirteen years later Ted still yearns for what might have been and hires private dick Pat Healy to find Mary. The detective succeeds but also falls for her and feeds Ted false information so he can keep her for himself. But a suspicious Ted takes matters into his own hands and finds he's in the middle of a love pentagon also involving an architect and an NFL quarterback. With the addition of gags involving a speed-freaked dog, Mary's use of what she believes is Ted's hair gel and a minstrel troupe who follow Ted around, the resulting comedy may not be subtle but is very funny(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This (13th) time around, 007 (once again played by Roger Moore) receives the usual call to come and visit M when another agent drops off a fake Faberge jeweled egg at the British embassy in East Berlin and is later killed at a traveling circus. Suspicions mount when the assistant manager of the circus Kamal (Louis Jourdan), outbids Bond for the real Faberge piece at Sotheby's. Bond follows Kamal to India where the superspy thwarts many an ingenious attack and encounters the antiheroine of the title (Maud Adams), an international smuggler who runs the circus as a cover for her illegal operations. It does not take long to figure out that Orlov (Steven Berkoff), a decidedly rank Russian general is planning to raise enough money with the fake Faberges to detonate a nuclear bomb in Europe and then defeat NATO forces once and for all in conventional warfare. John Glen returns again to handle directing duties, the second of five Bond films he lensed(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Jim Davis' famous cartoon cat finally makes his way to the big screen in this adaptation of the popular comic strip Garfield, which combines live action with CGI animation. Jon Arbuckle (Breckin Meyer) is a sweet, if somewhat clueless, man who shares his home with his pet cat, Garfield (voice of Bill Murray). Garfield is not your ordinary tabby -- he's fat, he's smart-mouthed, he's arrogant, he won't do anything he doesn't have to, and would rather stuff himself with lasagna than do something Jon asks of him. Despite this, Jon loves his cat, but when he decides to expand his animal family, Garfield is less than enthusiastic about the presence of Odie, a lovably enthusiastic dog whose only flaw is his extreme stupidity. While Jon is crazy for Odie, and especially likes having two pets that necessitate periodic visits to Dr. Liz Wilson (Jennifer Love Hewitt), a veterinarian he has a crush on, Garfield decides to remove Odie from the picture. Garfield arranges for Odie to become the property of Happy Chapman (Stephen Tobolowsky), a television host who acts like an animal lover on the round-cornered screen but doesn't much like pets on his own time. While Garfield at first enjoys ruling the roost again, he soon realizes the error of his ways, and in a rare example of selfless and ambitious behavior, hatches a plan to rescue Odie from Chapman. Garfield also features the voice talents of Debra Messing, Brad Garrett, Jimmy Kimmel, and Alan Cumming(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Jim Davis' famous cartoon cat finally makes his way to the big screen in this adaptation of the popular comic strip Garfield, which combines live action with CGI animation. Jon Arbuckle (Breckin Meyer) is a sweet, if somewhat clueless, man who shares his home with his pet cat, Garfield (voice of Bill Murray). Garfield is not your ordinary tabby -- he's fat, he's smart-mouthed, he's arrogant, he won't do anything he doesn't have to, and would rather stuff himself with lasagna than do something Jon asks of him. Despite this, Jon loves his cat, but when he decides to expand his animal family, Garfield is less than enthusiastic about the presence of Odie, a lovably enthusiastic dog whose only flaw is his extreme stupidity. While Jon is crazy for Odie, and especially likes having two pets that necessitate periodic visits to Dr. Liz Wilson (Jennifer Love Hewitt), a veterinarian he has a crush on, Garfield decides to remove Odie from the picture. Garfield arranges for Odie to become the property of Happy Chapman (Stephen Tobolowsky), a television host who acts like an animal lover on the round-cornered screen but doesn't much like pets on his own time. While Garfield at first enjoys ruling the roost again, he soon realizes the error of his ways, and in a rare example of selfless and ambitious behavior, hatches a plan to rescue Odie from Chapman. Garfield also features the voice talents of Debra Messing, Brad Garrett, Jimmy Kimmel, and Alan Cumming(n)</desc>

However, it seems that the American public have fallen out of love with their superheroes, one of whom, Dr Manhattan, was largely responsible for the winning the VIetnam War. Now, he and his fellow crime-fighters are regarded as reprehensible vigilantes and have been banned by law.

They discover that a terrifying plan is afoot..(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead</title>
    <desc lang="en">Christina Applegate stars in this convoluted comedy that comes across as a teen fantasy combination of Home Alone and Working Girl. The premise is all in the title -- when the mother (Concetta Tomei) of a sniveling group of surly kids goes on a much-deserved summer vacation, she leaves her kids under the charge of an elderly distaff granny (Eda Reiss Merin). When granny ups and dies, the kids load her dead body in a trunk and deposit the package on the steps of the local funeral home. The kids are ecstatic thinking that with the big wad of cash Mom has left, they can have a summer of consumer madness. But when they find out that the money has been buried with the baby-sitter, the kids have to fend for themselves to make ends meet. Dream teen Sue Ellen (Christina Applegate) tries working at a fast food restaurant but she can't stand the grease. So, she puts together a false resume and, posing as a twenty-eight-year old, she applies for a job as a receptionist at a garment manufacturing company. The company vice president, Rose (Joanna Cassidy), is so impressed by her resume that she hires her on the spot as her executive assistant. Her deception looks to be working out great -- Sue Ellen manages to hold off the office lady killer Gus (John Getz), avoids exposure by the embittered receptionist, borrows money from the company's petty cash box for household incidentals, and continues her relationship with restaurant employee Bryan (Josh Charles). But suddenly, the clothing firm is set to go under, and Sue Ellen must use her teen fashion sense to save the company and her job . . . and she has to get the rest of the brood involved(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Parenthood</title>
    <desc lang="en">This feel-good ensemble comedy tracks a quartet of suburban siblings and their families over the course of a single summer. Hardworking Gil Buckman (Steve Martin) and his stay-at-home wife, Karen (Mary Steeenburgen), have just a few months to help their oldest son, Kevin (Jasen Fisher), overcome his high-strung behavior problems before he'll be relegated to special-education classes. Gil's difficult relationship with his own father, Frank (Jason Robards), has led him to become a would-be super-dad for his three kids, so he takes his son's difficulties more than a little personally. Gil's sister, Helen (Dianne Wiest), is trying to raise a moody, adolescent son (Leaf Phoenix) and an independent-minded daughter (Martha Plimpton) with no help from her well-off ex-husband, who's more interested in his new wife and family. Gil and Helen's sister, Susan (Harley Jane Kozak), meanwhile, must participate in the too-scripted Big Life Plans of her anal-retentive husband, Nathan (Rick Moranis), whose overachiever zeal infects even their toddler daughter. When long-lost brother Larry (Tom Hulce) show up with yet another get-rich-quick scheme, he brings with him a surprise addition to the family. Screenwriters Babaloo Mandel, Lowell Ganz, and Ron Howard negotiate their varied subplots with a deftness and comedic touch that transforms this conflicted clan into a suburban everyfamily(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">About a Boy</title>
    <desc lang="en">London's most frequently eligible bachelor gets some lessons in growing up from a maladroit 12-year-old boy in this third big-screen adaptation of a Nick Hornby novel, directed and co-written by siblings Chris and Paul Weitz of American Pie fame. About a Boy concerns the parallel coming-of-age stories of the thirtysomething Will (Hugh Grant), a layabout "serial nice guy" living a posh, carefree lifestyle off his deceased father's fortune; and the preteen Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), a bright but awkward youth who's tired of his mom Fiona's (Toni Collette) depressed, boyfriend-less state. Their paths collide when Will, deciding that single mothers are the easiest romantic conquests on the dating scene, fabricates a two-year-old son and joins a group called S.P.A.T. (Single Parents Alone Together). Marcus is wise to Will's scheme, however, and through some incessant pestering and blackmail, he contrives for Will to date Fiona. Though Will doesn't hit it off immediately with either Marcus or his mother, he gradually begins to open up to the people around him -- so much so that he attracts the attention of another attractive single mom (Rachel Weisz). A U.S./U.K. co-production of Robert DeNiro's Tribeca Films and Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner's Working Title (the company responsible for the Grant-related Four Weddings and a Funeral and Bridget Jones's Diary), About a Boy was co-written by What's Eating Gilbert Grape creator Peter Hedges(n)</desc>

Jack Lemmon is John Gustafson, an ice-fishing Minnesota native who has been feuding with his neighbor and former best friend Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) for decades. The battle of wills between John and Max is characterized by crude name calling and harmless practical jokes. Max is unaware that John is having serious problems, chiefly that his daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah) is experiencing marital woes and that his house is about to be confiscated by an officious IRS agent (Buck Henry). When it seems that John and Max may finally put aside their childish rivalry, however, sexy new neighbor Ariel (Ann-Margret) arrives and dates both men, pitting them against each other more fiercely than ever before. Despite their mutual loathing, the death of a friend, John's problems, and a budding romance between Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) and Melanie may force the two old friends to reconcile(n)</desc>

Jack Lemmon is John Gustafson, an ice-fishing Minnesota native who has been feuding with his neighbor and former best friend Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) for decades. The battle of wills between John and Max is characterized by crude name calling and harmless practical jokes. Max is unaware that John is having serious problems, chiefly that his daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah) is experiencing marital woes and that his house is about to be confiscated by an officious IRS agent (Buck Henry). When it seems that John and Max may finally put aside their childish rivalry, however, sexy new neighbor Ariel (Ann-Margret) arrives and dates both men, pitting them against each other more fiercely than ever before. Despite their mutual loathing, the death of a friend, John's problems, and a budding romance between Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) and Melanie may force the two old friends to reconcile(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Garfield: The Movie</title>
    <desc lang="en">Jim Davis' famous cartoon cat finally makes his way to the big screen in this adaptation of the popular comic strip Garfield, which combines live action with CGI animation. Jon Arbuckle (Breckin Meyer) is a sweet, if somewhat clueless, man who shares his home with his pet cat, Garfield (voice of Bill Murray). Garfield is not your ordinary tabby -- he's fat, he's smart-mouthed, he's arrogant, he won't do anything he doesn't have to, and would rather stuff himself with lasagna than do something Jon asks of him. Despite this, Jon loves his cat, but when he decides to expand his animal family, Garfield is less than enthusiastic about the presence of Odie, a lovably enthusiastic dog whose only flaw is his extreme stupidity. While Jon is crazy for Odie, and especially likes having two pets that necessitate periodic visits to Dr. Liz Wilson (Jennifer Love Hewitt), a veterinarian he has a crush on, Garfield decides to remove Odie from the picture. Garfield arranges for Odie to become the property of Happy Chapman (Stephen Tobolowsky), a television host who acts like an animal lover on the round-cornered screen but doesn't much like pets on his own time. While Garfield at first enjoys ruling the roost again, he soon realizes the error of his ways, and in a rare example of selfless and ambitious behavior, hatches a plan to rescue Odie from Chapman. Garfield also features the voice talents of Debra Messing, Brad Garrett, Jimmy Kimmel, and Alan Cumming(n)</desc>

Brilliant scientist Dr Tenma (Cage) is left devastated when his young son is killed during an experiment, and tries to recreate a robotic version of the boy, only to abandon him when he fails to meet expectations. Left to fend for himself, the robot becomes Astro Boy, possessed of a host of useful powers, not the least of which is the ability to fire bullets from his backside. When he becomes embroiled in a plot to exploit a new source of energy, Astro Boy must use all of his gifts to defeat the forces of evil. The array of vocal talent in attendance includes Samuel L Jackson, Donald Sutherland, Bill Nighy, Nathan Lane, Charlize Theron, Kristen Bell and Little Britain's Matt Lucas(n)</desc>

However, this is Baltimore and it is 1962 - and Tracy's both overweight and, worse, has liberal attitudes to race relations, which don't sit comfortably with the segregationist views of the show's producer.

    <title lang="en">The World According to Garp</title>
    <desc lang="en">The 1982 film version of the John Irving novel The World According to Garp attempts to captures the quirky spirit while condensing the Irving original. Robin Williams plays the title character, the son of unmarried, unorthodox feminist Jenny Fields (Glenn Close, in her film debut). Every effort made by Jenny to broaden Garp's outlook on life -- she even arranges for him to spend the night with a hooker (Swoosie Kurtz) -- crams more fears and phobias into his psyche. Aspiring to become a novelist, Garp succeeds in this goal at the same time that his mother publishes her first feminist manifesto. Though successful and happily married to college sweetheart Helen Holm (Mary Beth Hurt), Garp remains envious of his fearless mother, who has taken in the radical "Ellen Jamesians," a group named after a young woman who had her tongue cut out by a rapist. Mutilation, in fact, becomes something of a leitmotif in Garp's life, climaxing (in every sense of the word) in an auto accident brought about by Helen's tryst with Michael Milton (Mark Soper). There is, of course, much more to the story than this: standing out amongst the dozens of offbeat supporting characters is John Lithgow as Roberta Muldoon, a transexual ex-football jock. John Irving appears as a referee during a college wrestling match, while director George Roy Hill plays the pilot whose low-flying plane crashes into Garp's new home. The World According to Garp didn't attract as large an audience as other, more conventional Robin Williams vehicles, though Close and Lithgow would both be nominated for Best Supporting Actor statues(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Mr. Monk and the Billionaire Mugger. Apparently suffering from a mid-life crisis that causes moments of bizarre whimsy, billionaire computer executive Sidney Teal (J.C. McKenzie) pulls a gun and attempts to rob a couple outside a restaurant--and is killed in the process. Though beset with financial problems, and facing the possible loss of his trusted nurse Sharona (Bitty Schram), Monk (Tony Shalhoub)agrees to investigate Teal's death, and the reasons behind it. Perhaps the answer can be gleaned from the two people whom the dead man mugged...or perhaps the solution is in the hands of Officer Moretta (Jonathan Rannells) the cop at the crime scene who inexplicably ran away before back-up arrived--and hasn't been seen since. (Note: the scene in which Monk discusses clues pertaining to the earlier death of his wife with writer Kelly Street [Mary Black] was actually filmed for, but removed from, Monk's two-hour pilot episode)(n)</desc>

Under normal circumstances, the principal suspect would be Gwen's lover, brash young furniture mogul Trevor McDowell (Peter Outerbridge). But McDowell has the perfect alibi: He was running in the marathon, and he has irrefutable evidence to prove it. Still convinced that McDowell is guilty, Monk hopes that he can prove his theory with the roundabout assistance of his lifelong idol, legendary Nigerian marathoner Tonday Mawaaka (Zakes Mokae)--not to mention his own long-suppressed running skills!(n)</desc>

Monk's disorder was triggered by the murder of his beloved wife, Trudy, which continues to haunt him as the only unsolved mystery in his career. Ordered to take a leave of absence from the police department, Monk hires Sharona, a nurse who helps him try to get reinstated on the force, and in the process, becomes an unlikely Dr. Watson to his Sherlock Holmes. When the police department find themselves unable to crack a high-profile case, they have no choice but to bring back the only man for the job...phobias and all(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A doctor dabbles in magical resurrection with horrific consequences in this supernatural thriller adapted from the novel by Stephen King. When Dr. Louis Creed (Dale Midkiff) and his family move from Chicago to an old farmhouse in rural Maine, their only concern is the busy highway that flanks their new home. Louis' family -- wife Rachel (Denise Crosby), daughter Ellie (Blaze Berdahl), and toddler Gage (Miko Hughes) -- soon meet kindly old duffer Jud Crandall (Fred Gwynne), who introduces them all to the local attractions, including a pet cemetary built on the remains of a Native American burial ground. When Rachel and the kids head off to visit Louis' in-laws, Ellie's cat gets flattened by a truck. Jud counsels Louis to bury it in the old Indian portion of the cemetary; the next day, it returns from the dead, carrying with it the stink of the earth and a decidedly bad attitude. Shortly thereafter, Louis is tempted to use the cemetary's magical powers again when his son suffers a tragic accident. A snarling kitty, it turns out, is nothing compared to the horror of a little boy with no soul and a taste for scalpels. In addition to adapting his own novel for the screen, writer King appeared in a brief cameo as the minister presiding over Gage's funeral. Director Mary Lambert would return with Pet Sematary Two(n)</desc>

Dropping tokens down a choice of four chutes, they hope to knock piles of them off a moving shelf - and the more they collect, the greater the prize fund. The player who has won the least amount is then eliminated, and the last one standing competes for a £10,000 jackpot.(n)</desc>

This programme charts the Queen Mother's efforts to protect the royal reputation she helped rebuild after the abdication of Edward VIII.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Matt Lucas narrates a look back at the decade's TV shows, meeting people who appeared in them, those who watched them and their creators. The first of two programmes focuses on pleasure and leisure on 1970s television, with featured clips including outrageous adult jokes in pre-watershed sitcoms, smoking cigarettes on prime-time panel shows, a surprising history lesson aimed at children, and St Bernard dogs being offered for prizes. The footage is also seen through the eyes of people who missed the decade altogether and who find the moral values exhibited to be a real eye-opener.(n)</desc>

So how did the shooter manage to slip through undetected? As if that wasn't enough for Humphrey to worry about, he also has an unexpected visit from his father (guest star James Fox), with whom he doesn't exactly see eye to eye.

He begins by revealing how Galapagos rose from the ocean four million years ago.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Olivier Megaton takes the helm for the third instalment in the high-octane action thriller franchise. Jason Statham returns to his role as Frank Martin, the crook's courier of choice for legally dubious goods. In this outing he is employed by a group of environmental terrorists to drive across Europe with Valentina, the kidnapped daughter of a Ukrainian government minister. To make their journey more 'interesting', the pair are fitted with bracelets which will explode if either strays too far from their car.

    <title lang="en">Tyler Perry's Diary of a Mad Black Woman</title>
    <desc lang="en">A woman has to learn how to love and trust men all over again in this comedy drama. Helen McCarter (Kimberly Elise) would seem to have it all -- she's been married for 18 years to Charles (Steve Harris), and over the course of their time together, he's become one of Atlanta's most successful attorneys. But despite wealth and prestige, things are not as they should be at the McCarter home, and on their anniversary, Charles drops a bombshell on Helen -- he's divorcing her for another woman. Escorted out of the house with nowhere to go, Helen moves in with her grandmother Madea (Tyler Perry), a sassy woman with no shortage of opinions and a gun that she's not afraid to use. As Madea helps Helen get back on her feet emotionally, the divorcée makes the acquaintance of Orlando (Shemar Moore), a handsome man who is obviously attracted to her. But after her experiences with Charles, Helen isn't sure if she's ready to trust a man again. Diary of a Mad Black Woman was adapted from the popular stage play by Tyler Perry, who also plays several roles in the film, most prominently Madea; it marked the first feature-film credit for successful music video director Darren R. Grant(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Tyler Perry's Diary of a Mad Black Woman</title>
    <desc lang="en">A woman has to learn how to love and trust men all over again in this comedy drama. Helen McCarter (Kimberly Elise) would seem to have it all -- she's been married for 18 years to Charles (Steve Harris), and over the course of their time together, he's become one of Atlanta's most successful attorneys. But despite wealth and prestige, things are not as they should be at the McCarter home, and on their anniversary, Charles drops a bombshell on Helen -- he's divorcing her for another woman. Escorted out of the house with nowhere to go, Helen moves in with her grandmother Madea (Tyler Perry), a sassy woman with no shortage of opinions and a gun that she's not afraid to use. As Madea helps Helen get back on her feet emotionally, the divorcée makes the acquaintance of Orlando (Shemar Moore), a handsome man who is obviously attracted to her. But after her experiences with Charles, Helen isn't sure if she's ready to trust a man again. Diary of a Mad Black Woman was adapted from the popular stage play by Tyler Perry, who also plays several roles in the film, most prominently Madea; it marked the first feature-film credit for successful music video director Darren R. Grant(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Babe</title>
    <desc lang="en">A young pig fights convention to become a sheep dog -- or, rather, sheep pig -- in this charming Australian family film, which became an unexpected international success due to superior special effects and an intelligent script. The title refers to the name bestowed on a piglet soon after his separation from his family, when he finds himself on a strange farm. Confused and sad, Babe is adopted by a friendly dog and slowly adjusts to his new home. Discovering that the fate of most pigs is the dinner table, Babe devotes himself to becoming a useful member of the farm by trying to learn how to herd sheep, despite the skepticism of the other animals and the kindly but conventional Farmer Hoggett (James Cromwell). Because technically impeccable animatronics and computer graphics allow the farm animals to converse easily among themselves, first-time director Chris Noonan can treat the film's menagerie as actual characters, playing scene not for cuteness but for real emotions. The result is often surprisingly touching, with Noonan and George Miller's script, based on Dick King-Smith's children's book and, indirectly, a true story, seamlessly combining gentle whimsy and sincere feeling. These same qualities are embodied by in Cromwell's beautifully understated performance as Farmer Hoggett, which anchors the film. Despite its unlikely premise and low profile, Babe's inspirational story was embraced by audiences and critics, and the movie became an international sleeper that won an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. It was followed in 1999 by the less successful Babe: Pig in the City(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Sting</title>
    <desc lang="en">Four years after setting box offices ablaze in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Paul Newman, Robert Redford, and director George Roy Hill re-teamed with similar success for The Sting. Redford plays Depression-era confidence trickster Johnny Hooker, whose friend and mentor Luther Coleman (Robert Earl Jones) is murdered by racketeer/gambler Doyle Lonnegan (Robert Shaw). Hoping to avenge Luther's death, Johnny begins planning a "sting" -- an elaborate scam -- to destroy Lonnegan. He enlists the aid of "the greatest con artist of them all," Henry Gondorff (Paul Newman), who pulls himself out of a drunken stupor and rises to the occasion. Hooker and Gondorff gather together an impressive array of con men, all of whom despise Lonnegan and wish to settle accounts on behalf of Luther. The twists and surprises that follow are too complex to relate in detail -- suffice to say that you can't cheat an honest man, and that you shouldn't accept everything at face value. The Sting became one of the biggest hits of the early '70s; grossing 68.5 million dollars during its first run, the film also picked up seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, and Best Adapted Score for Marvin Hamlisch's unforgettable setting of Scott Joplin's ragtime music(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Longest Yard</title>
    <desc lang="en">One of the toughest and best-remembered sports movies of the 1970s gets a humorous makeover in this comedy. Paul "Wrecking" Crewe (Adam Sandler) was once a famous professional football player, but after several years out of the limelight and an alcohol problem have taken their toll, Crewe is arrested for a serious traffic accident aggravated by the fact he was drunk. Crewe is sentenced to Allenville Penitentiary, where Warden Hazen (James Cromwell) is something of a football fan. Hazen had organized his guards into an impressive football team, and clears a healthy profit by taking bets on their games. Looking to make the competition more interesting, Hazen suggests that Crewe put together a team from the inmate population to play his guards. With the help of fellow prisoner Caretaker (Chris Rock), Crewe recruits the heaviest hitters from the cell block for the team, but the guys don't play like a unit until Crewe and Caretaker get some help from Nate Scarborough (Burt Reynolds), a former college and NFL coach doing hard time. Adapted from Robert Aldrich's 1974 box-office smash of the same name, The Longest Yard also features rap star Nelly and Nicholas Turturro; the film has previously been loosely remade in 2001 as Mean Machine, with the action moved to England and the game changed to soccer(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Longest Yard</title>
    <desc lang="en">One of the toughest and best-remembered sports movies of the 1970s gets a humorous makeover in this comedy. Paul "Wrecking" Crewe (Adam Sandler) was once a famous professional football player, but after several years out of the limelight and an alcohol problem have taken their toll, Crewe is arrested for a serious traffic accident aggravated by the fact he was drunk. Crewe is sentenced to Allenville Penitentiary, where Warden Hazen (James Cromwell) is something of a football fan. Hazen had organized his guards into an impressive football team, and clears a healthy profit by taking bets on their games. Looking to make the competition more interesting, Hazen suggests that Crewe put together a team from the inmate population to play his guards. With the help of fellow prisoner Caretaker (Chris Rock), Crewe recruits the heaviest hitters from the cell block for the team, but the guys don't play like a unit until Crewe and Caretaker get some help from Nate Scarborough (Burt Reynolds), a former college and NFL coach doing hard time. Adapted from Robert Aldrich's 1974 box-office smash of the same name, The Longest Yard also features rap star Nelly and Nicholas Turturro; the film has previously been loosely remade in 2001 as Mean Machine, with the action moved to England and the game changed to soccer(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A clumsy criminal is put in a position where he not only has to save his own skin, but that of his girlfriend in this comedy with strong undercurrents of romance. Jerry Welbach (Brad Pitt) is a low-level Mafia "mechanic" whose ineptitude is countered by frequent (but unpredictable) bursts of dumb luck. Jerry's girlfriend Samantha (Julia Roberts) wants him to get out of the business, and after his latest blunder lands capo Arnold Margolese (Gene Hackman) in jail, so does mid-level crime kingpin Bernie Nayman (Bob Balaban). But Bernie insists that Jerry do one last errand for the mob before they let him find employment elsewhere -- he has to go to Mexico and recover a rare and very valuable pistol, which is said to be cursed. While Samantha objects to Jerry taking the assignment, he isn't in much of a position to argue; Jerry heads south of the border, while Samantha, in a huff, sets out for Las Vegas. Once in Mexico, Jerry finds the pistol easily enough, but making his way back to the States proves to be an unexpected challenge. Meanwhile, Jerry's superiors want insurance that he'll return with the goods, so they hire Leroy (James Gandolfini), a hitman, to kidnap Samantha and hold her hostage until Jerry comes back. However, Samantha and Leroy quickly strike up a friendship, and she soon learns the gunman has a sensitive side he doesn't show to the world -- along with a few other secrets. The Mexican marked the first screen pairing for mega-stars Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt -- though, given the film's narrative arc, they play only a handful of scenes together. The film was directed by Gore Verbinski, who won awards for his work in commercials before breaking through with the quirky family comedy Mouse Hunt(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">After the little white lies of Romy and Michele's High School Reunion (1997), director David Mirkin focuses on scheming of a different sort in Heartbreakers. Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt play Max and Page Conners, a mother and daughter who share everything with each other: relationship advice, hair and makeup hints, and the money they win in costly divorce settlements with rich men. When the film opens, the Conners are putting the finishing touches on conning Dean (Ray Liotta), an auto-body shop owner. When the dust from that scam clears, Page announces she's ready to move away from her mother and set up shop on her own -- but in order to clear an outstanding debt, Max insists they bankrupt one more bachelor together.

Only two things stand in their way: Tensy's Teutonic caretaker Miss Madress (Nora Dunn) and beachfront bartender Jack (Jason Lee), a wry stargazer with whom Page becomes unexpectedly smitten.

    <title lang="en">The Mexican</title>
    <desc lang="en">A clumsy criminal is put in a position where he not only has to save his own skin, but that of his girlfriend in this comedy with strong undercurrents of romance. Jerry Welbach (Brad Pitt) is a low-level Mafia "mechanic" whose ineptitude is countered by frequent (but unpredictable) bursts of dumb luck. Jerry's girlfriend Samantha (Julia Roberts) wants him to get out of the business, and after his latest blunder lands capo Arnold Margolese (Gene Hackman) in jail, so does mid-level crime kingpin Bernie Nayman (Bob Balaban). But Bernie insists that Jerry do one last errand for the mob before they let him find employment elsewhere -- he has to go to Mexico and recover a rare and very valuable pistol, which is said to be cursed. While Samantha objects to Jerry taking the assignment, he isn't in much of a position to argue; Jerry heads south of the border, while Samantha, in a huff, sets out for Las Vegas. Once in Mexico, Jerry finds the pistol easily enough, but making his way back to the States proves to be an unexpected challenge. Meanwhile, Jerry's superiors want insurance that he'll return with the goods, so they hire Leroy (James Gandolfini), a hitman, to kidnap Samantha and hold her hostage until Jerry comes back. However, Samantha and Leroy quickly strike up a friendship, and she soon learns the gunman has a sensitive side he doesn't show to the world -- along with a few other secrets. The Mexican marked the first screen pairing for mega-stars Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt -- though, given the film's narrative arc, they play only a handful of scenes together. The film was directed by Gore Verbinski, who won awards for his work in commercials before breaking through with the quirky family comedy Mouse Hunt(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Heartbreakers</title>
    <desc lang="en">After the little white lies of Romy and Michele's High School Reunion (1997), director David Mirkin focuses on scheming of a different sort in Heartbreakers. Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt play Max and Page Conners, a mother and daughter who share everything with each other: relationship advice, hair and makeup hints, and the money they win in costly divorce settlements with rich men. When the film opens, the Conners are putting the finishing touches on conning Dean (Ray Liotta), an auto-body shop owner. When the dust from that scam clears, Page announces she's ready to move away from her mother and set up shop on her own -- but in order to clear an outstanding debt, Max insists they bankrupt one more bachelor together. They settle upon phlegmatic Palm Springs widower William B. Tensy (Gene Hackman), a chain smoker with a heart of gold and a similarly bountiful bank account. Only two things stand in their way: Tensy's Teutonic caretaker Miss Madress (Nora Dunn) and beachfront bartender Jack (Jason Lee), a wry stargazer with whom Page becomes unexpectedly smitten. Heartbreakers is the third collaboration from writers Steven Mazur and Paul Guy, whose previous screwball comedy was 1997's international hit, Liar Liar(n)</desc>

Once cleared of involvement in the case, Poe is invited to help Detective Fields track down the murderer.

    <title lang="en">Scoop</title>
    <desc lang="en">Both laughs and thrills are on the masthead in this comedy drama about a would-be reporter written and directed by Woody Allen. Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson) is an American journalism student who travels to England to visit friends. While in London, she attends a magic show where magician Sid "Splendini" Waterman (Woody Allen) brings her on-stage as part of a trick in which he makes her disappear. However, while waiting to be "de-materialized," she's visited by the ghost of a murdered reporter (Ian McShane), who passes along the scoop of the decade. The spirit claims that Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman), the wealthy and handsome son of a well-known aristocrat, is leading a double life as "the Tarot Card Killer," a serial murderer who has been terrifying the nation and eluding police. With the magician's help, Jane begins investigating the story and is able to piece together some incriminating evidence against Lyman. However, the more she learns, the more dangerous her investigation becomes -- especially when she falls into a romance with the suspected killer. Scoop was Woody Allen's second consecutive film with leading lady Scarlett Johansson, after the critically acclaimed Match Point; it was also Allen's second feature to be shot in Great Britain(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Chicago</title>
    <desc lang="en">A starry-eyed would-be star discovers just how far the notion that "there's no such thing as bad publicity" can go in this screen adaptation of the hit Broadway musical +Chicago, originally directed and choreographed by Bob Fosse. In the mid-'20s, Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) is a small-time chorus dancer married to a well-meaning dunderhead named Amos (John C. Reilly). Roxie is having an affair on the side with Fred Casley (Dominic West), a smooth talker who insists he can make her a star. However, Fred strings Roxie along a bit too far for his own good, and when she realizes that his promises are empty, she becomes enraged and murders Fred in cold blood. Roxie soon finds herself behind bars alongside Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a sexy vaudeville star who used to perform with her sister until Velma discovered that her sister had been sleeping with her husband. Velma shot them both dead, and, after scheming prison matron "Mama" Morton hooks Velma up with hotshot lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), Velma becomes the new Queen of the scandal sheets. Roxie is just shrewd enough to realize that her poor fortune could also bring her fame, so she convinces Amos to also hire Flynn. Soon Flynn is splashing Roxie's story -- or, more accurately, a highly melodramatic revision of Roxie's story -- all over the gutter press, and Roxy and Velma are soon battling neck-to-neck over who can win greater fame through the headlines. A project that had been moving from studio to studio since the musical opened on Broadway in 1973, Chicago also features guest appearances by Lucy Liu and Christine Baranski(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Hugh Grant plays child psychiatrist Samuel Faulkner who, ironically, can't stand children. So when long-standing girlfriend Rebecca Taylor announces she's pregnant, he's less than thrilled and eventually, fed-up with his moaning, she moves out to stay with friends Marty and Gail Dwyer. This being a Chris Columbus film, it all ends happily but not without a lot of fun along the way, particularly from Robin Williams as Russian obstetrician Dr Kosevich who is not just prone to malapropisms, but hasn't actually delivered a baby before(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">When a powerful man is accused of murder, who tells the truth -- the man, or his estranged wife? Henry Hearst (Gene Hackman), an American attorney living in Puerto Rico, is called in to speak with police detective Victor Benezet (Morgan Freeman). A few days earlier, Hearst reported finding the body of a 12-year-old girl while taking his dog for a walk; however, investigators now believe that Hearst may have had a greater involvement in the crime than he's admitting. Under intense questioning by a confident young cop named Owens (Thomas Jane) and gentler but firm interrogation from Benezet, several cracks begin to appear in Hearst's story, but he's able to persuade the police to allow him to leave long enough to take part in a fund-raising function he'd promised to attend. However, upon his return, Hearst discovers that Benezet and Owens have been questioning someone else -- his wife Chantal (Monica Bellucci), who has been on poor terms with her husband for some time. Under Suspicion was based on the novel Brainwash by John Wainwright, which was previously filmed by French director Claude Miller as Garde a vue(n)</desc>

Fleeing to the East, where he seeks counsel with the dangerous but honourable ninja cult leader known as Ra's Al-Ghul, Bruce returns to his now decaying Gotham City, which is overrun by organised crime and other dangerous individuals manipulating the system. Meanwhile, Bruce is slowly being swindled out of Wayne Industries, the company he inherited. The discovery of a cave under his mansion, along with a prototype armoured suit, leads him to assume a new persona, one which will strike fear into the hearts of men who do wrong; he becomes Batman!!!(n)</desc>
