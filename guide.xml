    <title lang="en">The Royal House of Windsor</title>
    <desc lang="en">The royal documentary continues, charting the drama and intrigue of Prince Charles' love-life via intimate letters. In the 1970s, the Prince of Wales resolved to avoid repeating the mistakes of his great uncle, King Edward VIII, and sought advice on marriage from another great uncle - Lord Mountbatten. Taking the heir apparent under his wing, Mountbatten fashioned himself as kingmaker, and arranged a secret meeting in Paris, allowing Charles to meet his disgraced `Uncle David' in person. The prince developed a sympathetic view of the exiled king, and his example fails to stop Charles falling in love with an unsuitable woman, who ends up marrying one of her many past boyfriends. Returning to his first love, Camilla Parker Bowles - now a mother of two - stability continues to elude Charles, until pressure from all sides prompts him to turn his eye to Lady Diana Spencer.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Thirteen</title>
    <desc lang="en">Prolific production designer and art director Catherine Hardwicke makes her directorial debut with the coming-of-age drama Thirteen. Los Angeles teenager and overachiever Tracy (Evan Rachel Wood) is an excellent student in her seventh grade class and gets along well with her mother, Melanie (Holly Hunter). She fears that she's not cool enough to be friends with Evie (Nikki Reed), the most popular girl in school. Fueled with genuine adolescent energy, Tracy follows Evie's lead into the harsh realities of sex, drugs, and hard-edged adventure. Consumed with temptations and conflicting desires, Tracy loses her good-girl identity, greatly affecting her relationship with her mom. Partly autobiographical, Thirteen was co-written by Hardwicke and actual 13-year-old Reed, who are close family friends. Originally intending to write a teen comedy, they ended up creating a hard-hitting drama exposing the contemporary teenage experience. Thirteen was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival, with Catherine Hardwicke taking home the Director's Award(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Stick It</title>
    <desc lang="en">A cocky teenager learns some important lessons about playing by her own rules in this comedy drama. Haley Graham (Missy Peregrym) is a gifted 17-year-old gymnast with a strong rebellious streak -- strong enough that she walked away from her teammates on the eve of a major international tournament because she'd had enough of the rigid regimentation of Team U.S.A. After experiencing a scrape with the law with her extreme-cycling friends, Haley is given an unusual sentence -- attending the Vickerman Gymnastics Academy, a world-class training facility run by Burt Vickerman (Jeff Bridges), who has led some of the world's greatest gymnasts to championship status. Haley makes no secret of her dislike of life at Vickerman's, and her fellow athletes aren't about to forgive her just yet for letting down her teammates. But while Vickerman makes clear things are to be done his way, he respects Haley's talent, and together she shows him and her new teammates how to follow the rules while still expressing your individuality. Also starring Tarah Paige and Vanessa Lengies, Stick It was the first directorial credit for Jessica Bendinger, who wrote the critically praised teen comedy Bring It On(n)</desc>

Twenty thousand years ago, the Earth is overrun by freezing temperatures in an Ice Age that is sending all manner of critters scattering in the path of encroaching glaciers. When a lost human infant is discovered, an unlikely quartet of misfits forms to return it to its mother: Manny, a depressed woolly mammoth (Ray Romano); Sid, a fast-talking sloth (John Leguizamo); an acorn-crazed squirrel named Scrat (Wedge); and the devilish saber-toothed tiger named Diego (Denis Leary). Before they can complete their mission, the reluctant compatriots will brave pits of boiling lava, dangerous caverns of ice, and even a traitorous plot within their midst. Ice Age (2002) also features the voices of Jack Black, Jane Krakowski, and Goran Visnjic(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Wild About Animals</title>
    <desc lang="en">One of the first projects of syndicated TV producer Steve Rotfield, the weekly half-hour Wild About Animals was hosted by actress Mariette Hartley. The series cast its spotlight on rare animals, unique to specific regions of the United States. Regular weekly features included "K9 Cops and Animal Heroes," "Celebrity Owners," and "Animal Bloopers." First telecast in the fall of 1995, Wild About Animals was still flourishing at the end of the 20th century, by which time it was being shown in tandem with two other Rotfield efforts, The Lighter Side of Sports and Awesome Adventures, in most local markets(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Gladiator</title>
    <desc lang="en">A man robbed of his name and his dignity strives to win them back, and gain the freedom of his people, in this epic historical drama from director Ridley Scott. In the year 180, the death of emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) throws the Roman Empire into chaos. Maximus (Russell Crowe) is one of the Roman army's most capable and trusted generals and a key advisor to the emperor. As Marcus' devious son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) ascends to the throne, Maximus is set to be executed. He escapes, but is captured by slave traders. Renamed Spaniard and forced to become a gladiator, Maximus must battle to the death with other men for the amusement of paying audiences. His battle skills serve him well, and he becomes one of the most famous and admired men to fight in the Colosseum. Determined to avenge himself against the man who took away his freedom and laid waste to his family, Maximus believes that he can use his fame and skill in the ring to avenge the loss of his family and former glory. As the gladiator begins to challenge his rule, Commodus decides to put his own fighting mettle to the test by squaring off with Maximus in a battle to the death. Gladiator also features Derek Jacobi, Connie Nielsen, Djimon Hounsou, and Oliver Reed, who died of a heart attack midway through production(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Gladiator</title>
    <desc lang="en">A man robbed of his name and his dignity strives to win them back, and gain the freedom of his people, in this epic historical drama from director Ridley Scott. In the year 180, the death of emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) throws the Roman Empire into chaos. Maximus (Russell Crowe) is one of the Roman army's most capable and trusted generals and a key advisor to the emperor. As Marcus' devious son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) ascends to the throne, Maximus is set to be executed. He escapes, but is captured by slave traders. Renamed Spaniard and forced to become a gladiator, Maximus must battle to the death with other men for the amusement of paying audiences. His battle skills serve him well, and he becomes one of the most famous and admired men to fight in the Colosseum. Determined to avenge himself against the man who took away his freedom and laid waste to his family, Maximus believes that he can use his fame and skill in the ring to avenge the loss of his family and former glory. As the gladiator begins to challenge his rule, Commodus decides to put his own fighting mettle to the test by squaring off with Maximus in a battle to the death. Gladiator also features Derek Jacobi, Connie Nielsen, Djimon Hounsou, and Oliver Reed, who died of a heart attack midway through production(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Matrix</title>
    <desc lang="en">What if virtual reality wasn't just for fun, but was being used to imprison you? That's the dilemma that faces mild-mannered computer jockey Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) in The Matrix. It's the year 1999, and Anderson (hacker alias: Neo) works in a cubicle, manning a computer and doing a little hacking on the side. It's through this latter activity that Thomas makes the acquaintance of Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), who has some interesting news for Mr. Anderson -- none of what's going on around him is real. The year is actually closer to 2199, and it seems Thomas, like most people, is a victim of The Matrix, a massive artificial intelligence system that has tapped into people's minds and created the illusion of a real world, while using their brains and bodies for energy, tossing them away like spent batteries when they're through. Morpheus, however, is convinced Neo is "The One" who can crack open The Matrix and bring his people to both physical and psychological freedom. The Matrix is the second feature film from the sibling writer/director team of Andy Wachowski and Larry Wachowski, who made an impressive debut with the stylish erotic crime thriller Bound(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Ron Perlman returns to the role of the big red BPRD agent in this sequel to 2004's Hellboy, directed once again by Guillermo del Toro and scripted as before in collaboration with original Hellboy creator Mike Mignola. For centuries, an ancient truce has kept the naïve citizens of the human race safe from the horrors of the invisible realm -- but that's all about to change, and fast. A ruthless leader has emerged in the invisible realm, a tyrant just as comfortable walking the surface realm as he is living in the land of fantasy. When this power-mad ruler defies his bloodline to assemble an unstoppable army of fantastical creatures that he will use to wage a supernatural war on humanity, it begins to appear that humankind's days are numbered. But Hellboy (Perlman) isn't about to stand idly by as the planet is purged by a demonic despot, and with a little help from his team at the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense, he may just be able to send our otherworldly overlords packing. Of course, Hellboy's pyrokinetic girlfriend, Liz (Selma Blair), is always willing to conjure up an inferno or two when things get desperate, aquatic Abe (Doug Jones) is prepared to dive headlong into any battle, and protoplasmic mystic Johann (voice of Thomas Kretschmann) proves an invaluable companion in times of inter-dimensional conflict. Now, as the creatures who inhabit the spiritual realm gear up for an all-out attack on the human plane, the only one capable of saving the Earth is a tough-talking hellspawn rejected by both worlds(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Scotland v Italy.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Scotland v Italy (Kick-off 12.30pm). Gabby Logan presents coverage of the opening match on the final day of the championship, which takes place at Murrayfield. Italy have yet to pick up a single point in the championship despite occasional signs of improvement under coach Conor O'Shea, although much of the focus will be on Scotland coach Vern Cotter as he takes charge for the final time. The New Zealander will be replaced by Gregor Townsend in June and will be looking to end his reign in style following an encouraging campaign, although he could be without several key players following their thrashing at the hands of England last weekend.

    <desc lang="en">Katie Derham makes use of archive footage and family records to tell the story of how Vera Lynn came to become one of the UK's most well-known musical stars. Vera celebrates her 100th birthday on March 20th, and marks the occasion by reminiscing about her early days in showbusiness, with help from her daughter Virginia. She recalls starting out as Vera Welch in the 1920s, first appearing on stage at the tender age of seven, before charming the nation's servicemen and becoming the `forces sweetheart' during the Second World War. She also remembers becoming the first British artist to achieve a number one in America in the 1950s, and a similar feat in 2009, when she became the oldest living singer to reach the same position in the UK charts. Along the way, Second World War veterans and entertainment industry figures - including Paul McCartney, Barry Humphries and Miriam Margolyes - pay tribute to the power of her voice.(n)</desc>

Ultimately, the mother and daughter are able to relocate to an apartment, which, despite its excessively dilapidated interior, seems to be an adequate location for beginning a new life.

No stranger to mental illness, the wary young woman brushes the visions aside as part of the inherent stress of making the transition from housewife to working, single mom. As time goes by and the apparent haunting does not subside, the apartment's new residents are forced to examine the history of its former tenants. Dark Water also features performances from John C.

Japan's leaders believed that if they could inflict sufficient casualties on enemy forces, the Allies would give up, and American president Harry S Truman realised that there was only one way to force this fanatical enemy into surrendering, and decided to deploy the atomic bomb.(n)</desc>

In the west, Allied forces were within striking distance of the Rhine, while Red Army soldiers in the east were at the banks of the river Oder, just an hour's drive from Berlin. As the Allies advanced, they uncovered horrific evidence of Hitler's `final solution' - concentration camps filled with starving prisoners, piles of corpses and the gas chambers that the Germans had not had time to obliterate. The final battle for Berlin began on April 16 and nine days later the city was surrounded, with Soviet troops eliminating the remaining resistance.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Andy Tennant's romantic comedy fantasy is set in 16th-century France, where, following the death of her father, Danielle De Barbarac is assigned kitchen duties in the castle by her stepmother Baroness Rodmilla de Ghent. A chance meeting with Prince Henry, heir apparent to the throne, leads to the potential for a romance that she fears could be ruined if he discovers the masquerade. A "fairy godmother" in the shape of Leonardo da Vinci eventually smoothes the path of true love but, thanks to Barrymore, this is not another soft retelling of Cinderella but a punchy, energetic film with Barrymore in excellent form as the forthright Danielle(n)</desc>

On July 18, 1863, on a stretch of beach near Charleston, South Carolina, the 54th Regiment of Massachesetts Volunteer Infantry began its bloody assault on a nearly impregnable Confederate fort. The black enlisted men were fighting not just for victory but for respect and freedom. Their heroic actions undermined Northern opposition to having blacks in arms and helped throw open the gates of the Union Army to 180,000 blacks who, by risking their own lives in the war, laid claim to emancipation and citizenship for themselves and their children(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Dr. Wai: The Scripture With No Words</title>
    <desc lang="en">This comedy is quite a change for Hong Kong martial arts hero Jet Li. Li plays Chow, the writer of a pulp-style adventure serial, who seems to be failing in both his career and his marriage to Monica (Rosamund Kwan). The film also enacts out Chow's story as he writes it: Li also plays the fictional Dr. Wai, a daring adventurer in the tradition of Doc Savage or Indiana Jones. As Chow tries to churn out his story, Dr. Wai pursues a mysterious scroll called "The Scripture Without Words"; the film's transitions between reality and fantasy is reminiscent of films such as Brazil and The Princess Bride(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Dawn of the Planet of the Apes</title>
    <desc lang="en">A war begins to brew between man and ape in this sequel to the 2011 hit Rise of the Planet of the Apes. It's been ten years since the Simian Flu wiped out most of humanity, and somewhere deep in the woods outside of San Francisco, Caesar (voice and performance capture by Andy Serkis) and his primate companions have established a thriving village built on the principles of peace and community. Shortly after welcoming a baby brother into the family, Caesar's son Blue Eyes (Nick Thurston) is walking through the forest with his friend Ash (Doc Shaw) when they cross paths with a human named Carver (Kirk Acevedo), who impulsively draws his gun and shoots Ash at the first sign of aggression. As it turns out, Carver is part of a human expedition led by Malcolm (Jason Clarke), who, along with the rest of his crew, races to Carver's side just as Caesar and the rest of the apes answer Blue Eyes' desperate call for help. An enraged Caesar drives the humans away after realizing they are no longer a threat, and decides to dispatch a small crew to follow them rather than yield to the pleas of his aggressive advisor Koba (Toby Kebbell) to launch an all-out attack. Instead, he decides to show the apes' strength by amassing outside of the humans' makeshift community at the base of an unfinished tower, making it unmistakably clear that the two species should remain apart. Meanwhile, the point of the human excursion was to get a dormant dam running again in order to power their community, which will soon be thrust into darkness should they fail to take action. Convinced that he could strike a truce with Caesar that would allow the humans to repair the dam, which is located on the apes' land, Malcolm gets permission from human leader Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) to set out on his mission. Incredibly, thanks to the help of his girlfriend Ellie (Keri Russell), his son Alexander (Kodi Smit-McPhee), and a few other key allies, Malcolm succeeds. Still, his truce with the apes is a fragile one, and just when it seems that the primates and humans have learned to coexist in peace, a shocking act of betrayal threatens to spark a war that will determine the dominant species(n)</desc>

Convenience-store magnate Apu Nahasapeemapetilon (voice of Hank Azaria) is drafted at the last minute into participating in a charity bachelor auction, and makes a surprising impression on the single women in attendance. Apu suddenly finds he's Springfield's most eligible bachelor, and is enjoying the attention until he is contacted by his mother (voice of Andrea Martin), who reminds him that's he's pledged to marry a girl named Manjula (voice of Jan Hooks) in a marriage that was arranged when he was a boy. Apu foolishly asks Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) for advice, and he suggests Apu tell his mother he's already married. Apu thinks he's off the hook until his mom appears at the Kwik-E-Mart, wanting to meet her daughter-in-law. Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) finds herself pretending to be Apu's wife as Homer hides out with his father at the Springfield Retirement Castle, where he finds assisted living agrees with him. But Mother eventually catches on that Apu is still single, and he's forced with great reluctance to marry a woman he hasn't seen in decades. "The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons" first aired on November 16, 1997(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">After seven weeks of tough competition, the four remaining hopefuls enter the last week - three consecutive nights of culinary challenges after which one of them will be crowned MasterChef Champion. To begin, the finalists are sent to the Holborn Dining Room, where they are tasked to prepare one course each of a three-course meal, designed by Tom Kerridge, and judged by five chefs with nine Michelin stars between them - Ashley Palmer-Watts, Michael Caines, Nathan Outlaw, Simon Rogan and Tom Kitchin. This is the amateurs' chance to show the best of the best that they have what it takes to one day join their ranks. Back in the studio, they face an invention test based around the humble chicken, and with one cook leaving at the end of the show, all four will be desperate to impress.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Marley &amp; Me</title>
    <desc lang="en">The Devil Wears Prada director David Frankel's light comedy/ drama - based on a best-selling autobiography - stars Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston as a pair of married journalists who welcome a truly unruly dog into their lives. Relocating to Florida, newlyweds John and Jenny Grogan end up working for rival newspapers, and it's soon obvious that Jenny has landed the more high-profile job. But when she starts to become broody, one of John's colleagues suggests they see how they cope with a puppy before trying for a baby. John duly picks a cute yellow Labrador Retriever as a gift for his spouse. It's quickly clear their acquisition is something of a double-edged sword: he's an untrainably anarchic source of destruction; but he also gives John the material for a wry newspaper column, which greatly increases his standing (and the paper's readership). The film follows the trajectory of the Grogans' marriage, through good times and bad, and the stuff of everyday life, with the dog providing comic relief and the leads turning in convincing, heart-warming performances(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A cop and a killer forge a shaky partnership to find out who killed their partners in this throwback buddy action flick starring Sylvester Stallone, and directed by vet Walter Hill. Battle-scarred New Orleans hitman James Bonomo (Stallone) and his longtime partner Louis (Jon Seda) have just executed their latest hit, a cop named Hank Greely (Holt McCallany) when Louis is killed by hulking enforcer Keegan (Jason Momoa) before they can get paid. In the wake of a failed attempt on Bonomo's life as well, Keegan flees the scene, but not before his intended target gets a good look at his face. Meanwhile, Korean NYPD cop Taylor Kwon (Sung Kang) shows up in town determined to find out who killed Greely, his former partner. When Kwon tracks Bonomo down to find out who hired him, both realize that their best hope for catching their respective partners' killers is to team up. Before long, their trail of clues has led them to sleazy lawyer Marcus Baptiste (Christian Slater), who is currently caught up in some shady business dealings with the mysterious and powerful Robert Nkomo Morel (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) that could implicate some serious power players in Washington, D.C. Now each new move that Bonomo and Kwon make could be their last, and as the cop does his best to stay on the right side of the law, the killer uses the only tactics he knows to get results. But even if they manage to get their man, that doesn't change the fact that they'll have to deal with one another once they've taken down their target(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Devil Wears Prada director David Frankel's light comedy/ drama - based on a best-selling autobiography - stars Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston as a pair of married journalists who welcome a truly unruly dog into their lives. Relocating to Florida, newlyweds John and Jenny Grogan end up working for rival newspapers, and it's soon obvious that Jenny has landed the more high-profile job. But when she starts to become broody, one of John's colleagues suggests they see how they cope with a puppy before trying for a baby. John duly picks a cute yellow Labrador Retriever as a gift for his spouse. It's quickly clear their acquisition is something of a double-edged sword: he's an untrainably anarchic source of destruction; but he also gives John the material for a wry newspaper column, which greatly increases his standing (and the paper's readership). The film follows the trajectory of the Grogans' marriage, through good times and bad, and the stuff of everyday life, with the dog providing comic relief and the leads turning in convincing, heart-warming performances(n)</desc>

Austin), race to find a home for their loyal dog Friday. Fortunately for Friday, there's an abandoned hotel just around the corner, and Bruce possesses just the kind of mechanical smarts needed to transform the rundown inn into a four-star retreat for canines. For a while, Friday and his friends have it made, but when the neighbors start to get suspicious, Andi and Bruce resort to every trick in the book in order to prevent their secret from being discovered.

    <title lang="en">Dave Chappelle's Block Party</title>
    <desc lang="en">In September 2004, comedian Dave Chappelle took a break from his immensely successful Comedy Central show to stage a free, unpublicized, all-star hip-hop concert in the Clinton Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn, NY. Inviting fans over the Internet, on the street, and even in his family's hometown of Yellow Springs, OH, Chappelle asked filmmaker Michel Gondry to document the event from its inception on through to the performances themselves. The result is Dave Chappelle's Block Party, a concert film that provides not only a sampling of the music on display that September, but also an intimate look at the comedian himself. Gondry's cameras tag along with Chappelle as he visits Ohio, recruits a university marching band to play at the show, and surveys the opinions of Clinton Hill on the show that's about to take place. Along the way, we're introduced to some the comedian's favorite acts, in rehearsals and on-stage: Dead Prez, Jill Scott, Mos Def, the Roots, Erykah Badu, Kanye West, and the surprise reuniting of the Fugees(n)</desc>

McGinley) assigns Cross and his team to the case, and they soon find themselves playing a cat and mouse game with a nameless psychotic (Matthew Fox) with a taste for torture and a grudge against some of the Motor City's wealthiest citizens. Clues point to French financier Leon Mercier (Jean Reno) as the killer's ultimate victim, but Cross and his team suspect Mercier has a secret he isn't willing to share, and the case becomes a personal obsession for Cross when the maniac first kills Monica and then Maria. Also starring Giancarlo Esposito and Cicely Tyson, Alex Cross marked Tyler Perry's debut as an action hero, playing the protagonist of James Patterson's series of best-selling crime novels; Cross was previously played on screen by Morgan Freeman in the films Kiss The Girls and Along Came A Spider(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Live Six Nations Rugby Union</title>
    <sub-title lang="en">Ireland v England.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Ireland v England (Kick-off 5.00pm). Mark Pougatch presents coverage of the final match of the championship, which takes place at the Aviva Stadium. This fixture was always expected to be key when the schedule was announced, but Ireland's defeat to Wales last time out ended their chances of winning the title and handed England the spoils. However, finishing top will not be regarded as enough for coach Eddie Jones as his men seek to win the Grand Slam for the second year in succession, and the first in Six Nations history. The visitors have held the upper hand in recent meetings, winning on six of the last seven occasions, but that solitary defeat came on their last visit to Dublin in 2015. With analysis from Clive Woodward, Jonny Wilkinson and Brian O'Driscoll, pitchside reports from Martin Bayfield and Maggie Alphonsi, and commentary by Nick Mullins, Lawrence Dallaglio and Gordon D'Arcy.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Richard III: The New Evidence</title>
    <desc lang="en">Since the discovery of Richard III's remains under a car park in Leicester, scientists have been subjecting the 15th-century English king's skeleton to intense scrutiny and analysis, allowing them to reassemble his life in detail. Using the latest techniques, experts have been able to define the extent to which his spinal deformity would have affected his ability to be the warrior famed for leading the charge at the Battle of Bosworth. They have also pieced together his diet and revealed his lifestyle in his final years, with surprising results. The scientists have been helped in their investigations by a body double, 27-year-old Dominic Smee, who has the same form of scoliosis as Richard III, and this programme follows their findings.(n)</desc>

Chicago, Illinois: Built in 1925, and aging badly, Stateville Correctional is a dangerous place filled with dangerous men, nearly all serving 20 years minimum. Half are in for murder and another quarter are serving time for violent crimes. For many, the thing that makes life bearable are family, loved ones, girl friends and friends in general but its a struggle. Simkatyah Winfield is a drug dealer doing 60 years for murder but he's also a devoted dad. Yet how can he really act as a good parent behind bars, especially now that his 17-year-old daughter is pregnant? Some inmates look beyond the gates of the prison to sustain them. Other inmates are trying just to be themselves behind bars, without getting punished for it. Guiding us through Stateville is veteran of 16 years, Sgt. Baldwin who expresses the importance of the outside world to inmates and how it keeps them sane. It turns out family, romance, and friendship are the things that make life go around, even among the worst of the worst(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Notorious Metro City villian Megamind (voice of Will Ferrell) becomes an unlikely savior to the troubled metropolis after defeating beloved do-gooder Metro Man (voice of Brad Pitt) and creating a new opponent who refuses to play by the rules. Megamind was only an infant when his parents loaded him into an emergency escape pod and jettisoned him into space just as their planet was being sucked into a black hole. His destination: planet Earth. Meanwhile, another slightly more wholesome baby sets out on the same trajectory. But while the latter will ultimately land in the home of a wealthy couple and grow up to become Metro Man, hero of Metro City, poor Megamind finds his fate taking the opposite course when his pod crashes in a prison yard, leaving him to be raised by convicts. Later, in grade school, the kids all flock to Metro Man, leaving a frustrated Megamind to embrace a life of diabolical misdeeds. As the years go by, Metro Man and Megamind develop an intense adversarial relationship that pits them in battle over Metro City time and again. Undeterred by his unbroken losing streak, Megamind hatches an ingenious scheme to finally destroy Metro Man by kidnapping pretty reporter Roxanne Ritchi (voice of Tina Fey), and luring the predictable hero into a deadly trap. Then something unexpected happens -- Megamind's plan actually works. Now, with Metro Man out of the picture, Megamind and his Minion (voice of David Cross) stake their claim on Metro City. But what good is ultimate power when you don't even have to fight for it? Realizing that life is simply out of balance without Metro Man to be the hero, Megamind creates a new foe who will be just as righteous and powerful as his fallen adversary. Unfortunately, Megamind's schemes usually have a way of backfiring, and when Metro City's newest savior proves even more evil than Megamind, the blue-hued antihero prepares to fight back with everything he's got(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The One with Two Parts. This episode marks the first appearance of Phoebe's (Lisa Kudrow) twin sister, Ursula (also played by Kudrow), who is the exact opposite of the considerate and peace-loving Phoebe. Joey starts to date Ursula, which annoys Phoebe because she doesn't get along with her sister. Meanwhile, Ross (David Schwimmer) attends Lamaze class with Susan (Jessica Hecht) and Carol (Jane Sibbett). As Carol voices her anxiety about going through with the pregnancy, Ross also begins to come to terms with his role as a father; much humor is made over who gets to play the father role in the class exercises. Across town, Chandler (Matthew Perry) is dating Nina (Jennifer Grant), an employee he cannot bring himself to fire -- instead, he tells the other office workers that she is insane and too imbalanced to let go. When Nina asks why her co-workers are avoiding her, Chandler says that perhaps they are jealous of their relationship. After Marcel, Ross' monkey, changes Monica's (Courteney Cox) TV to Spanish mode, the gang sits around and watches it. This leads Joey to make the astute observation that "Urkel" is spelled the same way in Spanish as it is in English. Helen Hunt and Leila Kenzle show up at Central Perk as Jamie and Fran, their characters from Mad About You. This episode is part one of a two-part episode that originally aired on February 23, 1995(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Scotland v Italy (Kick-off 12.30pm). Coverage of the opening match on the final day of the championship, which takes place at Murrayfield. Italy have yet to pick up a single point in the championship despite occasional signs of improvement under coach Conor O'Shea, although much of the focus will be on Scotland coach Vern Cotter as he takes charge for the final time. The New Zealander will be replaced by Gregor Townsend in June and will be looking to end his reign in style following an encouraging campaign, although he could be without several key players following their thrashing at the hands of England last weekend. Presented by Daire O'Brien, with analysis from Brent Pope, Eddie O'Sullivan and Shane Horgan, and commentary by George Hamilton and John Beattie.(n)</desc>

Wales have an excellent recent record against France, but the outcome of this match is hard to predict, with the hosts showing signs of improvement under Guy Noves despite narrow losses to England and Ireland, while Wales have performed well below the standards set in recent years. Both sides have won two and lost two of their matches and could finish anywhere between second and fifth in the standings.

    <sub-title lang="en">Ireland v England.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Ireland v England (Kick-off 5.00pm). Coverage of the final match of the championship, which takes place at the Aviva Stadium. This fixture was always expected to be key when the schedule was announced, but Ireland's defeat to Wales last time out ended their chances of winning the title and handed England the spoils. However, finishing top will not be regarded as enough for coach Eddie Jones as his men seek to win the Grand Slam for the second year in succession, and the first in Six Nations history. The visitors have held the upper hand in recent meetings, winning on six of the last seven occasions, but that solitary defeat came on their last visit to Dublin in 2015.

An alert warns officers to look out for a car involved in an armed robbery, and when two traffic cops spot the vehicle, they take up the surveillance trail. A driver's insurance policy seems in order - until a hunch and a fingerprint detector prove otherwise - and a woman is lucky to be alive when she overturns her car while checking her mobile.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">David Attenborough's Conquest of the Skies</title>
    <sub-title lang="en">First to Fly.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The veteran naturalist examines the world of flight, travelling across the globe to chart the evolutionary story of those creatures who seemingly defy the rules of gravity by taking to the air. Initially focusing on insects, Attenborough meets a descendant of the dragonfly, before examining the Atlas beetle, which tends to restrict flight to times when it needs a mate or a fresh supply of food. More aesthetically pleasing is a group of beautiful tropical butterflies, followed by an in-depth study into the blow fly - the jet fighter of insects.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Thing</title>
    <desc lang="en">A mysterious shape-shifting alien kills and impersonates its victims on an Antarctic research base manned by a crew of American scientists. The researchers face the ordeal of stopping the creature from making its way to civilisation - but are in danger of jeopardising the task as mounting paranoia turns them against each other. John Carpenter's sci-fi horror remake, starring Kurt Russell, Wilford Brimley, TK Carter, Keith David and Richard Dysart.(n)</desc>

With no end to the strike in sight, the urban activists venture into the countryside to deliver their donation in person, and find they have more in common with the people of this struggling community than anyone on either side could have expected.

Each have their different reasons for setting out into the unknown.

Based on Michael Crichton's bestseller, Marshall's film is great fun, with wonderful cliff-hanging moments and, in Linney's character, one who can out-tough Indiana Jones any day(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Hurt Locker</title>
    <desc lang="en">Kathryn Bigelow's multiple-Oscar-winning film is a compelling fact-based, Iraq-set bomb disposal drama, scripted by journalist Mark Boal, drawing on his experiences while embedded with a United States Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal team in 2004. The focus is on the complex characters making up Bravo Company, who disable and destroy improvised explosive devices. The days are ticking down to the end of the bomb squad's tour, but their role puts the team in harm's way around the clock. And it doesn't help that one of the team is addicted to risk taking and pays scant attention to standard procedure, putting other lives in danger, as well as his own. The Hurt Locker provides a tense glimpse into the lives of these extraordinary men, and also probes the various psychologies of people whose job could kill them at any moment, as well as - briefly - exploring how they cope once away from their adrenaline-soaked vocation. Also starring Anthony Mackie, Ralph Fiennes, Guy Pearce, Brian Geraghty and Evangeline Lilly(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Zombie Honeymoon</title>
    <desc lang="en">A young bride says "until death do us part," but finds that doesn't necessarily put an end to her romance in this offbeat blend of horror, comedy, and romance. Danny (Graham Sibley) and Denise (Tracy Coogan) are a young couple who have just gotten married and head off to a beachside bungalow to celebrate their honeymoon. While enjoying a sunny afternoon on the beach, Danny and Denise's idyllic getaway takes a turn for the worse when a monster rises from the ocean and attacks Danny. The creature spews poison into Danny's mouth, and soon the new husband is dead. But Danny isn't gone for long -- he unexpectedly regains consciousness, but Denise soon learns that her new mate has become a flesh-eating zombie, and that the former vegetarian now has a taste for human beings. But Danny still has one link with the world of the living -- he loves Denise with all his heart, and struggles to keep his monstrous appetites under control for her sake, while Denise remains deeply in love with Danny, and tries to adjust to the strange and monstrous changes taking place in the man she married. Zombie Honeymoon was written and directed by Dave Gebroe, who was inspired to make the film by his sister, a horror film fan who lost her husband in a surfing accident not long after they were wed(n)</desc>

Peter (Keir Dullea) is a mad-killer who terrorizes the women by making threatening telephone calls. As the body count mounts, the women realize that the killer may be in the house. Black Christmas, one of the first of the slasher pictures, is still frightening despite some plot devices which have now become standard and predictable. Director Bob Clark uses his excellent cast to great effect, and the script, written by Roy Moore, has some great plot twists and a good, scary surprise ending. Black Christmas has also been released as Silent Night, Evil Night and Stranger in the House(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Hurt Locker</title>
    <desc lang="en">Kathryn Bigelow's multiple-Oscar-winning film is a compelling fact-based, Iraq-set bomb disposal drama, scripted by journalist Mark Boal, drawing on his experiences while embedded with a United States Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal team in 2004. The focus is on the complex characters making up Bravo Company, who disable and destroy improvised explosive devices. The days are ticking down to the end of the bomb squad's tour, but their role puts the team in harm's way around the clock. And it doesn't help that one of the team is addicted to risk taking and pays scant attention to standard procedure, putting other lives in danger, as well as his own. The Hurt Locker provides a tense glimpse into the lives of these extraordinary men, and also probes the various psychologies of people whose job could kill them at any moment, as well as - briefly - exploring how they cope once away from their adrenaline-soaked vocation. Also starring Anthony Mackie, Ralph Fiennes, Guy Pearce, Brian Geraghty and Evangeline Lilly(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Reign Of Fire</title>
    <desc lang="en">Medieval fantasy meets futuristic science fiction in this effects-heavy action epic from former X-Files director Rob Bowman. In present-day London, 12-year-old Quinn Abercromby witnesses the awakening of a hibernating dragon from a centuries-long slumber, the result of a construction dig supervised by his mother and an incident for which Quinn feels partially responsible. Twenty years later, the adult Quinn (Christian Bale) is the fire chief of a refortified castle community, responsible for dousing the blazes lit by the dragon's prodigious number of flame-spewing offspring, airborne juggernauts that have wreaked havoc across the globe, torching civilization and turning humans into an endangered species. Hope arrives in the form of Denton "Dragon Slayer" Van Zan (Matthew McConaughey), an American known to be the only man to ever kill one of the dragons, and Alex (Izabella Scorupco), a scientist/pilot who's a member of Van Zan's army, a zealous fighting force that includes a secret weapon: the Archangels, paratroopers using themselves as bait to attract and then dispatch the deadly beasts. Reign of Fire (2002) co-stars Gerard Butler, Alice Krige, and Alexander Siddig(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Reign Of Fire</title>
    <desc lang="en">Medieval fantasy meets futuristic science fiction in this effects-heavy action epic from former X-Files director Rob Bowman. In present-day London, 12-year-old Quinn Abercromby witnesses the awakening of a hibernating dragon from a centuries-long slumber, the result of a construction dig supervised by his mother and an incident for which Quinn feels partially responsible. Twenty years later, the adult Quinn (Christian Bale) is the fire chief of a refortified castle community, responsible for dousing the blazes lit by the dragon's prodigious number of flame-spewing offspring, airborne juggernauts that have wreaked havoc across the globe, torching civilization and turning humans into an endangered species. Hope arrives in the form of Denton "Dragon Slayer" Van Zan (Matthew McConaughey), an American known to be the only man to ever kill one of the dragons, and Alex (Izabella Scorupco), a scientist/pilot who's a member of Van Zan's army, a zealous fighting force that includes a secret weapon: the Archangels, paratroopers using themselves as bait to attract and then dispatch the deadly beasts. Reign of Fire (2002) co-stars Gerard Butler, Alice Krige, and Alexander Siddig(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A woman studying a crime of the past finds her own life becoming a morass of suspicion and deceit in this drama based on the novel by Anita Shreve. Jean Janes (Catherine McCormack) is a photographer working on a project that would document surviving evidence of a multiple murder that occurred a hundred years ago -- when a man named Louis Wagner (Ciaran Hinds) brutally killed two immigrant women from Norway with an axe, only to discover a third, Maren Hontvedt (Sarah Polley), witnessed the mayhem and survived to identify him in court. Jean travels to the small New Hampshire coastal town where the killings occurred with her husband Thomas (Sean Penn), an award-winning poet; his brother Rich (Josh Lucas); and Rich's girlfriend Adaline (Elizabeth Hurley). As Jean digs deeper into the troubling facts of the long-ago murder, as well as the tangential details of Maren Honvedt's unhappy marriage to John Hontvedt (Ulrich Thomsen) and her incestuous affair with her brother Evan (Anders W. Berthelsen), Jean begins to believe that she has a crisis of her own to contend with: she is convinced Thomas is having an affair with Adaline.

    <title lang="en">Ride With the Devil</title>
    <desc lang="en">A complex tale of uneasy alliances and hostilities along the Kansas/Missouri border during the Civil War, Ride with the Devil opens in 1862. The story concerns Jack Bull Chiles (Skeet Ulrich), a proud son of the South ready to fight for the Confederate cause after his father is killed by Yankee troops. Chiles's friend, Jake Roedel (Tobey Maguire), joins the Bushwhackers, a group of renegade Southerners aligned with the Confederate Army, even though his family supports the Union cause - which sets him head-to-head with his father. The two young men, used to the slow pace and gracious lifestyle of the South's privileged class, become guerilla fighters and wander through the countryside together, encountering sudden, shocking and extreme acts of violence. Their comrades include valiant leader Black John (James Caviezel), paranoid madman Pitt (Jonathan Rhys Myers), gentleman George (Simon Baker), and Daniel (Jeffrey Wright), a laconic former slave who unexpectedly fighs for the south despite his race out of sheer loyalty to George - though the others regard him with suspicion. The Bushwhackers hide out in a shed near the home of Sue Lee Shelley (singer/songwriter/poet Jewel), a pregnant widow whose husband was killed three weeks after their marriage. Later, following a shocking and unexpected act of violence, a number of the men team up with the crazed Quantrill (John Ales) to stage an attack on an abolitionist stronghold, but Jake finds his moral conscience growing more acute, and takes the first steps toward romancing and starting a family with Sue Lee in what looks to be a very different post-Civil War future. Adapted from the novel Woe to Live On by Daniel Woodrell, Ride with the Devil was directed by Ang Lee, whose previous project was a very different look at America's past, the 1970s domestic drama The Ice Storm (1997)(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Set in Victorian London, Tanya Wexler's period comedy Hysteria tells the tale of Mortimer Granville (Hugh Dancy), a young doctor disturbed by the way most hospitals ignore the latest research on germ theory, and still treat patients with bleedings and leeches. After being fired from his most recent job for speaking out on the matter, he ends up in the employ of Dr. Robert Dalrymple (Jonathan Pryce) who runs a private practice specializing in treating women who suffer from "hysteria" and come to the doctor for his precise digital manipulations in order to get a release. With the help of Mortimer's best friend Edmund (Rupert Everett) together they create a device that allows these women to achieve the desired result much more quickly. Complicating matters, Mortimer becomes enamored of Dalrymple's strong-willed, feminist-minded daughter Charlotte (Maggie Gyllenhaal). Hysteria played at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Virgin Suicides</title>
    <desc lang="en">A dark comedy punctuated by moments of drama, The Virgin Suicides explores the emotional underpinnings of a family starting to come apart at the seams in 1970's Midwestern America. The Lisbons seem like an ordinary enough family; Father (James Woods) teaches math at a high school in Michigan, Mother (Kathleen Turner) has a strong religious faith, and they have five teenage daughters, ranging from 13-year-old Cecilia (Hannah Hall) to 17-year-old Therese (Leslie Hayman). However, the Lisbon family's sense of normalcy is shattered when Cecilia falls into a deep depression and attempts suicide. The family is shaken and Mother and Father seek the advice of psychiatrist Dr. Hornicker (Danny DeVito), who suggests the girls should be allowed to socialize more with boys. However, boys soon become a serious problem for Cecilia's sister Lux (Kirsten Dunst). Lux has attracted the eye of a high-school Romeo named Trip (Josh Hartnett), who assures Father of his good intentions. But Cecilia finally makes good on her decision to kill herself, throwing the Lisbons into a panic; and after attending a school dance, Trip seduces and then abandons Lux. The Lisbons pull their daughters out of school, as an emotionally frayed Mother keeps close watch over them. Meanwhile, Lux continues to attract the attentions of the local boys, and she responds with a series of clandestine sexual episodes with random partners as often as she can sneak out of the house. The debut feature from Sofia Coppola (whose father, Francis Ford Coppola, co-produced this film), The Virgin Suicides also features supporting performances from Scott Glenn and Giovanni Ribisi. The film was shown as part of the Directors Fortnight series as the 1999 Cannes Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Barry Sonnenfeld directs this kissing cousin of his own 1995 hit Get Shorty, a comic caper adapted by Robert Ramsey and Matthew Stone from the novel by newspaper humorist Dave Barry. When two New Jersey hitmen (Dennis Farina and Jack Kehler) show up in Miami to whack crooked businessman Arthur Herk (Stanley Tucci), they happen to creep into his backyard at the same time as Matt (Ben Foster), a high school kid with his own assassination plans.

The battle between the Avengers and Ultron is further complicated by the appearance of superpowered siblings Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), who ally themselves with the homicidal android.

As South Africa comes to terms with the legacy of apartheid, their government has created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, in which the perpetrators of racial violence and injustice must come face to face with their victims if they are to be forgiven for their crimes. Langston Whitfield (Samuel L. Jackson) is an African-American journalist who is assigned to cover these hearings by The Washington Post; Whitfield doubts the efficacy of this process, and sets out to interview Col. De Jager (Brendan Gleeson), a notorious former officer of the South African police who was famous for his violence against blacks in order to put this method to the test. While in South Africa, Whitfield meets Anna Malan (Juliette Binoche), an Afrikaner poet who is covering the hearing for a radio station and is both appalled and disturbed by the details of the violence inflicted against her countrymen. After striking up a friendship, Whitfield and Malan become romantically involved as they try to come to terms with their feelings about what they've learned. Also screened under the title Country of My Skull, In My Country was adapted from a book by South African author Antjie Krog(n)</desc>

He does a remarkably convincing job, and he soon reveals that he actually believes himself to be Santa Claus. The authorities threaten to place the old man in an insane asylum, but a young lawyer comes to his defense. Meanwhile, Dorey and Susan find their own defenses melting and become reacquainted with the power of faith. Hughes and director Les Mayfield add a few modern touches, making Susan slightly more cynical and adding the requisite soulless corporate villains. Viewers familiar with the original may still prefer Edmund Gwenn's original Kris Kringle and consider the remake unnecessary, although the newer version reflects enough of the earlier film's spirit to prove entertaining to modern family audiences(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Peggy and the Pirates. In this elaborate musical fantasy, Peg (Katey Sagal) dreams that she is Princess Scarlet, the captive of fierce pirate Captain Courage, who bears a striking resemblance to Peg's husband Al (Ed O'Neill). As things develop, Captain Courage emerges the hero of the piece by rescuing Scarlet from rival pirate Rubio the Cruel (played by the Bundys' ex-neighbor Steve Rhoades [David Garrison]), so named for his murderous renditions of popular show tunes. Also appearing in Peg's dream are her children Bud (David Faustino) as hunchbacked first mate Fluvio and Kelly (Christina Applegate) as a very confused navigator, not to mention Peg's neighbors Jefferson D'Arcy (Ted McGinley) as Prince Paco and Marcy Darcy (Amanda Bearse) as a cabin...uh...boy. This episode marks the final appearance of child actor Shane Sweet as Seven (and none too soon, according to the series' fans!)(n)</desc>

Thanks to another one of those computer glitches which breed like rabbits on Married. . .With Children, Al Bundy (Ed O'Neill) is deemed to be 65 years old--and gets a senior discount card as a result.
