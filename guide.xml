Chasing after the White Rabbit, who runs into view singing "I'm Late! I'm Late!," Alice falls down the rabbit hole into the topsy-turvy alternate world of Wonderland. She grows and shrinks after following the instructions of a haughty caterpillar, attends a "Very Merry Unbirthday" party in the garden of the Mad Hatter and the March Hare, stands in awe as the Cheshire Cat spouts philosophy, listens in rapt attention as Tweedledum and Tweedledee relate the story of the Walrus and the Carpenter (a sequence usually cut when Alice is shown on TV), and closes out her day with a hectic croquet game at the home of the Red Queen. The music and production design of Alice in Wonderland is marvelous, but the film is too much of a good thing, much too frantic to do full honor to the whimsical Carroll original, and far too episodic to hang together as a unified feature film. One tactical error is having Alice weep at mid-point, declaring her wish to go home: This is Alice in Wonderland, Walt, not Wizard of Oz!

As had become their habit, the Three Stooges revamped their old comedy shorts -- in this case 1948's Shivering Sherlocks -- by adding a couple of new scenes featuring the boys only, thus saving on almost everything including the supporting cast. As in the original comedy, the boys run amuck in Christine McIntyre's haunted house(n)</desc>

Unaware that the Duck Hunting Club they are promoting is a front for a gang of criminals, the Stooges sell all their membership cards to police officers. Finding themselves on a duck hunt with a bushel of cops but no ducks, the three nitwits steal some poultry from a local farmer(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Three Stooges</title>
    <sub-title lang="en">A Gem of a Jam</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">A Gem of a Jam. This clever Three Stooges comedy opens, like many of their films do, with a sign: "Drs. Heart-Burns and Belcher." But that's not referring to the Stooges -- they're merely the night janitors, and not very good ones. They have the usual round of mishaps, the funniest being when Curly gets his head stuck in a fish bowl. Even after Larry and Moe free him from the globe, he's not quite right, so they stick him behind the fluoroscope and discover he has swallowed a fish. They retrieve it by sticking a fishing line -- with bait -- down his throat. Their work is further interrupted by a trio of crooks. While escaping the police, one of them was shot in the shoulder, and they insist that the Stooges -- who they have mistaken for doctors -remove the slug. The wounded crook insists on being anesthetized, which confuses the trio until they're told, "That means he wants to be knocked out!" "Ohhh---" they reply knowingly, and they knock him cold with a hammer. But the wounded crook slides off the gurney, out the window and into a waiting police car. To fool the other two gun men (who apparently aren't much smarter than the Stooges), Moe and Larry stick Curly under the sheet. The police finally show up looking for the crooks and both the gunmen and Stooges go running. While the crooks are nabbed, the Stooges wind up in a strange storage area with a bunch of mannequins, a gigantic, spooky jack-in-the-box, a frightened night watchman and a vat of plaster. Curly falls into the plaster and his ghostly white visage scares everyone he encounters until the short comes to a rather abrupt end(n)</desc>

Manuel "Smoke" Galloway (Laurence Fishburne) is the leader of the Black Knights, an underground motorcycle club. Smoke, like most of his fellow Knights, is a successful white collar worker who can afford fancy leathers and top quality bikes, and Smoke has earned a reputation as the "King of Cali," willing take on anyone in a drag race, legal or no. Kid (Derek Luke) is a gifted young rider whose father was once Smoke's mechanic; when Kid's dad died after an accident, Kid set out to become the best biker he could be to carry on his father's name and reputation. Smoke, however, has no room in the Black Knights for Kid, and so he and several fellow outcast riders start their own club, the Biker Boyz, and challenge Smoke to prove once and for all who is the fastest rider on the scene. Biker Boyz also features appearances from Orlando Jones, Lisa Bonet, Djimon Hounsou, Larenz Tate, and Kid Rock(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">H.G. Bissinger's best-selling true-life account of a few months in the life of a high-school football team comes to the screen in this adaptation written and directed by Peter Berg. Odessa, TX, is an oil town in the western part of the state that's home to the Permian High School Panthers, the football team with the best winning record in the state. Odessa is a town with more than its share of problems; the decline of the oil business in Texas has set the city's economy into a tailspin, and racial tensions still erupt into violence on occasion. But football is the one thing that brings all the people of Odessa together, and on Friday nights every fall, as many as 20,000 people fill Permian's football stadium to watch Coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton) and his boys try to lead the team to victory. As Gaines works to build a winning team in a town where victory is prized above all else, however, his players struggle through the emotional trials common to any teenager and ponder the fact that there is little future in their hometown...and that a championship season can be as much a burden as a triumph. Friday Night Lights also stars Lucas Black, Derek Luke, Jay Hernandez, and country singer-turned-actor Tim McGraw(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">9/11: The Falling Man</title>
    <desc lang="en">September 11 2001 was a day that forever changed America. It was a day of many stories: stories of survivors, stories of heroes. But one story simply disappeared. The story of the people who began to fall just minutes after the first plane hit. They were called the jumpers, but soon they were never spoken about again, as if they had never existed. One photograph stood for them all. Anyone who saw it never forgot it. It is one of the most unforgettable images from 9/11: a photograph of a falling man, frozen in mid-air, perfectly parallel with the lines of the World Trade Center. The image ran in newspapers and magazines across the world over the following week, and should have remained one of the defining images of that terrible day. Instead, it was quickly airbrushed out of history. 9/11: The Falling Man follows the trail of that photograph: of the photographer who nearly lost his life shooting it; of the citizens who decried it; of the editors who published it and then reluctantly banned it; of the journalists who tried to uncover the falling man's identity; of the wife and daughters of the identified man and many others. The film asks if this single, harrowing image can help to define our memory of the awful suffering of that day, and help history to give a proper due to the jumpers of 9/11?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Giovanni hosts the final night of the competition in north Surrey, intent on flying the flag for Sicily with some family inspired recipes. Even with help from his father, a tagliatelle tragedy leaves him with Parmesan on his face. Becky is less than impressed with Giovanni's dishes, and matters go from bad to worse when he attempts to serve his home-made pasta. However, poor food doesn't deter a romantic Rob from popping the question to Petrina, sending shockwaves across the dining room. In a final attempt to bag the £1,000, Giovanni invites an opera singer to liven up the proceedings, but his musical initiative may prove too little to save the day.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Hostage</title>
    <desc lang="en">A cop looking for a quieter way of life is thrown into the most dangerous crisis of his life in this thriller based on the novel by Robert Crais. Jeff Talley (Bruce Willis) used to be a hostage negotiator with the Los Angeles Police Department, but after a standoff goes horribly wrong, Talley moves himself and his family to a small, quiet town of Bristo Camino, where he serves as chief of police. When three young criminals attempt to steal a car from a wealthy accountant, the situation quickly spins out of control and the thieves are trapped inside the heavily fortified home, taking the accountant and his family hostage. The Ventura County Sheriff's Department soon arrives on the scene, and Talley eagerly hands over the situation to them, but when he unexpectedly finds himself in telephone contact with one of the children inside, he begins to suspect that the cops are in over their heads. After he's approached by a masked stranger who has an agenda of his own, Talley is forced to decide if he should protect the safety of the family in the house or his own wife and kids. Hostage was the first English-language film from director Florent Emilio Siri(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Christmas season just got a lot less joyous in this very dark comedy. Willie T. Stokes (Billy Bob Thornton) is a con man and a thief who teams up with his friend Marcus (Tony Cox), a midget, for a very special scam each year during the holiday season. Willie gets a job as Santa Claus at a shopping mall, his pal tags along as an elf, and they use their employee status to crack mall security and rob stores blind just before Christmas. However, there's one flaw to this plan -- Willie is a bitter, foul-mouthed and perpetually grouchy alcoholic who doesn't care for kids, and it's all he can do to keep himself from getting fired while on the job. The mall's manager (John Ritter, in his last film appearance) is certain something's wrong with the Santa he's hired, so he asks the mall's chief of security (Bernie Mac) to do some research on Willie. Meanwhile, one of the kids Willie is forced to talk to becomes a regular customer; overweight, awkward, and the frequent target of bullies, the boy manages to arouse something like sympathy from Willie, who tries to give him some advice and develops something vaguely resembling Christmas sprit along the way. Bad Santa was directed by Terry Zwigoff, who enjoyed previous success with Crumb and Ghost World(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Hot Tub Time Machine</title>
    <desc lang="en">Steve Pink's boisterous sci-fi comedy stars John Cusack (who also produced), Rob Corddry, Craig Robinson and Clark Duke as four men who find an unusual portal through time. Adam and his friends Nick and Lou are in their 40s and deeply dissatisfied with the way their lives have turned out. Wanting to recapture a little of the hedonism and youthful anarchy of their 20s, they take a trip to a resort they frequented back then for a trip down memory lane. Taking along Adam's nephew Jacob for the ride, they are disappointed to find that the resort is now more or less a ramshackle ruin. However, after realising that its hot tub still works, they discover to their surprise that the fancy bath is in fact a time machine. So, instead of reminiscing about their youth, they get the chance to actually relive it, as all are transported back to 1986. Cue the movie's raison d'être - a satirical look (via the eyes of Jacob) at the ethos of 80s' teen movies and the general mores of the time, as well as an intriguingly honest exploration of the minds of men in the midst of their mid-life crises. Joining in the fun, with extremely game cameos, are Chevy Chase and Crispin Glover(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">First Dates</title>
    <desc lang="en">Documentary in which singletons meet up with possible partners from the internet for the first time. Each week the show follows eight potential couples as they get to know each other in a restaurant, and at the end of the meal, they decide whether they want to take things further. If the answer is no, some of the unsuccessful men and women will appeal to the public to put themselves forward as their next date, meaning a viewer could be sitting opposite them in a later edition. DJ Terry wants to tame his wild love life, 68-year-old Richard ventures into online dating three years after the death of his wife, 26-year-old Will tries to win over cheerleading coach Fayhe, and Edward, 45, hopes to find a fun-loving woman.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Youngstown Boys. An exploration of the class and power dynamics in college sports through the interconnected journeys of one-time dynamic running back Maurice Clarett and former elite head coach Jim Tressel. Clarett and Tressel emerged from opposite sides of the tracks in Youngstown, Ohio, and then joined up for a magical season at Ohio State University in 2002 that produced the first national football championship for the school in over 30 years. Shortly after, Clarett was suspended from college football and began a downward spiral that ended with a prison term. Tressel continued at Ohio State for another eight years before his career there also ended in scandal. Also available in HD(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Clare Balding travels to South Africa to join a veterinary team trying to help a rhino called Thandi who was attacked by poachers for her horn. For the first time, a plastic surgeon will attempt a skin graft on the animal to heal the wound. She also visits the rainforest of Borneo to follow the story of an orangutan who needs cataracts removing from her eyes so that she can be released back into the wild. Elsewhere, vet Steve Leonard takes a trip to Chicago's Lincoln Park Zoo, where the latest technology is being used to help chimpanzees with heart disease. He also visits the South African city of Pretoria, where a Cape fur seal requires a CT scan to identify the root cause of her illness, and a giraffe urgently needs to be anaesthetised to treat a leg injury.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Actor Bruce Willis and writer/director M. Night Shyamalan reunite after the surprise success of The Sixth Sense for this supernatural thriller. David Dunne (Willis) is taking a train from New York City back home to Philadelphia after a job interview that didn't go well when his car jumps the tracks and collides with an oncoming engine, with David the only survivor among the 131 passengers on board. Astoundingly, David is not only alive, he hardly seems to have been touched. As David wonders what has happened to him and why he was able to walk away, he encounters a mysterious stranger, Elijah Prince (Samuel L. Jackson), who explains to David that there are a certain number of people who are "unbreakable" -- they have remarkable endurance and courage, a predisposition toward dangerous behavior, and feel invincible but also have strange premonitions of terrible events. Is David "unbreakable"? And if he is, what are the physical and psychological ramifications of this knowledge? Unbreakable also stars Robin Wright-Penn as Audrey, David's wife; the supporting cast includes Spencer Treat Clark and Joey Perillo(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">August Rush</title>
    <desc lang="en">Kirsten Sheridan's family drama stars Freddie Highmore (Charlie from Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) as Evan Taylor, a musical prodigy searching for his parents. When pregnant cellist Lyla Novacek was hit by a car, her controlling father and manager told her she'd lost the baby; in reality she gave birth prematurely and her father sent the infant to an orphanage. Eleven years later, when Evan finds out that his parents are alive, he sets out to find them, taking inspiration from the music around him. The heart of the film is Evan's almost mystical ability to 'feel' music, a challenging concept that works, thanks to inventive work by main score composer Mark Mancina. August Rush also stars Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Evan's rock singer father, and Robin Williams as a modern day Fagin who Evan meets during his search for his family(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">August Rush</title>
    <desc lang="en">Kirsten Sheridan's family drama stars Freddie Highmore (Charlie from Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) as Evan Taylor, a musical prodigy searching for his parents. When pregnant cellist Lyla Novacek was hit by a car, her controlling father and manager told her she'd lost the baby; in reality she gave birth prematurely and her father sent the infant to an orphanage. Eleven years later, when Evan finds out that his parents are alive, he sets out to find them, taking inspiration from the music around him. The heart of the film is Evan's almost mystical ability to 'feel' music, a challenging concept that works, thanks to inventive work by main score composer Mark Mancina. August Rush also stars Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Evan's rock singer father, and Robin Williams as a modern day Fagin who Evan meets during his search for his family(n)</desc>

Jamal has soon allied himself with a peasant girl and a broken-down ex-knight to defeat the evil King Leo (Kevin Conway) and his bullying minion, Sir Knolte (Tom Wilkinson). In the meantime, Jamal busts some modern dance moves on the medieval dance floor and encounters such intriguing residents of the period as knaves, peasants, archers, jousting knights, maidens, a princess, and even a giant. Black Knight (2001) is the sophomore directing vehicle of longtime television producer Gil Junger, who joins Lawrence in replacing the team originally attached to this comic vehicle, director F.

    <title lang="en">Mafia!</title>

The opening emulates a Saul Bass sequence with Anthony Cortino (Jay Mohr) in a flight amid flames much like Robert De Niro in the Casino credits. After flashbacks go back in time to Sicily, Coppola/Scorsese references abound. Young Vincenzo (Jason Fuchs) travels to America to later become the clumsy chief of organized crime (with the late Lloyd Bridges as the aging Vincenzo) with his sons -- short-fused Joey (Billy Burke) and educated Anthony. Tony's WASP fiancee is Diane (Christina Applegate), recalling Diane Keaton in the Coppola films. During the wedding, assassins try to do away with Don Vincenzo, who's hospitalized, so Tony sets out to gain revenge for the murder attempt. In Vegas, Tony gets involved with showgirl Pepper (Pamela Gidley). When betrayals begin, can violence be far behind? This was Lloyd Bridges' final movie, and the film is dedicated to him(n)</desc>

Meanwhile, Kevin (Ioan Gruffudd) operates an animal shelter that has fallen on hard times; unless he's able to find new financial support, the lost dogs he's been caring for will have nowhere to go. Kevin and his girlfriend Chloe (Alice Evans), who happens to be Cruella's parole officer, get the idea of bringing their plight to the people through the press, but media reports of the shelter's problems attract an unlikely benefactor -- Cruella. While Ms. De Vil claims the purest of intentions, it seems the shelter is housing a large number of dalmatians, and in cahoots with mad fashion designer Monsieur Le Pelt (Gérard Depardieu), she plans to turn the puppies into haute couture . 102 Dalmatians was the first live-action feature for director Kevin Lima, who previously helmed two animated features for Disney, A Goofy Movie and Tarzan(n)</desc>

The film then moves to the present day, where Egyptologist Daniel Jackson (James Spader) is busily trying to convince a group of skeptics that the pyramids were not built by man, but by an extraterrestrial force. After the lecture, a military man approaches him and offers him a job translating the said ring; its inscriptions actually constitute a map to a massive stargate (or interstellar portal). The army sends over resident crackpot colonel Jack O'Neill (Kurt Russell) to travel through the stargate and see what's on the other side; Jackson accompanies him, and the two men turn up in a desert planet on the other side of the universe, with three moons in its sky. The world in question is ruled by Ra (Jaye Davidson), a hermaphroditic Egyptian sun god, who oppresses hordes of slave workers.

    <title lang="en">The Happening</title>
    <desc lang="en">Lady in the Water director M. Night Shyamalan puts PG-13 suspense on pause to tell this grim apocalyptic tale about a family fleeing a natural disaster that poses a grave threat to the whole of humanity. Philadelphia high-school science teacher Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) is discussing the disappearance of the bees with his students when the staff is summoned to the theater and briefed about a mysterious event that is currently unfolding in New York City. According to reports, citizens in the vicinity of Central Park have suddenly and inexplicably begun seizing up just before killing themselves by whatever means are at their disposal. As the phenomena begins to spread and talk of terrorism fills the airwaves, Elliot, his wife, Alma (Zooey Deschanel), their friend Julian (John Leguizamo), and his daughter, Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez), board a train bound for the presumed safety of the country. When the train screeches to a halt before arriving at its final destination, however, the frightened passengers are forced to fend for themselves as each consecutive news report paints an increasingly grim picture of the situation in more urbanized areas. Theories abound on what could be causing the unexplainable rash of suicides, but the only thing that everyone seems to agree on is that it's some kind of airborne contagion that is carried in the wind. It would appear that humankind's reign on planet Earth has come to an end, but perhaps if this small band of survivors can find a safe place to lie low until this all blows over, all hope for survival of the species might not be lost just yet(n)</desc>

Connie (Vardalos) and Carla (Toni Collette) are best friends who've shared the same dream ever since they were teenagers -- making a name for themselves in the musical theater. However, after years of treading water on Chicago's dinner theater circuit and playing bottom-of-the-barrel nightclubs, the two are facing middle age with minimal career success. One evening after a performance, Connie and Carla have the misfortune of witnessing the murder of nightclub owner Frank (Michael Roberds) by low-level Mafiosi; the gals are seen by the shooters, and they hit the road in fear for their lives. Connie and Carla end up in Los Angeles, where they struggle to create new identities for themselves. After witnessing a drag review at a nightclub, they realize that even they have more talent than most of the men performing that evening, and they decide to pose as female impersonators in hopes of landing a gig. Connie and Carla's new act is an immediate hit, and soon they're the toast of L.A.'s gay community. But the women discover it's difficult to keep on fooling people into believing they're men, and things become even more complicated when the Mobsters discover that Connie and Carla are in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, Connie finds herself falling for Jeff (David Duchovny), a regular guy looking for his cross-dressing brother who can't understand why he's developing a crush on a drag queen(n)</desc>

Married to commodities trader Stephen Taylor (Michael Douglas), Emily Bradford (Gwyneth Paltrow) is romantically involved with artist David Shaw (Viggo Mortensen). Aware of this affair, Stephen researches David's past, visits his loft studio, and informs David that he knows about his aliases, jail sentences, and various cons and scams directed at rich women. Then Stephen offers David $500,000 to murder Emily, and David agrees. The plan is calculated to make the murder look like an accident, but events soon go on an unscheduled course. Enter Detective Mohamed Karaman (David Suchet). Knott's original play opened June 1952 in London, followed by a New York run that began October 1952. Several books and sources describe how Hitchcock's film was made in 3-D but neglect to mention that, despite trade screenings in 3-D, Dial M for Murder was originally released in 1954 with ordinary, flat 2-D prints. It was finally shown to audiences in 3-D during the mid-'80s(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Apollo 13</title>
    <desc lang="en">A routine space shot goes horribly awry and three astronauts are stranded in space. Now NASA must figure out how to rescue them in this historically accurate thriller. The odyssey begins on April 11, 1970 as the Apollo 13 rocket is prepared for a moon shot; it will be NASA's fifth lunar landing. The man who was to pilot the command module, Ken Mattingly has been exposed to measles and must be replaced with the laid-back swinger Jack Swigert. The mission is lead by veteran astronaut Jim Lovell and the lunar module is to be flown by Fred Haise. The three are launched into space two days later and things proceed smoothly until an oxygen tank suddenly explodes during a routine operation. Now the crew must face a dwindling air supply, an unstable power supply, and the chance they may die of carbon dioxide poisoning. There is also the chance that the men could freeze to death while waiting for Mission Control to solve the dilemma of whether they should have the capsule go around the moon and return via "slingshot" effect, or have the craft turn around immediately. Mission Control has one other concern as well. At this point they don't know if the crippled space craft can survive the intense heat of reentering the Earth's atmosphere. Historically, the craft did make it safely back and all the men survived. The suspense in this film comes from waiting to see exactly how it was done(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Miami Vice</title>
    <desc lang="en">Writer and director Michael Mann updates the groundbreaking television crime series he created in the 1980s with this stylish thriller. Ricardo Tubbs (Jamie Foxx) and Sonny Crockett (Colin Farrell) are two police detectives working undercover in Florida; Tubbs is smart, cool, and resourceful, while Crockett has his own way of doing things, though he stays close enough to the rules to stay out of trouble. Their latest assignment is to get the goods on Arcangel de Jesus Montoya (Luis Tosar), a local drug kingpin whose men are believed to be responsible for a handful of recent murders. In order to infiltrate Montoya's operation, Tubbs and Crockett pose as powerboat racers willing to use their talents to pilot drug-smuggling ships for the right price. The detectives' ruse works, but as they dig deeper into Montoya's inner circle, they become involved in a dangerous operation that will take them to Haiti and Cuba, where neither the Miami Police Force nor the United States government can help them if things go wrong. Crockett also begins walking a risky path when he begins an affair with Isabella (Gong Li), a woman high up in Montoya's organization. Miami Vice marked Michael Mann's third consecutive directorial effort with Jamie Foxx after Ali and Collateral(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Documentary catching up with London's Crossrail engineers less than two years after the project's excavations uncovered the 14th-century Charterhouse plague pit. In an extraordinary turn of events, further work on the Liverpool Street station has revealed another burial ground, this time accommodating the capital's radicals, rebels and outsiders. The Bedlam burial ground, which is thought to be the final resting place of nearly 20,000 people, was believed to be lost for around 300 years. Now, with the excavation process under way, archaeologists and historians have been using bone analysis techniques in conjunction with parish records to reveal the names and life stories of those whose remains were found on-site. Their research reveals that people came from as far afield as Africa to work in the English capital, and sheds light on how pollution first became one of the city's most prolific killers.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Clare Balding travels to South Africa to join a veterinary team trying to help a rhino called Thandi who was attacked by poachers for her horn. For the first time, a plastic surgeon will attempt a skin graft on the animal to heal the wound. She also visits the rainforest of Borneo to follow the story of an orangutan who needs cataracts removing from her eyes so that she can be released back into the wild. Elsewhere, vet Steve Leonard takes a trip to Chicago's Lincoln Park Zoo, where the latest technology is being used to help chimpanzees with heart disease. He also visits the South African city of Pretoria, where a Cape fur seal requires a CT scan to identify the root cause of her illness, and a giraffe urgently needs to be anaesthetised to treat a leg injury.(n)</desc>

Susan (Blanchard Ryan) and Daniel (Daniel Travis) are a busy married couple on an island vacation. They board a vessel called the Reef Explorer with a group of other scuba divers, traveling 15 miles out to sea. Since they are certified to dive in open waters, the couple breaks off from the group to go exploring. The Reef Explorer accidentally leaves without a proper head count, leaving them stranded in shark-infested waters. Kentis and producer wife Laura Lau did all the filming themselves in the actual ocean without extraneous special effects, while the actors wore special steel-mesh under their wetsuits in the scenes where actual sharks were involved. Open Water was shown at the Sundance Film Festival in 2004 as part of the American Spectrum competition(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">New York City, 1863. Before there was the city we know today, a city of wealth, power and infinite dreams, New York was a very different place, a fledgling young city where the desire for a better life raged in crime-ridden streets. Here, as the Nations own survival was being tested by the ongoing Civil War, a vast and dangerous underworld was born in the streets. These were the gangs of New York, as portrayed in Herbert Asburys classic book, whose racketeering, bootlegging, swindling, gambling and murdering would become legendary - and whose culture of corruption threatened the very survival of Americas working people. In the young, unfinished City, it was a time of ruthlessness, intolerance and fear. But it was also a time of extraordinary bravery, as those pushed to the edge fought for the freedom of future generations. Director Martin Scorsese sets this epic drama in this defining moment in New York City history, an era whose conflicts helped define who and what makes an American. Against the backdrop of this brave new world unfolds a story about a fatherless sons search for honor, vengeance and the courage to remake his life(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A woman studying a crime of the past finds her own life becoming a morass of suspicion and deceit in this drama based on the novel by Anita Shreve. Jean Janes (Catherine McCormack) is a photographer working on a project that would document surviving evidence of a multiple murder that occurred a hundred years ago -- when a man named Louis Wagner (Ciaran Hinds) brutally killed two immigrant women from Norway with an axe, only to discover a third, Maren Hontvedt (Sarah Polley), witnessed the mayhem and survived to identify him in court. Jean travels to the small New Hampshire coastal town where the killings occurred with her husband Thomas (Sean Penn), an award-winning poet; his brother Rich (Josh Lucas); and Rich's girlfriend Adaline (Elizabeth Hurley). As Jean digs deeper into the troubling facts of the long-ago murder, as well as the tangential details of Maren Honvedt's unhappy marriage to John Hontvedt (Ulrich Thomsen) and her incestuous affair with her brother Evan (Anders W. Berthelsen), Jean begins to believe that she has a crisis of her own to contend with: she is convinced Thomas is having an affair with Adaline. The Weight of Water also features Katrin Cartlidge as Maren's sister Karen and Vinessa Shaw as her sister-in-law Anethe(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Grandma's Boy</title>
    <desc lang="en">Can the world's oldest adolescent maintain his cool while living with his grandmother? Alex (Allen Covert) is a 35-year-old video-game fanatic who gave up a career in accounting to take a job testing games for Brainasium, the company behind the wildly popular game "Eternal Death Slayer." While Alex took a big pay cut to land his dream job, he's happy with his work and is making ends meet -- until he discovers that his roommate hasn't paid the rent for the last six months, using the money to finance repeated visits to a local massage parlor. After running out of friends who will let him sleep on their couch, Alex swallows his pride and moves in with his grandma Lily (Doris Roberts), who loves Alex and is happy to give him a place to stay in exchange for doing chores around the house. Lily shares her home with two friends, perpetually confused Bea (Shirley Knight) and sexually adventurous Grace (Shirley Jones), and between the three of them, there's always work to be done, keeping Alex busy nearly every night. While Alex tells his co-workers he's living with three attractive women who are running him ragged, they don't know the real story; in the meantime, Alex is trying to charm Brainasium's beautiful new executive, Samantha (Linda Cardellini), while butting heads with the firm's space-case CEO Cheezle (Kevin Nealon) and J.P. (Joel David Moore), a teenage game designer who is no longer in touch with reality. Grandma's Boy was the first feature film from director Nicholaus Goossen(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Picture Perfect</title>
    <desc lang="en">Television actress Jennifer Anniston makes her feature-film debut in a starring role as Kate, a bright but mousey and single young advertising executive seeking to climb the corporate ladder. But though she has all the right qualifications professionally, Kate has a problem in her boss's eyes: she's single. In his opinion, only married and henceforth deeply indebted people should be on the fast track for promotions because they have more motivation to remain loyal to a company. Desperate to ascend, Kate follows overenthusiastic colleague Darcy's (Illeana Douglas) bad advice and fabricates a fabulous fiance. Kate's other motivation for inventing a lover is to capture the attentions of the office Lothario, Sam (Kevin Bacon), a lean, sexy guy who thinks Kate is too good to warrant his bad-boy affections. For her dream fiance, Kate chooses handsome, heroic wedding-photographer Nick (Jay Mohr), whom she recently met at a friend's marriage in Boston. Not realizing that Nick is secretly in love with her, Kate offers him $1,000 to pretend to be her intended and to break up with her during an important business dinner. Meanwhile, Sam, upon learning that Kate is a taken women, launches a successful seduction campaign. With everything finally going her way, Kate couldn't be happier. But when Nick finally arrives, her careful plans begin to go spectacularly awry, and she is forced to face the truth about her feelings for the sneaky Sam and the patient, knightly Nick. Picture Perfect is an average-quality romantic comedy, one that would work especially on television. Anniston does well in her role as the confused Kate, exuding an off-beat beauty, considerable charm and a calculated comic timing, but whether or not she has the chops to make it as a movie star remains to be seen. Her co-star Mohr (Tom Cruise's slimy rival in Jerry Maguire) is more natural and charismatic. Though more low-key than the tightly-wound Anniston, he managed to steal most of the scenes in which he appeared(n)</desc>

Roland is hanging out with his two best friends, whom he also first met in school, Mike (Omar Epps), a solid regular guy, and Slim (Richard T.

They talk about the old days and flash back on growing up in Inglewood, California (nicknamed "The Wood") in the 1980's, when Run DMC and Eric B &amp; Rakim were the happening sounds, and guys used to argue over who was hotter, Vanity or Apollonia. At the last minute, Roland takes off, wanting to pay Tanya a visit, and Mike and Slim are determined to track him down and make sure that he gets to the altar on time. The Wood was the debut feature film for writer/director Rick Famuyiwa, whose first short subject, Blacktop Lingo, won an enthusiastic response at the 1996 Sundance Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A handful of college students looking for a good time are thrown into a world of danger in this homage to the slasher film cycle of the 1970s and '80s. Ben (Joel David Moore) has just been given his walking papers by his girlfriend and is deeply depressed. Needing a pick-me-up, Ben and his friend Marcus (Deon Richmond) head to New Orleans for Mardi Gras, and take in a "Haunted Swamp Tour," with master of ceremonies Shawn (Parry Shen) guiding guests through a spooky patch of bayou country. Along the way, Ben and Marcus meet a pair of half-bright exotic dancers, Misty (Mercedes McNab) and Jenna (Joleigh Fioreavanti), as well as Marybeth (Tamara Feldman), a pretty girl who is secretive about her past. As they tour the swamp, Shawn tells his customers about the local legend of Victor Crowley, a deformed man who was taunted by the other children living near the swamp until he was nearly bludgeoned with an axe by his father while trying to open the door of their burning shack. While Ben and Marcus don't think much of the story at first, it doesn't take long before they have serious reason to believe Victor Crowley is still at large -- and is looking to settle some old scores.
