    <desc lang="en">(1999) M Night Shyamalan's chiller about a boy who has the not-entirely-welcome ability to directly contact the dead. Bruce Willis stars as child psychologist Dr Malcolm Crowe, who is asked to help Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), who claims he can 'see dead people'. Crowe is sceptical at first, but - prompted partly by a past case he felt he badly let down - he's gradually convinced that the boy is telling the truth. Crowe believes that actively engaging with the ghostly presences could help both Sear and the spirits to find peace. Overcoming his terror, the lad finds that communicating with the deceased does, at first, seem to be beneficial. But then matters take on their own momentum, leading to one of the director's trademark plot twists... Also starring Toni Collette. M,W,S,(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Number 23</title>
    <desc lang="en">Jim Carrey and Virginia Madsen star in this dark psychological thriller from director Joel Schumacher. Walter Sparrow is leading a contented life until his wife Agatha innocently gives him a battered old paperback as a gift. As he reads, Sparrow is astonished by the parallels between his life and that of the novel's protagonist, Fingerling. But as the plot progresses it grows darker, featuring themes of transgressive sex, suicide and murder. It also hinges around Fingerling's obsession with the number 23 - a prime number that seems to pop up everywhere in the universe once you start to notice it. It's not long before 23 takes a similar hold on Sparrow. And, when he begins unjustly to view Agatha in the same distrustful light that Fingerling views his own spouse Fabrizia, it seems as if Sparrow has locked on to the same tragic trajectory as the story's lead character. Or can he find a way to wrench himself from the novel's grip?(n)</desc>

It's not easy being the brother of a benevolent and beloved saint, and no one knows that better than Fred Claus (Vaughn). After struggling for years to live up to the example set by his younger sibling Nicholas (Paul Giamatti), Fred has finally given up. These days Fred is working as a repo man taken to stealing the items he repossesses, and his shady tactics have just landed him in jail. While Mrs. Claus vehemently insists that Fred fend for himself, Nicholas refuses to sit idly by as his brother rots in jail and agrees to set bail if Fred will repay the debt by coming to the North Pole and help make toys for the upcoming Christmas season. But Fred isn't nearly as productive as your average elf, and he's got quite an attitude to boot. With Christmas fast approaching and Fred threatening to sideline Nicholas' entire finely tuned operation, the brother that always struggled to get out from under his sibling's substantial shadow finds out just how far the patience of a saint can be pushed before jolly old Santa reaches his breaking point(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Who Wants to Be a Millionaire</title>
    <desc lang="en">Although the once-hot game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? had lost its luster as a prime-time ABC offering, the producers felt that there was enough life left in the property to warrant a Monday-through-Friday syndicated version. Taking over from the earlier series' host Regis Philbin was Meredith Vieira of The View. To make certain that the series would not be bankrupted after its first week on the air, the questions posed to contestants were considerably harder than those on the prime-time incarnation. Also, the famous "fastest finger" round was eliminated, taking some of the pressure off the contestants when they struggled to come up with answers. The most noteworthy change from the original version was the absence of Regis Philbin's familiar catchphrases: One would never hear Meredith Vieira chime in with the legendary "Is that your final answer?" The syndicated Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? was launched on September 16, 2002(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Boobs in Arms. World War II was just heating up, but the U.S. hadn't yet entered the fighting when the Three Stooges made this comic short. It opens with the boys selling greeting cards on the street, none too successfully. One surly guy in particular is a victim of the Stooges' harassment. To get away from his wrath, the boys dash into an apartment building, where they find a weepy young woman who thinks her husband doesn't love her anymore. To help her out, the Stooges offer to try to make her husband jealous. The woman's spouse turns out to be the very same man they harassed a few minutes earlier. To get away from him -- again -- the guys get in what they think is a bread line, but it's really a recruitment line for the Army. In a flash the Stooges are in uniform -- only to discover that their sergeant is the very same angry husband. They manage to make it through basic training and are sleeping through bomb blasts when they're woken up and sent on a mission. The sergeant has been captured and they're supposed to bomb enemy headquarters with laughing gas. Naturally, the gas shell explodes on them and they're captured. At the enemy headquarters, they manage to knock everyone unconscious while laughing uncontrollably. The place is being shelled by the American troops, and the Stooges, still laughing, ride one of the shells as it soars out of the building(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Pop Goes the Easel. The Three Stooges are let loose in an art gallery in this fine 2-reel comedy which marked the team's first collaboration with director Del Lord. The amiable Lord would go on to direct some of the Stooges' best comedies, forty in all, through the early 1940s. In Pop Goes the Easel, Moe, Larry and Curly were joined by Stooges regulars Phyllis Crane and Bobby Burns, as well as newcomer Elinor Vanderveer, a statuesque dowager type who had already survived several on-screen confrontations with Laurel and Hardy comedies(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Bullet to the Head</title>
    <desc lang="en">A cop and a killer forge a shaky partnership to find out who killed their partners in this throwback buddy action flick starring Sylvester Stallone, and directed by vet Walter Hill. Battle-scarred New Orleans hitman James Bonomo (Stallone) and his longtime partner Louis (Jon Seda) have just executed their latest hit, a cop named Hank Greely (Holt McCallany) when Louis is killed by hulking enforcer Keegan (Jason Momoa) before they can get paid. In the wake of a failed attempt on Bonomo's life as well, Keegan flees the scene, but not before his intended target gets a good look at his face. Meanwhile, Korean NYPD cop Taylor Kwon (Sung Kang) shows up in town determined to find out who killed Greely, his former partner. When Kwon tracks Bonomo down to find out who hired him, both realize that their best hope for catching their respective partners' killers is to team up. Before long, their trail of clues has led them to sleazy lawyer Marcus Baptiste (Christian Slater), who is currently caught up in some shady business dealings with the mysterious and powerful Robert Nkomo Morel (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) that could implicate some serious power players in Washington, D.C. Now each new move that Bonomo and Kwon make could be their last, and as the cop does his best to stay on the right side of the law, the killer uses the only tactics he knows to get results. But even if they manage to get their man, that doesn't change the fact that they'll have to deal with one another once they've taken down their target(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Angelina Jolie directs this true-life tale of Louis Zamperini, the Olympic track star who survived a plane crash in World War II, only to fight for his life against nature and eventually as a prisoner of war. Joel and Ethan Coen provide the script. Louis (Jack O'Connell) grows up a rough-hewn kid on the verge of becoming a full-on delinquent, until his brother starts training him to be a track star. Louis excels at the sport, and eventually represents America at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. During his training, he learns to become resilient and disciplined; his brother's words of advice, "If you can take it, you can make it," push him to overcome any adversity. He must live up to that adage under the most extreme circumstances after his plane is shot down during another bombing raid. He is stranded at sea for more than a month, only to be found by the Japanese and forced to endure constant physical abuse at the hands of sadistic prison-camp guard Mutsuhiro Watanabe (Japanese pop star Miyavi), who wants to break Louis' indomitable spirit(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Discovering Snowdonia.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Julia Bradbury visits the picturesque Mawddach estuary in Snowdonia. Located between Dolgellau and the coastal resort of Barmouth, this area became a popular tourist destination in the 1860s thanks to the railway connecting it to England's major cities. Since the closure of the train line, the location is now one of the least visited in the region, but has retained its stunning natural beauty.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Family Matters.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Zoologist George McGavin continues his exploration of the primate world, considering how the secret to their success is the ability to live in close-knit family and social groups. This is demonstrated by the emperor tamarin males conned into childcare in Peru and the South African vervet monkeys that have a sophisticated alarm system to protect them from predators. But living together often has its problems, like the Barbary macaques in Gibraltar who have their babies stolen by others out to impress their boss, the matriarchal ring-tailed lemur societies where females battle one another with their children in tow, and the hamadryas baboons of Ethiopia where the males rule with an iron fist.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Richard Hammond presents this chilly version of Total Wipeout, which sees the contestants wrapping up warm to tackle a snow-covered course with winter-themed obstacles and seasonal challenges. They must manoeuvre themselves past Granny's House, watching out for the angry dog nipping at their ankles and a front door guaranteed to smack them in the face. They then cling onto the ski lift to avoid plunging into the icy waters, before riding the conveyor belt that throws them onto those old Wipeout favourites, the big red balls. Amanda Byram laughs it up at the side of the course.(n)</desc>

As children, Cheryl and her brother watched their mother endure intense suffering at the hands of their mentally and physically abusive father, and Bobbi was just getting her life together when she fell gravely ill. The loss was too much for Cheryl to take, and before long she sank so deeply into heroin addiction that it destroyed her marriage. Four years later, Cheryl has hit rock bottom.

Later, as Cheryl begins her arduous journey through the wilderness, those painful memories come flooding back as she encounters numerous dangers and disheartening setbacks.

Cheryl was just 22 years old when her mother Bobbi (Laura Dern) died of cancer in 1991. As children, Cheryl and her brother watched their mother endure intense suffering at the hands of their mentally and physically abusive father, and Bobbi was just getting her life together when she fell gravely ill. The loss was too much for Cheryl to take, and before long she sank so deeply into heroin addiction that it destroyed her marriage. Four years later, Cheryl has hit rock bottom. She knows that unless she makes a change, the future she had once hoped for will slip permanently out of reach. Later, as Cheryl begins her arduous journey through the wilderness, those painful memories come flooding back as she encounters numerous dangers and disheartening setbacks. However, the kindness of strangers helps her summon the courage and endurance she'll need to stay the path(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Murder on a Reservation. A hidden war of words rages on in the A&amp;E program American Justice: Murder on a Reservation. Leonard Peltier is one of the most well-known political prisoners in America. Serving two life sentences for the murders of federal agents in 1975, the Nobel Peace Prize nominee maintains his innocence while blasting the intimidating techniques of the U.S. government. The shootout which put him in prison is known as "the Incident at Oglala" and has roots going back to the massacre at Wounded Knee. Peltier claims he is serving time for his radical views on Native American rights while the government thinks it has finally tamed a violent troublemaker. But, beyond the political ramifications, Peltier's case is full of inconsistencies. There are no witnesses or physical evidence to identify Peltier as the shooter. During his trial, he was deprived of crucial background testimony which established the FBI's reign of terror over the South Dakota reservation. Peltier continues his appeal for justice while many are left wondering what really happened that fateful day(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The work of officers from the Central Motorway Police Group as they target cable thieves, a crime that is costing Britain more than £1billion each year and causing chaos to its transport system. The price of copper and precious metal has reached such levels that 500 metres of cable is worth about £50,000 - so these days, when the lights go out on the motorway, it isn't necessarily a cost-cutting exercise or a fault. More often than not, it's because a group of organised metal thieves has struck. Jamie Theakston narrates.(n)</desc>

Unusual structures such as this were built on lakes all over Scotland, but this is the first to be explored fully, over the course of an eight-week dive. The clean, peaty quality of the water means the artefacts uncovered are perfectly preserved, providing a remarkable insight into how these buildings were constructed and how the residents lived 2,600 years ago.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Nine Months</title>
    <desc lang="en">A single man faces the terrifying prospect of seeing his carefree life dashed by a visit from the stork in this comedy. Samuel Falkner (Hugh Grant) is a child psychiatrist who has no kids of his own and doesn't want any, which leaves him a bit shaken when his girlfriend of five years, Rebecca Taylor (Julianne Moore) announces that she's pregnant. Suddenly, Samuel is plagued by paranoid fantasies about how marriage and fatherhood will change his life, which are not at all soothed by frequent visits from Rebecca's chronically-pregnant friend Gail Dwyer (Joan Cusack) and her half-bright lummox of a husband, Marty (Tom Arnold). Too selfish to deal with Rebecca's needs, Samuel parts company with her and takes a last stab at playing the field, but when he sees an ultrasound of his soon-to-be-born son, he decides that it's time to face his responsibilities before it's too late. Nine Months also features Robin Williams in a small role as Dr. Kosevich, an ob-gyn with a weak grasp of the English language(n)</desc>

James Marshall plays Tommy Riley, a Windy City high school student conned into participating in the illegal underground boxing arenas of the South Side of Chicago. In high school, Tommy was a prize boxer, and this skill comes in handy when his Father (John Heard) runs up a large gambling debt. When a sleazy boxing manager (Robert Loggia) spots Tommy defending himself during recess, he offers him quick money to box. Tommy, although he hates the sport, readily agrees, thinking his winnings will help his father pay off his debts. He quickly comes under the thumb of unscrupulous boxing promoter Horn (Brian Dennehy), who is involved in fight-fixing and dirty fighting. Manipulating the odds and exploiting his boxers make Horn rich and more venal. In the rancid environment, Tommy befriends another fighter, Lincoln (Cuba Gooding Jr.), a black fighter who sees fighting as his way out of poverty. Inevitably, Horn arranges for the two friends to duke it out in the ring together(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This daily show-biz gossip and "expose" series was a spinoff of the popular interactive website TMZ, an acronym for the "Thirty Mile Zone" surrounding Hollywood. Created in 2005, TMZ had gained national prominence by breaking the story of Mel Gibson's anti-Semitic tirade after his arrest for drunken driving. By the time the TV version of TMZ premiered the week of September 10, 2007, the operation had once again scooped its scandal-rag competition with its coverage of O.J. Simpson's profanity-laden "invasion" of the home of a collectibles dealer who was allegedly selling Simpson memorabilia without permission. In fact, TMZ on TV had a wealth of celebrity-meltdown yarns to choose from during its shakedown week, ranging from the substance-abuse problems of Lindsay Lohan to the ill-fated "comeback" concert of Britney Spears. Harvey Levin, managing editor for both versions of TMZ, appeared on-camera as a correspondent, along with Sean Borg, Michael Hundgen, Katie Darryl and Teresa Strasser. TMZ on TV was seen primarily on local Fox or Fox-owned affiliates throughout the U.S(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl star as legendary Formula One drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda respectively in this biographical drama set during the 1970s, at the peak of their heated rivalry. Both on the track and off, Hunt (Hemsworth) and Lauda (Bruhl) couldn't have been more different. Yet as much as Englishman Hunt's showy public persona clashed with Lauda's reputation for tightly-controlled perfectionism, both men remained bound together by one undeniable fact -- they were both among the best drivers ever to grace the racetrack. When a horrific crash during the 1976 Grand Prix at the Nürburgring nearly claims Lauda's life, however, a grudging respect begins to develop between the two racers as Hunt realizes just how devoted his greatest adversary is to the sport they both love. Olivia Wilde and Alexandra Maria Lara co-star in a film directed by Academy Award-winner Ron Howard, and penned by Peter Morgan (Frost/Nixon, Hereafter)(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Bart on the Road. Rather than postpone his vacation to Hong Kong, where he can buy "custom made suits at slave labor prices," Principal Skinner (voice of Harry Shearer) starts Spring Vacation a day early at Springfield Elementary School by declaring Friday "Go To Work With Your Parents Day." While Lisa Simpson (voice of Yeardley Smith) spends the day with her father Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright) ends up watching his aunts Patty and Selma (both voiced by Julie Kavner) torment patrons at the Department of Motor Vehicles. While no one is watching, Bart makes a driver's license for himself, and when he and his friends Milhouse (voice of Pamela Hayden) and Nelson (also voiced by Cartwright) discover easily intimidated class brain Martin Prince (voice of Russi Taylor) has made $500 investing in soy with his stockbroker father, the boys pool their resources and go on a road trip. Telling his parents he's attending the National Grammar Rodeo in Canada, Bart and his pals rent a car and head to Knoxville, Tennessee for the World's Fair, unaware that the fair ended fourteen years earlier. While Bart and his friends are stranded in Knoxville, Lisa unexpectedly enjoys bonding with her dad at the Power Plant, until she learns her suspicions that Bart is up to no good are well founded. "Bart On The Road" was first aired on May 31, 1996(n)</desc>

Seymour Skinner (voice of Harry Shearer) is being feted with a special presentation to honor his twenty years as principal of Springfield Elementary School, but the party takes an unexpected turn when a man in a military uniform appears and announces he's the real Sgt. Seymour Skinner (voice of Martin Sheen). Skinner admits the man is telling the truth and shares his true story -- as a teenager, he was a greasy-haired delinquent named Armin Tamzarian, but a stint in the Army put him back on the straight and narrow when he met Sgt. Skinner and learned the value of discipline and small-town life. When Skinner was presumed dead in a mortar attack, Tamzarian decided to take his name and fulfill his great dream of becoming principal of Springfield Elementary. Disillusioned with the revelation that he's an imposter, Tamzarian is fired, and moves to Capitol City to live the sleazy life that was his destiny. Sgt. Skinner is appointed principal in Tamzarian's place, but before long everyone realizes they liked the old Seymour Skinner better than the real thing, including his mother (voice of Tress MacNeille).

    <sub-title lang="en">Miracle on Evergreen Terrace</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Miracle on Evergreen Terrace. It's Christmas Eve in Springfield, and Bart Simpson (voice of Nancy Cartwright) can barely contain his excitement at the prospect of a big stack of presents. Waking up before the rest on the family on the big day, Bart starts opening gifts without them, but after getting a toy fire truck, he ironically sets fire to the Simpsons' artificial Christmas tree, destroying all the gifts under it in the process. Bart is able to hide the evidence before anyone can see him, but when Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta), Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) and Lisa (voice of Yeardley Smith) ask what happened to their presents, Bart lies and says a burglar made off with them. Homer and Marge report the robbery to the police, and when newsman Kent Brockman (voice of Harry Shearer) puts the story of the Yuletide theft on television, the city opens up its collective heart (and wallet) and the family receive a windfall of fifteen thousand dollars. Homer impulsively spends the money on a new car, but he wrecks it while driving home, and Bart finally tells the truth about what happened to the tree and the presents. When the people of Springfield learn the truth, they turn on the Simpson family until Marge pledges to find a way to pay them back for their generosity. Featuring a voice cameo from Alex Trebek as himself, "Miracle on Evergreen Terrace" was first aired on December 21, 1997(n)</desc>

Lisa Simpson (voice of Yeardley Smith) and her brother Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright) are among the students at Springfield Elementary who take part in the school's Model United Nations program, and along with their classmates they board a bus for a mock UN conference being held in a neighboring town. The rattletrap bus runs off a bridge into the river below, and a freak wave sends the vehicle off to sea. Bus driver Otto (voice of Harry Shearer) is washed away, but the students arrive safely on a deserted island. The kids soon realize they'll have to fend for themselves until a rescue team arrives, and realizing there isn't much food on the island, they'll be forced to make do with the snacks left on the bus. Millhouse (voice of Pamela Hayden) is chosen to guard the food, but come morning, the snacks are gone and Millhouse claims a monster stole them. No one is willing to believe Millhouse, and as order breaks down, the kids devolve into a band of feral savages. Meanwhile back at home, Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) decides to start a home business to make some extra money, and launches an internet firm that seems ready to pay off when it attracts the attention of Bill Gates. "Das Bus" also features narration from guest performer James Earl Jones; the episode was first aired on February 15, 1998(n)</desc>

Lisa Simpson (voice of Yeardley Smith) has been looking forward to seeing a special exhibit of rare Egyptian lore at the Springtonian Museum called "the Treasures of Isis," and her mother Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) promises to take her on the show's final day. However, Marge's plans change when Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright) comes home with various items from "Yuk-ingham Palace," the neighborhood novelty shop, super-glued to his face and she has to take him to the doctor. While Marge insists Lisa must stay home, Lisa tricks her easily misled father Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) into giving his permission for her to take the bus to the museum. But Lisa misreads the schedule and ends up on the outskirts of Springfield, and she flies into a panic when she ends up in the city's Russian district. When Homer and Marge realize Lisa is lost, Homer leaps into action to find her, though his actions make a difficult situation all the more complicated.

    <title lang="en">Midnight Cowboy</title>
    <desc lang="en">Joe Buck (John Voight) is the naive Texas dishwasher who leaves his tiny town for a life as a male prostitute in New York City. He quits his job and gets on a northbound bus. The rural rube encounters the brassy Cass (Sylvia Miles) and believes he has his first paying customer, but the Jewish princess brings out the crying towel in mock humiliation. Joe ends up giving her money for cab fare as his experience foreshadows other demoralizing events. He meets local street hustler Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) who relieves Joe of some more cash and sends him to the demented religious fanatic O'Daniel (John McGiver). Joe is horrified to learn O'Daniel is not a pimp and flees his seedy apartment. Wandering the cold, lonely streets, Joe is amazed that a dead man on the sidewalk draws no attention or interest from the locals. He meets up with the conniving Ratso and threatens to kill him if he doesn't return the money. Ratso gives Joe a place to stay in a condemned apartment building where the two scrounge for survival as winter approaches. Joe is reduced to allowing himself to be used for homosexual sex and a young college student fails to pay for his services. Ratso and Joe attend a trendy, drug soaked Manhattan party where he meets the stoned Shirley (Brenda Vaccaro), who pays Joe double the asking price for his sexual services. Ratso is already a cripple who finds his health worsening with the arrival of winter. Joe returns Ratso's kindness by vowing to take the ailing petty thief to Miami. While Ratso dreams of sun, fun and bikini clad women, Joe encounters a simpering, middle-aged homosexual from Chicago in town for a convention. He asks the man for money but is far short of the amount needed for two-one way trips to Florida on the Greyhound bus. Joe knocks out the man's dentures and sticks telephone receiver down the man's throat. By now Ratso is convinced he will be preyed upon in the mean streets of New York if he doesn't get to warm weather soon. Midnight Cowboy won the Oscar for Best Picture, Best screenplay (Waldo Salt) and Best Director (John Schlesinger). Hoffman, Voight, and Miles were nominated for their performances. Fred Neil's song "Everybody's Talking" was a smash for Nillson. Warren Zevon wrote a song, and The Group and Elephant's Memory also contributed to the memorable soundtrack. The film was rated X at the time and it the only X rated feature to win the Academy Award(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Actor-turned-director and producer Griffin Dunne (Practical Magic, Addicted to Love) teams up with scenarist Dirk Wittenborn for the slice-of-life ensemble drama Fierce People. As summer encroaches, 16-year-old Manhattanite Finn Earl (Anton Yelchin) would love nothing more than to trek off to South America and spend the year's sun-drenched months near the equator, embarking on thrilling adventures with his estranged archaeologist father, whom he's never met. Alas, the bonds of family rein in tight when Finn's booze- and coke-addled mother, the masseuse Liz (Diane Lane), cries out for help -- and, in the process, unwittingly gets Finn arrested. In a dramatic attempt to reverse circumstances and sort out the complications in both of their lives, Liz insists on taking custody of Finn for the summer. Both, she insists, will live in the home of one of her former massage clients, the aging billionaire Ogden C. Osborne (Donald Sutherland) -- with whom she may be amorously involved. Though Finn agrees begrudgingly at first, in time he finds the environment welcoming -- as he develops a crush on Ogden's gorgeous granddaughter (Kristen Stewart) and befriends Ogden's grandson. But when an unforeseen and shocking act of violence erupts, it estranges Finn and Liz from their posh surroundings and provides a sobering, harrowing reminder of the socioeconomic differences between the Earls and their new friends(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Fierce People</title>
    <desc lang="en">Actor-turned-director and producer Griffin Dunne (Practical Magic, Addicted to Love) teams up with scenarist Dirk Wittenborn for the slice-of-life ensemble drama Fierce People. As summer encroaches, 16-year-old Manhattanite Finn Earl (Anton Yelchin) would love nothing more than to trek off to South America and spend the year's sun-drenched months near the equator, embarking on thrilling adventures with his estranged archaeologist father, whom he's never met. Alas, the bonds of family rein in tight when Finn's booze- and coke-addled mother, the masseuse Liz (Diane Lane), cries out for help -- and, in the process, unwittingly gets Finn arrested. In a dramatic attempt to reverse circumstances and sort out the complications in both of their lives, Liz insists on taking custody of Finn for the summer. Both, she insists, will live in the home of one of her former massage clients, the aging billionaire Ogden C. Osborne (Donald Sutherland) -- with whom she may be amorously involved. Though Finn agrees begrudgingly at first, in time he finds the environment welcoming -- as he develops a crush on Ogden's gorgeous granddaughter (Kristen Stewart) and befriends Ogden's grandson. But when an unforeseen and shocking act of violence erupts, it estranges Finn and Liz from their posh surroundings and provides a sobering, harrowing reminder of the socioeconomic differences between the Earls and their new friends(n)</desc>

For decades, when children have a bad day, they have turned to the pages of Judith Viorst's hilarious book Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day for consolation. A multiple award-winning video from Sony Wonder, Alexander is the story of a boy whose day just keeps getting worse from the moment he wakes up with gum in his hair. He fights with his brother, breaks his favorite toy, gets in trouble with his parents, and with each mishap, he proclaims "That's it. I'm moving to Australia!" But at the end of the story, Alexander's mom reminds him that everyone has days like this -- even in Australia. This is a great learning tool to teach young children about dealing with anger and the unpredictability of life. Recommended for ages three to seven. This video has received the following awards: Bronze Medal -- Houston International Film &amp; Video Festival, Bronze Apple -- National Educational Film &amp; Video Festival, Bronze Plaque -- Columbus International Film &amp; Video Festival, and the Parents' Choice Award(n)</desc>

Casey Carlyle (Michelle Trachtenberg) is a high-school student who has a keen mind for math and looks to be on the fast track to Harvard, which is just the way her mother (Joan Cusack) wants it. However, Casey also has a dream of becoming a competitive ice skater, which is not a popular notion with either Casey's mom or her school's clique of aspiring skaters, led by the egocentric Gen (Hayden Panettiere). However, one day at the rink Casey wins the attention of Tina (Kim Cattrall), a former skating champion who now trains her daughter and is trying to live down an incident that grounded her career on the ice. Tina thinks Casey has what it takes to be a champ, but neither Gen nor Casey's mother are happy with this news, leaving Casey and Tina to go it alone, though Casey soon wins the emotional support of Teddy (Trevor Blumas), Gen's handsome older brother. Ice Princess also features champion skater Michelle Kwan in a small role as herself, doing television commentary at a skating event(n)</desc>

National Lampoon's Van Wilder revolves around the exploits of its title character (Ryan Reynolds), a seventh-year senior who's made it his goal in life to help each and every Coolidge College undergrad succeed in life -- or at least in bed. Van's charmed life seems to have an expiration date, however; his father (Tim Matheson) has cut off his presumably vast allowance. Financial insecurity doesn't phase the big man on campus, and he soon starts up a lucrative cottage industry as a planner of high-priced campus blowouts. When an enterprising reporter from the college paper gets wind of Van's liberal interpretation of the school's code of conduct, it seems his gig is up -- unless, of course, he can charm the hard-edged Gwen (Tara Reid) into accepting his uniquely skewed world view. In addition to Matheson, Van Wilder features cameos from a number of '80s teen movie stalwarts, including Edie McClurg, Paul Gleason, and Erik Estrada(n)</desc>

Worried and distracted, he makes a grave error of judgement, and suddenly finds himself struggling to cover his tracks. Meanwhile, Sam finds herself on the receiving end of Christine's wrath over a malicious rumour.

    <sub-title lang="en">Home</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Home. Ken Burns' celebrated baseball documentary has come full circle, from the black-and-white images of the game's beginnings to the full color of the modern era. Ken Burns' Baseball: Inning 9 -- Home, the final episode, deals with such threats to our national pastime as drug use by players, the egos of players and owners such as Reggie Jackson and George Steinbrenner, sky-rocketing salaries, and Pete Rose's banishment for gambling. But it also relives such moments as Hank Aaron breaking Babe Ruth's home run record, Carlton Fisk keeping the ball fair at Fenway with his body language, and Ken Griffey Sr. and Ken Griffey Jr. hitting back-to-back home runs in a game. Jackie Robinson's funeral is also covered in this episode, as Burns continues to pay tribute to the man who broke baseball's color barrier(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Winged Seduction: Birds of Paradise</title>
    <desc lang="en">National Geographic photographer Tim Laman and ornithologist Ed Scholes have spent the better part of a decade sleeping in tents and dangling from the rain forest canopy to document all 39 species of Birds of Paradise. Their mission takes them into the jungles of one of last wild places on earth, New Guinea - where children carry machetes, women carry heavy loads and men carry on tribal warfare. Far-flung islands, impenetrable jungle and extreme elevations all create areas of isolation where ordinary birds have evolved into some of the most beautifully bizarre species on earth. Tim and Ed's first quarry on this expedition is Goldie's Bird of Paradise - a dazzling color-shaker that attracts females with a mating dance done in pairs. Rough seas, a flooded island and inaccurate scouting all stand in their way, but Tim and Ed make natural history filmmaking history by capturing a Goldie display with a remote controlled camouflaged camera. After a wild flight into the Huon Mountains, they search out Wahne's Parotia, a shape-shifter that transforms from bird to a feathered man in a skirt. Tim and Ed are after a scientific first - filming the Parotia from the female's perspective. Feathers that look like a skirt from the side, look like an oval from above, where the female audience members sit - no human has ever filmed it before. Digital explorers on an old-fashioned quest, Tim and Ed have survived everything the jungle has to throw at them to become first in the world to capture all 39 species of Birds of Paradise(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The recovery of a stolen gun leads the team to reinvestigate the death 40 years previously of Jacob Tarlow, a Jewish officer who was involved in recruiting black Americans into the navy in the 1970s. Tarlow had been targeted by Ku Klux Klan members and was found hanged from a tree, but the death was ruled as suicide. The reappearance of the victim's sidearm is enough evidence to reopen the case and the team is led to Tom Hamilton, an ex-police officer who it is claimed was involved in the attack.

Jim (Jason Biggs) is about to marry Michelle, while his crazy friends, Finch, Stifler and Kevin, still have their hormones somewhat worked up. Apart from rushing to make all the arrangements for the wedding, Jim must strive to gain the approval of his parents-in-law, and, to make matters worse, he has to battle with the restrictions of his grandmother, who is against the wedding because Michelle is not Jewish. In addition, the arrival of Cadence, the bride's youngest sister, completely upsets the situation. Finch and Stifler fall in love with her and start a heated dispute, where one of them is the rebel, and the other, prince charming. Of course, a crazy stag party could not be left out.

    <title lang="en">Casino Royale</title>
    <desc lang="en">Actor Daniel Craig assumes the role formerly occupied by such screen greats as Sean Connery, Roger Moore, and Timothy Dalton to set out on the character's very first 007 mission. James Bond has earned his "00" status by masterfully executing a pair of death-defying professional assassinations. Now assigned the task of traveling to Madagascar to spy on notorious terrorist Mollaka (Sebastien Foucan) for his maiden voyage as a 007 agent, Bond boldly goes against MI6 policy to launch an independent investigation that finds him traversing the Bahamas in search of Mollaka's notoriously elusive terror cell. Subsequently led into the company of the mysterious Dimitrios (Simon Abkarian) and his exotic girlfriend, Solange (Caterina Murino), Bond soon realizes that he is closer than ever to locating well-guarded terrorist financier Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), the man who has personally bankrolled some of the most prevalent terrorist organizations on the planet. When Bond learns that Le Chiffre is planning to partake in an upcoming high-stakes poker game to be played at Montenegro's Le Casino Royale and use the winnings to establish his financial grip on the globe, M (Judi Dench) assigns beguiling agent Vesper (Eva Green) the task of watching over the fledgling agent as he plays against Le Chiffre in a covert attempt to destroy the nefarious gambler's well-established monetary stronghold in the underworld once and for all. Bond will need more than his legendary gambling skills in order to win this dangerous game, though, and after allying himself with local MI6 field agent Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini) and CIA operative Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright), the endlessly suave super-spy puts on his poker face for a high-stakes game of cards in which the stakes are not measured in dollars, but human lives(n)</desc>

Stine's Goosebumps series, this made-for-TV vampire tale stars Chauncey Leopardi as Zach, a teenage rebel with a flair for telling ghost stories, who stumbles on an underground cabal of vampires when he takes a fateful ride on a New York subway. The vampire's leader, Valentine (Ron Silver), proposes a deal to young Zach, offering him safe passage to the world above, thus enabling the trapped vampire -- who can only mingle with humanity through the willing assistance of an innocent youth -- to reach the surface as well. Our young hero balks at this idea and escapes to the surface with a wild story for his skeptical pals, who shun him until one of their number is kidnapped by the undead subway dwellers in exchange for Zach's cooperation. Though atmospherically photographed, this low-budget production is a bit too corny to provide either laughs or chills, and it suffers further from lethargic pacing(n)</desc>

Jim (Jason Biggs) is about to marry Michelle, while his crazy friends, Finch, Stifler and Kevin, still have their hormones somewhat worked up. Apart from rushing to make all the arrangements for the wedding, Jim must strive to gain the approval of his parents-in-law, and, to make matters worse, he has to battle with the restrictions of his grandmother, who is against the wedding because Michelle is not Jewish. In addition, the arrival of Cadence, the bride's youngest sister, completely upsets the situation. Finch and Stifler fall in love with her and start a heated dispute, where one of them is the rebel, and the other, prince charming. Of course, a crazy stag party could not be left out.

An unexpected assignation between stepsiblings Mamie and Charley results in Mamie becoming pregnant, with the child being put up for adoption shortly after birth. Twenty years later, Mamie (Lisa Kudrow) is approached by Nicky (Jesse Bradford), an aspiring filmmaker with an abrasive personality who claims to know where her long-lost son is living. However, there's a catch -- Nicky wants to shoot the reunion for the student film he's working on, and won't tell her about her child unless she agrees, though her lover, Javier (Bobby Cannavale), attempts to work out a compromise. Meanwhile, Charley (Steve Coogan), now out of the closet, has a longstanding relationship with Gil (David Sutcliffe), and the couple are involved in a legal battle over whether or not Gil's donated sperm produced a baby who has been adopted by a lesbian couple they know (Laura Dern and Sarah Clarke). And finally, Jude (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is a bohemian malcontent who becomes involved with Otis (Jason Ritter), a sexually ambiguous rock musician. Otis has a difficult relationship with his father, Frank (Tom Arnold), but when Jude meets Frank, she likes him fine -- in fact, she soon falls in love with him and leaves Otis for his dad. Happy Endings had its world premiere at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival(n)</desc>

Avila suspects something about Peck from the beginning; his influence and dominance over others seems to extend further than the reach of his badge. When officers who wish to testify against Peck start dying, the depth of his corruption becomes increasingly clear; at his disposal, he has an army of cops and criminals alike. He even agrees to assassinate a sleazy businessman's own parents, and humiliates the businessman while they make the deal. In his drive to dominate others, Peck attempts to seduce almost every woman around him and is obsessed with children and fatherhood.

Alex agrees to become Tommy's protégé, and together the pair wins every tournament they enter. But Alex's attraction to beautiful Las Vegas call girl Michelle (Shannon Elizabeth) has caused his attention shift away from the tables, and that distraction has opened up a deep chasm between the emerging talent and the undisputed master. Later, after Alex and Tommy call off their partnership, they find themselves on opposite sides of the table at the prestigious World Poker Tour. Who will take the top prize? Will it be the old pro who promised he would never gamble again or the newcomer who learned all of his tricks from the true master of the trade?(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Hot Rod</title>
    <desc lang="en">Akiva Schaffer's slapstick comedy stars Andy Samberg as Rod Kimble, a daredevil motorcycle stunt rider in the mould of Evel Knievel. Well, not quite - most of his stunts end in disaster and he lives as home with his stepdad Frank Powell and mum Marie. But, when his overbearing stepfather needs $50,000 for a heart operation, Rod swears to raise the cash somehow. Initial efforts, including a stint as a children's entertainer and as a daredevil show at the local swimming pool, end in abject failure. But Rod, unbowed, goes for the big one: he aims to jump 15 school buses (one more than Knievel). Samberg is an alumnus of Saturday Night Live, and the show's wacky humour translates well to this picaresque comedy that never flags(n)</desc>

The family's domestic tranquility is shattered when the 3,000-year-old mummified corpse of Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), which has been shipped to the British Museum, is resurrected once again to resume his evil quest for immortality. In the meantime, another ancient threat emerges in the form of the Scorpion King (professional wrestler Dwayne Johnson, aka. the Rock), a mighty warrior frozen in time with his supernatural army. In order to save his family, Rick is forced to seek a mythical pyramid of gold, facing marauding bands of pygmy skeletons, among other hazards.

    <desc lang="en">In this drama that explores greed and corruption in American business, Giovanni Ribisi plays Seth Davis, an intelligent and ambitious college dropout who runs a casino in his apartment. Eager to show his father that he can succeed, Seth lands a job with a small stock brokerage firm. He is given a space in the company's "boiler room," where he makes cold calls to prospective clients. As it turns out, Seth has a genuine talent for cold calling, which gains him the approval of his superiors, the admiration of his father, and the attentions of one of his co-workers, Abby Hilliard (Nia Long). However, the higher up the ladder Seth rises, the deeper he sinks into a quagmire of dirty dealings, until he's breaking the law in order to keep his bosses happy and his paychecks coming. The Boiler Room also features Tom Everett Scott, Scott Caan, Jamie Kennedy, Nicky Katt, and Ben Affleck in a cameo as the headhunter who brings Seth into the firm. Ribisi and Scott also appeared together in That Thing You Do; Ribisi was the drummer replaced by Scott, who then led The One-Ders to fictional pop stardom(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Where Do We Go Now?</title>
    <desc lang="en">Women try to persuade their men to put a stop to war in this fusion of comedy and drama from director, screenwriter, and actress Nadine Labaki. Amale (Labaki) runs a café in a small Lebanese village where the local women, both Christian and Muslim, get together to talk, swap ideas, and share grief as the number who've lost sons or husbands in frequent skirmishes continues to grow. The fighting between religious and political factions has been going on for years, and one day Amale and her friends Afaf (Layla Hakim), Saydeh (Antoinette Noufaily), Takla (Claude Baz Moussawbaa), and Yvonne (Yvonne Maalouf) decide it's time to stop talking about the fighting and do something to bring it to a halt. The local women join forces to distract their men, convinced if they put their minds on other things they won't worry so much about killing. Their efforts range from serving hashish-laced baked goods at a community get-together to hiring Ukrainian dancers to show off their charms to the menfolk. After a young man is killed in a gun battle, the women realize they need to take a stronger stand if they intend to make their home safe again; meanwhile, Christian Amale unwittingly strikes a blow for religious unity when she falls for handsome Muslim Rabih (Julien Farhat). Et Maintenant On Va Ou? (aka Where Do We Go Now?) won the People's Choice Award at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival(n)</desc>

But someone has beaten Durell and LeeJohn to the punch, and if they ever hope to get their hands on that quick cash, this bumbling pair will first have to spend an entire night in the presence of not just the almighty lord, but some of his most fervent followers as well.

    <desc lang="en">Barry W Blaustein's comedy, produced by the Farrelly Brothers, stars Johnny Knoxville as Steve Barker, a low level executive who needs to raise money for his uninsured gardener, who was crippled in an accident. Steve's uncle Gary, who is in debt to the mob, has an idea that will solve both their problems: Steve will enter and win at the Special Olympics and Gary will make a fortune betting on him. Feigning learning difficulties, Steve, now calling himself Jeffy Dahmer, joins the team, but his fellow competitors aren't fooled for a moment. Admiring his chutzpah, they keep quiet, and Jeffy also embarks on a romance with volunteer Lynn Sheridan. What could have been an exercise in poor taste rises above it because it treats the characters with both affection and respect, showing the Special Olympians as engaging and humorous individuals and largely poking fun at Gary and Steve(n)</desc>

In 3028, after the Earth is destroyed by an invading alien race, a tiny number of surviving humans roam the universe in ragtag spaceships, trying to find each other and maintain some sense of community. Shortly before the final destruction of the planet, Cale (voice of Matt Damon) was given a map that would guide him to a space station called Titan, secretly constructed as a last hope in the event of alien Armageddon.

Up till recently, Pete Bell has been a winning coach for Western U's basketball team. But this year has been different. The film opens with the coach ripping into the team for another dreadful game. Bell knows that if his team continues to lose, he will lose his job. He has no choice but to recruit more talent. He begins his search for better players and finds three good prospects: Chicago player Butch Hardaway, an accurate shooter; Ricky, an enormously tall boy form French Lick, Indiana; and Neon, a temperamental giant. Together these three offer unbeatable potential if he can get them to come to Western. But it's not easy. The first two make exorbitant demands involving a lot of cash, new homes, and farm equipment. Neon asks for nothing but gets a new luxury car. Coach Pete is already dealing with allegations of shadiness and does not want to give in, but he is forced to by the alumni organization leader.

Thirteen-year-old Claire (Emma Roberts) and same-aged Hailey (Joanne "JoJo" Levesque) are two close friends living in Tampa, FL, who are facing a separation in a few weeks -- Claire's mother is a marine biologist who has been given a prestigious new job in Australia, meaning the girls are not likely to see much of each other again. While the girls wonder if there's anything they can do to avoid the inevitable, a storm breaks out and the waves toss an unusual example of sea life into Hailey's swimming pool -- Aquamarine (Sara Paxton), a teenaged mermaid who has some problems of her own. Aquamarine's father is a leader of the undersea world who has arranged for his daughter to marry a boy whom she doesn't care for. It seems Dad doesn't put much stock in the land-locked notion of love, and unless Aquamarine can prove to him that it's real, she will have to go through with the wedding. Claire and Hailey find Aquamarine, and discover that she fortunately sprouts legs when on dry land during the daylight hours; after learning of her romantic dilemma, they decide to help her by teaching her how to turn the head of Raymond (Jake McDorman), a cute lifeguard at the nearby beach. However, pretty Aquamarine learns her lessons well enough to make Cecilia (Arielle Kebbel), a mean girl with a crush on Raymond, jealous, leading her into a battle over the young man's affections, which Aquamarine has to win if she wants to avoid a loveless marriage. Aquamarine was the first feature film from director Elizabeth Allen(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The filmmaking trio behind the hit sci-fi sequel Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines re-team to explore a future in which humans live in isolation while only communicating with their fellow man through robots that serve as social surrogates and are better-looking versions of their human counterparts. Bruce Willis stars as an FBI agent who enlists the aid of his own surrogate to investigate the murder of the genius college student who invented the surrogates. As the case grows more complicated, however, the withdrawn detective discovers that in order to actually catch the killer he will have to venture outside the safety of his own home for the first time in many years, and enlists the aid of another agent (Radha Mitchell) in tracking his target down. Jonathan Mostow directs co-screenwriters Michael Ferris and John Brancato's adaptation of the graphic novel by author Robert Venditti and illustrator Brett Weldele(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">To Serve Man</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">To Serve Man. Everybody knows the "punchline" of this classic Twilight Zone episode, but that doesn't make this entry any less entertaining. Told in flashback (a last-minute decision, judging by the original script), this is the story of the Kanamints, a race of giant space aliens who arrive on Earth, ostensibly on a mission of goodwill. The Kanamints offer all manner of scientific advancements; all they ask in exchange is that the earthlings trust them without question. Meanwhile, a team of scientists, headed by Dr. Chambers (Lloyd Bochner), work day and night to translate a Kanamint book, the title of which is, of course, "To Serve Man." Richard Kiel, the 7-foot-plus actor who gained fame as "Jaws" in the James Bond series, appears as the Kanamint leader (though his voice is dubbed by Marvin Miller. Scripted by Rod Serling from a short story by Damon Knight, "To Serve Man" was originally telecast March 2, 1962(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">The Last Rites of Jeff Myrtlebank</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The Last Rites of Jeff Myrtlebank. Writer-director Montgomery Pittman's final Twilight Zone offering was the bucolic comedy "The Last Rites of Jeff Myrtlebank." As the youthful title character (James Best) lies in his coffin during his funeral, the assembled mourners listen to the droning words of the local pastor (William Fawcett) -- whereupon Jeff sits bolt upright, very much alive! Doc Bolton (Edgar Buchanan) assumes that he made a misdiagnosis when he declared Jeff dead, but the townsfolk are convinced that the boy has been possessed by the devil, especially after Jeff handily beats up his longtime antagonist Orgram Gatewood (Lance Fuller), something he has never been able to do before. Only Orgram's cousin Comfort (played by director Pittman's daughter-in-law Sherry Jackson) remains unafraid of Jeff, but even she begins to have her doubts during the diabolically amusing final scenes. Blessed with a semi-satirical harmonica score by Tommy Morgan, "The Last Rites of Jeff Myrtlebank" made its first TV appearance on February 23, 1962(n)</desc>

After a brief brouhaha involving a precious vial and a wild ride down a raging Himalyan river, Indy (Harrison Ford) gets down to the problem at hand: retrieving a precious gem and several kidnapped young boys on behalf of a remote East Indian village. His companions this time around include a dimbulbed, easily frightened nightclub chanteuse (Kate Capshaw), and a feisty 12-year-old kid named Short Round (Quan Ke Huy). Throughout, the plot takes second place to the thrills, which include a harrowing rollercoaster ride in an abandoned mineshaft and Indy's rescue of the heroine from a ritual sacrifice. There are also a couple of cute references to Raiders of the Lost Ark, notably a funny variation of Indy's shooting of the Sherpa warrior(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">When an evil oil man discovers black gold beneath Muppet Theater, Kermit recruits a Muppet super-fan and his two best friends to help gather up the gang for a telethon that will save the venue from being razed and replaced with a giant oil pump. Tex Richman (Chris Cooper) never met an oil field he couldn't suck dry. So when Tex discovers a bountiful reservoir right underneath Muppet Theater, he begins drawing up plans to claim the land and start drilling. Little does Tex realize that devoted Muppets fan Walter is currently in Los Angeles with his best friends Gary (Jason Segel) and Mary (Amy Adams), and that he's not about to let one man's greed spoil a good thing for everyone. With Kermit by their side, Walter, Gary, and Mary hatch a plan to put on a big telethon that will help them raise the ten million dollars needed to keep Muppet Theater standing. But rounding up the gang won't be easy, because these days Miss Piggy's got a posh job at Vogue Paris; Fozzie has landed a gig at a Reno casino; Gonzo has become the owner of a successful plumbing company; and Animal is dealing with anger management issues in a Santa Barbara clinic. With the drilling deadline fast drawing near and Tex wringing his hands in anticipation, the gang races to put on the performance of a lifetime and save Muppet Theater from certain destruction. Directed by James Bobin and written by Segel and Nicholas Stoller, The Muppets Movie features cameos by Zach Galifianakis, Billy Crystal, Jack Black, Alan Arkin, and Jean-Claude Van Damme, among others(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Wizard of Oz</title>
    <desc lang="en">Judy Garland stars in Victor Fleming's enduring, multi-layered, Technicolor musical masterpiece, based on L Frank Baum's 1900 novel. There can't be many people unfamiliar with the story of Dorothy, the girl who lives on a drab Kansas farm but gets blown away by a tornado to the vibrantly coloured, enchanting-but-perilous land of Oz. The film has stood the test of time, enthralling each new generation of children with its adventure narrative and bizarre characters; from the key trio of the Scarecrow, Cowardly Lion and the Tin Man, to the witches, wizards and Munchkins who populate this astonishing realm. And, for adults, there are Baum's economic and social messages, born out of harsh times, also to consider. However, there's only one question that really counts: can Dorothy evade the Wicked Witch of the West and make it back home with her beloved dog Toto? The movie was nominated for six Oscars, winning one for Best Music, Original Score and another for the song Somewhere Over the Rainbow. Also starring Billie Burke and Frank Morgan(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Pilot. April 5, 1987, was the historic day upon which the Fox network launched its first prime-time lineup with the highly controversial -- and incredibly successful -- situation comedy Married... With Children. The pilot episode wastes no time introducing the delightfully dysfunctional Bundy family of Chicago: Boorish shoe salesman Al Bundy (Ed O'Neill), his lazy, sex-obsessed wife Peg (Katey Sagal), and their worthless children, underachieving 11-year-old Bud (David Faustino) and promiscuous 15-year-old Kelly (Christina Applegate). In the opener, Peg insists that Al try to make friends with the Bundys' new next-door neighbors, simperingly sweet newlyweds Steve and Marcy Rhodes (David Garrison, Amanda Bearse) -- and in the process nearly destroy the young couple's marriage before it gets into first gear. Also on hand is Al's swinging-bachelor co-worker Luke Ventura (Ritch Shydner)(n)</desc>
