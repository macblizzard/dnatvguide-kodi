    <desc lang="en">Product designer Rebecca Sturrock has returned to her family home in Cornwall with her partner Gregory Kewish and a highly ambitious plan. Together they hope to transform a small, damp bungalow into a cutting-edge home to share with their twin three-year-old daughters - all for just £80,000. The design is radical - to reinforce the walls of the old property and add a new living space on top to take advantage of the views. This extra floor will be made entirely of thick wooden panels engineered in Germany and normally assembled by a crew of specialist installers. However, budget constraints mean the couple are determined to do it all themselves.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Super Orgasm</title>
    <desc lang="en">For most women multiple orgasms can seem almost mythical. But some can experience it not once, twice or even 10 times, but 60, 70 or 100 - a super-orgasm. In this documentary, a group of these women volunteer for a series of tests in a scientific investigation to reveal the truth behind the super-orgasm. The aim is to measure and record the phenomenon for the first time, finding out how the brain and the body react before, during and after, and asking if these women are wired differently to other people. And if not, is it something that could be learned by anyone?.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Capote</title>
    <desc lang="en">The creation of one of the most memorable books of the 1960s -- and the impact the writing and research would have on its author -- is explored in this drama based on a true story. In 1959, Truman Capote (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman) was a critically acclaimed novelist who had earned a small degree of celebrity for his work when he read a short newspaper item about a multiple murder in a small Kansas town. For some reason, the story fascinated Capote, and he asked William Shawn (Bob Balaban), his editor at The New Yorker, to let him write a piece about the case. Capote had long believed that in the right hands, a true story could be molded into a tale as compelling as any fiction, and he believed this event, in which the brutal and unimaginable was visited upon a community where it was least expected, could be just the right material. Capote traveled to Kansas with his close friend Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), herself becoming a major literary figure with the success of To Kill a Mockingbird, and while Capote's effete and mannered personal style stuck out like a sore thumb in Kansas, in time he gained the trust of Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper), the Kansas Bureau of Investigation agent investigating the murder of the Clutter family, and with his help Capote's magazine piece grew into a full-length book. Capote also became familiar with the petty criminals who killed the Clutter family, Dick Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) and Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.), and in Smith he found a troubling kindred spirit more like himself than he wanted to admit. After attaining a sort of friendship with Smith under the assumption that the man would be executed before the book was ever published, Capote finds himself forced to directly confront the moral implications of his actions with regards to both his role in the man's death, and the way that he would be remembered. Capote also co-stars Bruce Greenwood as Capote's longtime companion Jack Dunphy, and Amy Ryan as Mary Dewey, Alvin's wife who became a confidante of Capote's(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Television director Peter O'Fallon made his feature film debut with this independent film that pays obvious homage to the style of Quentin Tarantino, with plenty of violence and funny, talkative hit men. Suave gangster Charlie Barrett (Christopher Walken) meets four young men who have taken over his regular booth at a popular bistro. Charmed by the swaggering kids, he agrees to take a ride with them, but they give him a sedative and he awakens in a deserted mansion, taped to a chair with one of his fingers missing. One of his abductors, Avery (Henry Thomas), says that he has a sister who has been kidnapped and they need two million dollars to get her back, as well as a finger to exchange for her severed digit. Charlie phones his lawyer Marty (Cliff De Young), who calls a henchman, Lono (Denis Leary), who investigates the kidnappings and gives Charlie enough information to start playing each of his inexperienced abductors against the others(n)</desc>

Kenya's Eliud Kipchoge broke away from compatriot Stanley Biwot last year to claim victory in the men's race in a time just eight seconds shy of the world record, but he is likely to face stiff competition this year from Ethiopian track great Kenenisa Bekele. The women's event was also won by a Kenyan, with Jemima Sumgong recovering from a fall to edge out Ethiopia's Tigist Tufa by five seconds. In the wheelchair races, Great Britain's David Weir is aiming for a record seventh victory in what is set to be his final race, while America's Tatyana McFadden goes for her fifth straight title in the women's event. Commentary by Steve Cram, Brendan Foster, Andrew Cotter and Tanni Grey-Thompson, and reports from Colin Jackson, Steve Brown, Ore Oduba and Jazmin Sawyers.(n)</desc>

Kenya's Eliud Kipchoge broke away from compatriot Stanley Biwot last year to claim victory in the men's race in a time just eight seconds shy of the world record, but he is likely to face stiff competition this year from Ethiopian track great Kenenisa Bekele. The women's event was also won by a Kenyan, with Jemima Sumgong recovering from a fall to edge out Ethiopia's Tigist Tufa by five seconds. In the wheelchair races, Great Britain's David Weir is aiming for a record seventh victory in what is set to be his final race, while America's Tatyana McFadden goes for her fifth straight title in the women's event.

    <desc lang="en">Actor-turned-director and producer Griffin Dunne (Practical Magic, Addicted to Love) teams up with scenarist Dirk Wittenborn for the slice-of-life ensemble drama Fierce People. As summer encroaches, 16-year-old Manhattanite Finn Earl (Anton Yelchin) would love nothing more than to trek off to South America and spend the year's sun-drenched months near the equator, embarking on thrilling adventures with his estranged archaeologist father, whom he's never met. Alas, the bonds of family rein in tight when Finn's booze- and coke-addled mother, the masseuse Liz (Diane Lane), cries out for help -- and, in the process, unwittingly gets Finn arrested. In a dramatic attempt to reverse circumstances and sort out the complications in both of their lives, Liz insists on taking custody of Finn for the summer. Both, she insists, will live in the home of one of her former massage clients, the aging billionaire Ogden C. Osborne (Donald Sutherland) -- with whom she may be amorously involved. Though Finn agrees begrudgingly at first, in time he finds the environment welcoming -- as he develops a crush on Ogden's gorgeous granddaughter (Kristen Stewart) and befriends Ogden's grandson. But when an unforeseen and shocking act of violence erupts, it estranges Finn and Liz from their posh surroundings and provides a sobering, harrowing reminder of the socioeconomic differences between the Earls and their new friends(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Actor-turned-director and producer Griffin Dunne (Practical Magic, Addicted to Love) teams up with scenarist Dirk Wittenborn for the slice-of-life ensemble drama Fierce People. As summer encroaches, 16-year-old Manhattanite Finn Earl (Anton Yelchin) would love nothing more than to trek off to South America and spend the year's sun-drenched months near the equator, embarking on thrilling adventures with his estranged archaeologist father, whom he's never met. Alas, the bonds of family rein in tight when Finn's booze- and coke-addled mother, the masseuse Liz (Diane Lane), cries out for help -- and, in the process, unwittingly gets Finn arrested. In a dramatic attempt to reverse circumstances and sort out the complications in both of their lives, Liz insists on taking custody of Finn for the summer. Both, she insists, will live in the home of one of her former massage clients, the aging billionaire Ogden C. Osborne (Donald Sutherland) -- with whom she may be amorously involved. Though Finn agrees begrudgingly at first, in time he finds the environment welcoming -- as he develops a crush on Ogden's gorgeous granddaughter (Kristen Stewart) and befriends Ogden's grandson. But when an unforeseen and shocking act of violence erupts, it estranges Finn and Liz from their posh surroundings and provides a sobering, harrowing reminder of the socioeconomic differences between the Earls and their new friends(n)</desc>

If he fails, robots will eliminate humans in a war. Mr. Garrison, now teaching kindergarten, holds a class election that quickly spins out of control after one student is unable to commit to a candidate. That student's name -- Florida. "Trapper Keeper" is highlighted by parodies of 2001 and Akira, and debuted November 15, 2000, on Comedy Central(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Crime of Passion: The Pamela Smart Story. Youth, seduction, and violence populate the landscape of the A&amp;E program American Justice: Crimes of Passion -- The Pamela Smart Story. As an attractive motivated schoolteacher, Pam Smart was carving out a successful middle-class life. But, inwardly, she was passionately dissatisfied. Her husband held her back, yet she couldn't afford to live alone. Then, Smart met teenager Bill Flynn. He fell for her and she seemed flattered by the attention. Eventually, their relationship became intimate and Smart found the answer to all her problems. Through manipulation and claims of abuse, she convinced her young lover to kill her husband and that's just what he did with the help of two friends. But, Smart's calculating manner gave her away when police suspected her of being less than grief-stricken. What followed was the first live broadcast trial in history. The media explosion surrounding the case was unparalleled. Smart turned out to be a lot less organized than she thought. When her killers caved and word got around of her arranged hit, she was doomed. A&amp;E takes the viewer back to the original trial of the century(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">No Strings Attached</title>
    <desc lang="en">Lifelong friends Adam (Ashton Kutcher) and Emma (Natalie Portman) attempt to avoid falling in love after falling into each other's beds in this comedy exploring the complexities and quirks of having friends with benefits. Adam was a typical, hormonal 14-year-old when he first came on to Emma at summer camp -- and got shot down in flames. In the years that followed, however, Adam and Emma continued to cross paths until, eventually, they both caved to their animal instincts. Despite an intense session of earth-shaking sex, however, Emma makes it clear to Adam that the last thing she wants is a committed relationship. And thanks to the fact that Adam's father (Kevin Kline), a fallen television star, has just begun dating his son's ex-girlfriend, the horrified bachelor has developed an aversion to monogamy as well. At first their casual stance on sex works great for both; Emma can focus on her career instead of allowing her emotions to dictate her decisions, and Adam can play the field without fear of hurting her feelings. Over time, though, a funny thing happens -- Adam begins to develop feelings for Emma that he never had for any of his countless conquests. Before they both know it, love has reared its ugly head and they've gotten too emotionally involved to cut the relationship off cold. But is commitment in the cards for the couple that always swore it would never get serious, or has the time come for them to finally part ways once and for all?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Touted upon its release as the finale of the Rocky saga, this fifth entry in the long-running series of sports dramas reunites star Sylvester Stallone with John G. Avildsen, director of the Oscar-winning original. Stallone is Rocky Balboa, suffering from career-ending brain damage as a result of his punishing bout with Ivan Drago at the finale of the previous film. Upon their return to Philadelphia, Rocky and his wife, Adrian (Talia Shire), discover they are broke, their fortune squandered by an incompetent accountant. Forced to move back to their working-class neighborhood, Rocky finds that his only asset is the run-down gym willed to him by Mickey (Burgess Meredith, who appears in new flashback sequences). Resisting big money offered to him by Don King-like boxing promoter George Washington Duke (Richard Gant), Rocky becomes a trainer and finds a talented comer in Tommy Gunn (real-life boxer Tommy Morrison, nephew of John Wayne). Rocky's son (played by Stallone's real-life son Sage Stallone) feels neglected by his father, who lavishes attention on his protégé, but Tommy ultimately turns his back on his mentor to sign a more lucrative deal with Duke, leading to a street-fight showdown(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">District 9</title>
    <desc lang="en">Neill Blomkamp's debut feature is a thoughtful sci-fi thriller about aliens stranded on Earth, which tells a social parable that couldn't be more apposite to its South African setting. Back in the early 80s a spaceship grinds to a halt above Johannesburg. On investigation, the colossal craft is found to house insect-like bipeds, all in a very bad shape. Eventually allowed to land on the planet, the occupants are confined to District 9, a shabby outlying suburb. Now, around 20 years later, the entire population of 'prawns', as the aliens have offensively been labelled, are to be moved to a distant detention camp, with Afrikaner bureaucrat Wikus van de Merwe placed in charge of their relocation. But when a grim accident befalls van de Merwe, he's given a radically different perspective on the affair, as well as little choice but to team up with the extra-terrestrials. Mixing elements of horror and action-thriller into the allegorical whole, the Oscar- and BAFTA-nominated fantasy, produced by Peter Jackson, uses top-notch CGI to both create a believable setting and to move the pace along nicely. In English, with subtitles for the dialogue in Afrikaans, Nyanja, Zulu, Xhosa, Sotho and the aliens' language(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Lisa's First Word. Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) and his wife, Marge (voice of Julie Kavner), are trying to prompt baby Maggie to say her first word one day, which leads both Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright) and Lisa (voice of Yeardley Smith) to ask what their first words were. Bart's first word involves something neither Homer or Marge want to discuss with the kids, but they do have a story about how Lisa learned to speak. It's 1983, and Marge, mother of a bundle of manic energy called Bart, learns she's expecting another baby. Homer decides its time they move out of their crowded flat on Springfield's Lower East Side and find a house of their own, and while this puts a strain on their budget, Homer does find himself the beneficiary of a windfall of a sort -- after the Soviet Union opts to boycott the 1984 Olympic Games, thousands of game tickets at Krusty Burger unexpectedly become winners, filling the Simpson dinner table for free. Once Lisa is born, Bart becomes extremely jealous of the new arrival, and eventually decides to run away from home. Lisa, however, loves her big brother, and Bart finally warms up to her once she says her first words. "Lisa's First Word" first aired on December 3, 1992; the episode also features a brief vocal cameo from Elizabeth Taylor(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Lisa the Vegetarian. During a visit to a petting zoo, Lisa Simpson (voice of Yeardley Smith) makes friends with a baby lamb, and suffers a crisis of conscience that evening when her mother, Marge (voice of Julie Kavner), serves lamb chops for dinner. Lisa decides she can no longer morally accept eating animals, and becomes a vegetarian, which doesn't go over especially well with her father, noted pork enthusiast Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta). When Homer decides to throw a big barbecue to spite his neighbor Ned Flanders (voice of Harry Shearer), Lisa tries to convince him to make it a vegetarian cookout, but Homer isn't about to give up meat for his shindig. When Lisa liberates the roast pig that was to be the main course at the barbecue, Lisa and Homer have a major falling out, but she soon discovers another passionate vegetarian in Springfield -- convenience store magnate Apu (voice of Hank Azaria) -- who introduces Lisa to his longtime friends Paul and Linda McCartney (who provide their own voices) while passing along a lesson about tolerance. "Lisa the Vegetarian" also featured a guest appearance by Phil Hartman as Troy McClure, who narrates the educational film ''Meat and You: Partners in Freedom." Paul McCartney's appearance made him the last of the surviving Beatles to pop up on the show, appropriately in an episode which championed one of his favorite causes, vegetarianism.

    <title lang="en">127 Hours</title>
    <desc lang="en">Danny Boyle's part Film4-funded, multi Oscar- and BAFTA-nominated, fact-based drama stars James Franco as a mountain climber who gets himself into a desperate predicament. When adrenaline junkie Aaron Ralston (Franco) sets off to conquer a canyon in the stunning landscape of a Utah national park, he has no idea quite how bad a day he's in for. His trip starts out well enough, bumping into Kristi (Kate Mara) and Megan (Amber Tamblyn), a couple of foxy female hikers, but it starts its inexorable decline when he heads off to tackle Blue John Canyon - solo, with no means of communication on him and without telling anyone his plans. So, when he quickly and irreversibly gets his arm stuck under a rock, he's utterly on his own. All he's carrying is a miniscule supply of food and water and - crucially - a small multi-tool. During the 127 hours he's pinned to the canyon wall, Ralston weighs his options, mentally replays the key points of his life and loves, drifts into delirium, and, finally, summons the sheer grit and force of will needed to commit the act that could give him a slim chance of survival. And the squeamish may need to look away and plug their ears when he does so!(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">John Irving scripted this screen adaptation of his 1985 novel. Set during World War II, The Cider House Rules concerns Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire), an orphan who spent most of his childhood at the St. Cloud Orphanage in rural Maine, where he grew up under the strong but affectionate care of Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine). Larch has passed along his medical education to Homer, and the young man helps the doctor care for abandoned children and the newborn babies of unwed mothers; however, Homer refuses to assist Larch with the illegal abortions that he performs on the side; Homer has moral objections to abortion, while Larch believes in the rights of the individual and sees it as his duty to keep women in need away from dangerous incompetents. Wally Worthington (Paul Rudd), an air-force pilot, brings his girlfriend Candy (Charlize Theron) to St. Cloud for an abortion, and Homer decides to go with them when they leave, hoping to see the world; however, the three end up going no further than the state line, where Wally's mother (Kate Nelligan) runs an apple orchard and cider mill, and Candy's family traps lobsters. When Wally ships off to battle, Homer grows closer to Candy, and the two fall in love. But their idyllic life at the cider mill is interrupted when Rose Rose (Erykah Badu), a field worker at the orchard, becomes pregnant and her father, cider-house foreman Mr. Rose (Delroy Lindo), turns out to be the father of her unborn child. This news coupled with the death of Dr. Larch, forces Homer to take a long look at both his moral principles and his future. Rapper Heavy D appears in the supporting cast as Peaches(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Cider House Rules</title>
    <desc lang="en">John Irving scripted this screen adaptation of his 1985 novel. Set during World War II, The Cider House Rules concerns Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire), an orphan who spent most of his childhood at the St. Cloud Orphanage in rural Maine, where he grew up under the strong but affectionate care of Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine). Larch has passed along his medical education to Homer, and the young man helps the doctor care for abandoned children and the newborn babies of unwed mothers; however, Homer refuses to assist Larch with the illegal abortions that he performs on the side; Homer has moral objections to abortion, while Larch believes in the rights of the individual and sees it as his duty to keep women in need away from dangerous incompetents. Wally Worthington (Paul Rudd), an air-force pilot, brings his girlfriend Candy (Charlize Theron) to St. Cloud for an abortion, and Homer decides to go with them when they leave, hoping to see the world; however, the three end up going no further than the state line, where Wally's mother (Kate Nelligan) runs an apple orchard and cider mill, and Candy's family traps lobsters. When Wally ships off to battle, Homer grows closer to Candy, and the two fall in love. But their idyllic life at the cider mill is interrupted when Rose Rose (Erykah Badu), a field worker at the orchard, becomes pregnant and her father, cider-house foreman Mr. Rose (Delroy Lindo), turns out to be the father of her unborn child. This news coupled with the death of Dr. Larch, forces Homer to take a long look at both his moral principles and his future. Rapper Heavy D appears in the supporting cast as Peaches(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Catch Me if You Can</title>
    <desc lang="en">A gifted forger and confidence man attempts to stay one step ahead of the lawman determined to bring him to justice in this comedy-drama from Steven Spielberg, based on a true story. Frank W. Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a 16-year-old high school student who finds himself emotionally cut adrift when his mother, Paula (Nathalie Baye), leaves his father, Frank Abagnale Sr. (Christopher Walken), after Frank Sr. falls into arrears with the Internal Revenue Service. One day at school, Frank Jr. attempts to pass himself off as a substitute teacher, and easily makes the subterfuge work. His small-scale success gives Frank some ideas, and he soon discovers bigger and more profitable ways of hoaxing others, passing himself off as an airline pilot, a doctor, and an attorney. Along the way, Frank learns how to become a master forger, and uses his talent and charm to pass over 2.5 million dollars in phony checks. Frank's increasingly audacious work soon attracts the attention of Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), an FBI agent who is determined to put Frank behind bars. Frank seems to enjoy being pursued by Carl, and even goes so far as to call Carl on the phone to chat every once in a while. While posing as a doctor, Frank falls in love with Brenda Strong (Amy Adams), a sweet girl working as a candy striper. When Frank asks Brenda to marry him, he decides to assume a new identity to impress her father, Roger (Martin Sheen) -- who happens to be the District Attorney of New Orleans, LA. Catch Me If You Can was based on the autobiography of the real Frank W. Abagnale Jr., who has a cameo in the film and today works on the side of the law as a top consultant on preventing forgery and designing secure checking systems(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Cider House Rules</title>
    <desc lang="en">John Irving scripted this screen adaptation of his 1985 novel. Set during World War II, The Cider House Rules concerns Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire), an orphan who spent most of his childhood at the St. Cloud Orphanage in rural Maine, where he grew up under the strong but affectionate care of Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine). Larch has passed along his medical education to Homer, and the young man helps the doctor care for abandoned children and the newborn babies of unwed mothers; however, Homer refuses to assist Larch with the illegal abortions that he performs on the side; Homer has moral objections to abortion, while Larch believes in the rights of the individual and sees it as his duty to keep women in need away from dangerous incompetents. Wally Worthington (Paul Rudd), an air-force pilot, brings his girlfriend Candy (Charlize Theron) to St. Cloud for an abortion, and Homer decides to go with them when they leave, hoping to see the world; however, the three end up going no further than the state line, where Wally's mother (Kate Nelligan) runs an apple orchard and cider mill, and Candy's family traps lobsters. When Wally ships off to battle, Homer grows closer to Candy, and the two fall in love. But their idyllic life at the cider mill is interrupted when Rose Rose (Erykah Badu), a field worker at the orchard, becomes pregnant and her father, cider-house foreman Mr. Rose (Delroy Lindo), turns out to be the father of her unborn child. This news coupled with the death of Dr. Larch, forces Homer to take a long look at both his moral principles and his future. Rapper Heavy D appears in the supporting cast as Peaches(n)</desc>

This is one of several seventh-season Murder She Wrote episodes introduced by Jessica Fletcher (Angela Lansbury) but starring Dennis Stanton (Keith Michell), a jewel thief turned insurance investigator. Stanton's latest assignment is to investigate the suspicious events surrounding a fire that destroyed the hands of famous concert pianist Vaclav Maryska (Ricardo Montalban). The intrigue reaches a crescendo when Maryska's wife Milena (Patricia Neal) is murdered, with a veritable orchestra of suspects at Stanton's disposal. As usual, Stanton is more or less assisted by ditzy Rhoda Markowitz (Hallie Todd) and by flustered Lt. Catalano (Ken Swofford)(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Kick-Ass</title>
    <desc lang="en">Matthew Vaughn's violent-but-hilarious action movie is a knowing take on the superhero genre, based on Mark Millar and John Romita Jr's comic-book series. Avid comic fan and New York high schooler Dave Lizewski has begun to wonder why his contemporaries are keener on vapid celebrity than wanting to emulate his (super) heroes and try to make the world a better place. Thus Lizewski orders a simply hideous skiing outfit and dons it to become Kick-Ass, scourge of New York's criminals. Well that's the idea, but of course it's his ass that gets kicked when he first tries to put his plan into action. Despite that setback, and spurred on by his desire for a female classmate, he has another go at launching his crime-fighting career. It almost ends as badly as the first one, but this time he's rescued by fellow 'superheroes' Hit Girl and Big Daddy. She's just 11 years old, but has a taste and aptitude for violence that would impress a ninja and swears frequently and badly enough to shock a football fan; he's ever the doting father, gifting her presents of lethal weapons. Together the trio embark on their quest to clean up the city. But waiting in the wings is crime boss Frank D'Amico - and he's no pushover. The film's controversial mix of humour, bad language, sophisticated satire and frequent violence garnered a raft of awards as well as widespread critical acclaim(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Doom</title>
    <desc lang="en">One of the most popular and influential video games ever makes its way to the big screen in this sci-fi thriller. A coalition of Earth's scientific and military interests have established a research colony called Olduvai on the planet Mars, but one day all communication from the outpost stops and no one can tell what has happened -- though the final messages suggest it's not good. Believing foul play may have overtaken Olduvai's crew, the Rapid Response Tactical Squad, a team of specially trained military personnel, are deployed to investigate the situation and, if necessary, eliminate the invaders. But Sarge (Dwayne Johnson, aka The Rock) and Reaper (Karl Urban), leaders of the RRTS team, soon discover the situation is far more grim than they could have imagined. An experiment on Olduvai has very literally opened a portal to Hades, and a variety of savage and demonic creatures have overtaken the colony. Now the RRTS must seal off Olduvai, close off any access to Earth, and exterminate the satanic beasts before they can kill again. Doom also stars Rosamund Pike (as Dr. Grimm), Dexter Fletcher, Ben Daniels, and Deobia Oparei(n)</desc>

The archaeologists battle inclement weather to begin a dig on the mainland, where team leader Francis Pryor sees characteristics suggestive of a classic Iron Age fort beginning to emerge.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Final Cut</title>
    <desc lang="en">First-time filmmaker Omar Naim wrote and directed the sci-fi drama The Final Cut. Set in the near future, the story concerns a device implanted in the body that is capable of recording a person's entire life. Once it is extracted from the body after death, the footage can be played back on a screen in the form of "rememories." Robin Williams plays Alan Hakman, an editor who cuts together the footage to make pleasant movies for funerals. Tormented by his job and his own memories, Alan also has a troubled romantic relationship with bookseller Delila (Mira Sorvino). While looking through footage for his next project, Alan discovers a man whom he believes is from his own past. Meanwhile, former editor Fletcher (James Caviezel) wants the footage for his own purposes. The Final Cut was shown at the Berlin Film Festival in 2004(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Better Luck Tomorrow director Justin Lin picks up where John Singleton left off to offer a high-octane look at the world of underground Japanese drift-racing in the latest installment of the super-charged Fast and the Furious film series. A frustrated teen from a broken home, Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) is an outsider looking to make a name for himself on the illegal street racing circuit. When Sean is busted by the police for his high-speed exploits and given the option of either spending time behind bars or moving overseas to live with his no-nonsense, military man father who's currently stationed in Tokyo, the young rebel packs his bags and sets his sights on Nippon. Though at first reluctant to adapt to the unfamiliar customs and foreign code of honor of his new home, Sean soon strikes up a friendship with American speed freak Twinkie (Bow Wow), a like-minded race fan who schools the inexperienced newcomer in the pulse-pounding world of drift-racing. Inadvertently challenging local champion and yakuza associate D.K. (The Drift King) his first time on the road, Sean is subsequently forced to work under expatriate Han (Sung Kang) to pay off his debt after failing to cross the finish line first. Taking note of the young American's affinity for racing as he warmly welcomes him into his merry band of misfit drift-fanatics, Han slowly introduces Sean to the key principles of the popular new racing style. When Sean makes the potentially deadly mistake of falling for D.K.'s girlfriend Neela (Nathalie Kelley), he'll need all the help he can get to face his most challenging race to date and take on the most notorious driver on the Tokyo drift scene in a hair-raising, hairpin-turn race where the winner truly takes all(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Windtalkers</title>
    <desc lang="en">Loosely based on a real-life operation during World War II, this action-adventure from director John Woo stars Nicolas Cage as Joe Enders, a Marine traumatized by the loss of his entire platoon in the Solomon Islands during an ambush he believes was deadlier than necessary due to his indecision. Suffering from eardrum damage in Hawaii, Joe manages to be declared fit for duty once again thanks to a sympathetic nurse (Frances O'Connor), but his new assignment isn't what he expects. Joe is ordered to safeguard a Navajo soldier named Ben Yahzee (Adam Beach) because the military has developed a new secret code based on the near-dead Navajo language that is proving unbreakable to the Japanese. Any soldier that speaks Navajo is an immediate asset, including Ben and his pal, Charlie Whitehorse (Roger Willie). Joe's orders are to "baby sit" Ben during the invasion of Saipan, protecting him if possible, but -- if the code-talker's capture becomes imminent -- to kill him before he falls into enemy hands. Meanwhile, Charlie is to be guarded by affable harmonica player Ox Henderson (Christian Slater). Joe reluctantly accepts this new duty as a way to get back into the war, and in the ensuing carnage, his nearly suicidal acts of bravery make him a hero while Ben becomes paralyzed by fear. Determined to live up to Joe's example, Ben musters up his courage, even in the face of racism from a fellow soldier (Noah Emmerich), and ends up rescuing his own protector behind enemy lines by briefly posing as a Japanese soldier. Despite their growing mutual respect, Joe is eventually forced to take an action that threatens to shatter his bond with Ben, as the war's tragic losses strike closer to home for both men. Windtalkers co-stars Peter Stormare, Jason Isaacs, and Mark Ruffalo(n)</desc>

Deakins, a traitor, crashes their Stealth bomber, steals the nuclear warheads and sets off to meet his terrorist masters. Hale pursues him, helped by glamorous park ranger Terry Carmichael and, of course, is assumed by the authorities to be in on the plot. Cue car chases, fights on moving (and burning) trains, gunfights galore and the constant threat of the weapons exploding en route.

Deakins, a traitor, crashes their Stealth bomber, steals the nuclear warheads and sets off to meet his terrorist masters. Hale pursues him, helped by glamorous park ranger Terry Carmichael and, of course, is assumed by the authorities to be in on the plot. Cue car chases, fights on moving (and burning) trains, gunfights galore and the constant threat of the weapons exploding en route.

    <desc lang="en">A widowed Englishman working in Denmark and a Danish hairdresser who's been left by her husband forge a fragile romance during a trip to Italy to see their son and daughter get married. Philip (Pierce Brosnan) is a stern businessman who hates living in Denmark, and hasn't seen his son Patrick (Sebastian Jessen) in years. He's in a race to Patrick's wedding in Italy when he has a chance run-in with Ida (Trine Dyrholm) who's recovering from successful chemotherapy treatments when she learns that her husband Leif (Kim Bodnia) has been sleeping with a younger woman. Ida also happens to be the mother of Astrid (Molly Blixt Egelind), Patrick's beautiful bride-to-be. Though initially Philip and Ida appear to have nothing in common, their shared recognition that their children's union may be in trouble before the wedding bells have started to chime leads to an unexpected connection, and a second chance at happiness as they work to set things right.

    <title lang="en">Deep Impact</title>
    <desc lang="en">Mimi Leder (The Peacemaker) directed this science-fiction disaster drama about the possible extinction of human life after a comet is discovered headed toward Earth with the collision only one year away. Ambitious MSNBC reporter Jenny Lerner (Tea Leoni) stumbles onto the story, prompting a White House press conference. United States President Beck (Morgan Freeman) announces the government's solution: a team of astronauts will travel to the comet and destroy it. The team leader aboard the spaceship Messiah is Spurgeon Tanner (Robert Duvall), who was once the last man to walk on the moon. However, the mission fails, splitting off a chunk of the comet, now due to land in the Atlantic with the impact sending a 350-foot tidal wave flooding 650 miles inland, destroying New York and other cities. The larger part of the comet, hitting in Canada, will trigger an E.L.E. (Extinction Level Event), not unlike a "nuclear winter" as dust clouds block out the sun and bring life to an end. President Beck reveals Plan B: a cavernous underground retreat constructed to hold one million Americans, with most to be selected through a national lottery. Since teenage amateur astronomer Leo Biederman (Elijah Wood) discovered the comet, his family gets a pass to enter the cave, but his girlfriend Sarah (Leelee Sobieski) and her parents will be left behind. Meanwhile, still in space, Spurgeon Tanner devises a plan for a kamikaze-styled operation that could possibly save the Earth.

Freshly minted from Harvard, Sam (Christian Bale) and Alex (Kate Beckinsale) are eager to continue their medical studies out West, but they need some lodging while they hunt for a home. Enter Jane (Frances McDormand), Sam's estranged, Age-of-Aquarius mom, who's more than willing to put the couple up in her lavish digs. Jane is a successful record producer whose latest charge -- both in the studio and in her bedroom -- is Ian (Alessandro Nivola), a brazen, libidinous twentysomething Brit-rocker. As Sam and Alex settle in at Jane's, they gradually lose their straight-and-narrow approach to life and begin to experiment. Alex takes to Ian and Jane, while Sam is wooed by co-worker Sara (Natascha McElhone). Laurel Canyon features a score by Shudder to Think's Craig Wedren; the music for Ian's band was provided by Sparklehorse's Mark Linkous and indie-rockers Folk Implosion(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Deep Impact</title>
    <desc lang="en">Mimi Leder (The Peacemaker) directed this science-fiction disaster drama about the possible extinction of human life after a comet is discovered headed toward Earth with the collision only one year away. Ambitious MSNBC reporter Jenny Lerner (Tea Leoni) stumbles onto the story, prompting a White House press conference. United States President Beck (Morgan Freeman) announces the government's solution: a team of astronauts will travel to the comet and destroy it. The team leader aboard the spaceship Messiah is Spurgeon Tanner (Robert Duvall), who was once the last man to walk on the moon. However, the mission fails, splitting off a chunk of the comet, now due to land in the Atlantic with the impact sending a 350-foot tidal wave flooding 650 miles inland, destroying New York and other cities. The larger part of the comet, hitting in Canada, will trigger an E.L.E. (Extinction Level Event), not unlike a "nuclear winter" as dust clouds block out the sun and bring life to an end. President Beck reveals Plan B: a cavernous underground retreat constructed to hold one million Americans, with most to be selected through a national lottery. Since teenage amateur astronomer Leo Biederman (Elijah Wood) discovered the comet, his family gets a pass to enter the cave, but his girlfriend Sarah (Leelee Sobieski) and her parents will be left behind. Meanwhile, still in space, Spurgeon Tanner devises a plan for a kamikaze-styled operation that could possibly save the Earth.

Things go badly for Axle on his first day working at a big-box discount store, and he's left with little alternative than to ask Claire to let him stay with her; she and her roommate, Fibbi (Heather Graham), aren't so sure this is a good idea, but they grudgingly agree and end up helping Axle in his bid to redeem himself.

    <desc lang="en">Andy Tennant's romantic comedy fantasy is set in 16th-century France, where, following the death of her father, Danielle De Barbarac is assigned kitchen duties in the castle by her stepmother Baroness Rodmilla de Ghent. A chance meeting with Prince Henry, heir apparent to the throne, leads to the potential for a romance that she fears could be ruined if he discovers the masquerade. A "fairy godmother" in the shape of Leonardo da Vinci eventually smoothes the path of true love but, thanks to Barrymore, this is not another soft retelling of Cinderella but a punchy, energetic film with Barrymore in excellent form as the forthright Danielle(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Texas Rangers</title>
    <desc lang="en">The true story of the formation of the Texas Rangers provides the backdrop for this youth-oriented Western. In 1875, after the Civil War, Leander McNelly (Dylan McDermott) organizes the Texas Rangers to battle the outlaws terrorizing Texas, notably crime kingpin John King Fisher (Alfred Molina). With a team of experienced gunmen (Robert Patrick and Randy Travis) and enthusiastic but green recruits (James Van Der Beek, Usher Raymond, and Ashton Kutcher), McNelly and his Rangers bring law and order to the wild Texas plains; McNelly must also keep order among his charges when two rangers fall in love with the same woman, Caroline Dukes (Rachael Leigh Cook). Tom Skerritt and Vincent Spano are also featured in the supporting cast; the screenplay, adapted from a script by John Milius, was at one time set to be filmed by Sam Peckinpah, shortly before the legendary Western director's death in 1984(n)</desc>

In this one, Mumy plays Billy Bayles, a 5-year-old boy with a strong attachment to his grandmother (Lili Darvas). Using a toy telephone he'd received for his birthday, Billy communicates with his beloved Grandma -- several days and weeks after her death. Philip Abbott and Patricia Smith costar as Billy's distraught parents, who are convinced (rightly, as it turns out), that Grandma wants to inveigle the boy into joining her in the Next World.

    <desc lang="en">A retired storm chaser teams-up with his sister and his former partner to prevent Boston from being leveled by an onslaught of apocalyptic twisters that throw off exploding, bowling ball-sized stones capable of destroying entire city blocks. Convinced that the tornados tearing through the shores of Boston are the first wave of a devastating storm front, extreme weather expert Joe Randall watches in horror as the winds shift inland. It's an unprecedented weather phenomenon that could destroy the entire Eastern Seaboard, and the only means of stopping it may be a radical theory that flies in the face of modern meteorology. Now, as Joe's children find themselves trapped in a nearby stadium as the storm gains momentum, the concerned father recruits the two people he trusts most to help validate his controversial theory, and save the city. Meanwhile, their efforts may actually be accelerating the storm front, instead of subduing it(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Friday the 13th</title>
    <desc lang="en">A man in search of his missing sister stumbles across a deadly secret in the woods surrounding Crystal Lake as Texas Chainsaw Massacre redux duo Michael Bay and Marcus Nispel resurrect one of the silver screen's most feared slashers -- machete-wielding, hockey mask-wearing madman Jason Voorhees. The last time Clay heard from his sister, she was headed toward Crystal Lake. There, amidst the creaky old cabins and moss-coated trees, an unstoppable force of evil lies quietly dormant, patiently waiting for the perfect moment to strike. Though the police and locals all warn Clay to stay as far away from Crystal Lake as possible, it's the only lead he has, and he isn't willing to give up until he finds his sister. Clay isn't the only one inhabiting these woods either, because a group of thrill-seeking college students have just arrived at Crystal Lake hoping for a wild weekend of fun in the sun. Later, as Clay and one of the recently arrived revelers search for clues, the infamous Jason Voorhees emerges to show them just why the locals have avoided these woods for years. Could it be that Clay's sister has already met a grim demise at the end of Jason's razor-sharp machete, or is she still out there somewhere in the woods, waiting for her brother to come to her rescue? Freddy vs. Jason scribes Damian Shannon and Mark Swift pen the screenplay for a remake executive produced by Sean S. Cunningham (producer/director of the original Friday the 13th)(n)</desc>
