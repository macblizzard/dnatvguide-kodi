Ultimately, the mother and daughter are able to relocate to an apartment, which, despite its excessively dilapidated interior, seems to be an adequate location for beginning a new life. Before long, however, what appears to be the spirit of a young girl begins to haunt them. No stranger to mental illness, the wary young woman brushes the visions aside as part of the inherent stress of making the transition from housewife to working, single mom. As time goes by and the apparent haunting does not subside, the apartment's new residents are forced to examine the history of its former tenants. Dark Water also features performances from John C. Reilly, Tim Roth, and Dougray Scott(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This weekly, syndicated children's reality show was packaged by Steve Rotfeld Productions, the same firm responsible for such similar FCC-friendly efforts as Awesome Adventures and Wild About Animals. Hosted by Christine Long, the series used actual footage and re-enactments to show its target audience (kids aged 13 to 16) how to confront and cope with extraordinary situations, many of them dangerous in nature. Typical episodes demonstrated CPR techniques, the extinguishing of household fires, and the handling of moral dilemmas. Also offered were tips on building, cooking and general housekeeping, with added input from experts in these fields. Offering three to four "features" per half hour episode, WHADDAYDO? was first distributed by TVI Media beginning the week of September 12, 2005(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">I Am Legend</title>
    <desc lang="en">Adapted from acclaimed author Richard Matheson's influential novelette of the same name, Constantine director Francis Lawrence's I Am Legend follows the last man on Earth as he struggles to survive while fending off the infected survivors of a devastating vampiric plague. A brilliant scientist who raced to discover a cure for the man-made virus as humanity came crumbling down all around him, Robert Neville (Will Smith) was inexplicably immune to the highly contagious superbug. Now the entire population of New York City -- and perhaps the world -- has been transformed into carnivorous bloodsuckers that fear the light and live solely to spread their contagion to any remaining living creature that crosses their path. It's been three years since civilization came to an end, and the loneliness has taken a devastating toll on Neville. By day he scours the city for food and supplies while sending out desperate radio messages in hopes that someone might respond, and by night he attempts to find a way to reverse the effects of the virus by experimenting with his own blood. But time is running out for Neville as the legions of infected watch his every move from the safety of the shadows, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. They, too, long to learn the secret that lurks in Neville's blood, though they will have to take caution while attempting to procure it because Neville will sooner die attempting to slay every last one of them than willingly giving up a single drop. Previously adapted for the screen in the 1964 Vincent Price frightener The Last Man on Earth and the 1971 Charlton Heston action film The Omega Man, Matheson's novelette also served as the inspiration for George A. Romero's groundbreaking zombie classic Night of the Living Dead(n)</desc>

Bender asks what it would be like if he were 500 feet tall, so he becomes a giant and flies to Earth to the tune of Black Sabbath's "Iron Man." He befriends a boy (Fry) and accidentally destroys the city in a take on The Iron Giant. The Professor then makes Dr. Zoidberg a giant so they can fight each other. Leela asks what it would be like if she were more impulsive, so she ends up killing the Professor in order to get his fortune. As people find out about the murder, she is forced to kill them one by one until she has killed almost everyone. Fry asks what it would be like if he were never cryogenically frozen in 1999. He ends up meeting the Action Rangers -- made up of scientist Stephen Hawking, Vice President Al Gore, Star Trek actress Nichelle Nichols, and Dungeons and Dragons creator Gary Gygax(n)</desc>

A town drenched in darkness and inhabited by a strange collection of menacing specters, Silent Hill seemingly swallows young Sharon whole upon arrival. Determined to get her daughter back at any cost, Rose sets out to explore the mysterious Silent Hill, only to discover an evil so powerful that it possesses the ability to transform anything it wishes. With the deeply disturbing history of the town slowly coming into focus through the dense fog, Rose soon realizes that both she and her daughter may be little more than simple pawns in a much larger, and seemingly supernatural, game(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">John Ford Goes to War</title>
    <desc lang="en">In this documentary centered on legendary filmmaker John Ford's cinematic contributions to Allied morale during World War II, actor/musician Kris Kristofferson narrates as the How Green Was My Valley director turns his back on Tinseltown in order to fulfill his patriotic duty. By the time the United States became involved in World War II, John Ford was already a film legend, but when Uncle Sam came calling the veteran filmmaker eagerly packed his bags and set his sites on the frontlines. Though Ford did sustain battlefield injuries during the production of the Oscar-winning documentary The Battle of Midway, the remarkable film endeared him to patriotic American audiences across the country and his next wartime effort, 1943's December 7th, proceeded to earn the filmmaker yet another Oscar. In addition to featuring footage from these and other, lesser-known wartime films from Ford, this documentary also offers an intimate look at the complex filmmaker and explores his remarkable legacy through both archive footage and interviews with such notable directors as Oliver Stone and Peter Bogdanovich(n)</desc>

Six years after NASA beamed a powerful signal to an Earth-like planet outside our solar system, we get a response. Only the extraterrestrials don't send a message: they come calling, landing five huge amphibious spacecraft in the Pacific, just as a US/Japanese naval exercise has begun. The visitors initially just seem wary, but a panicked reaction from our warships makes them reassess us as hostile and sparks a ferocious response. And so it falls to hot-headed US Navy officer Lieutenant Alex Hopper, his older brother Commander Stone Hopper and the commander of the fleet Admiral Shane to defeat a threat which is greater than they first think. Also starring singer Rihanna as a US Navy gunner, though perhaps the film's real star is its CGI special effects. Edited for language and violence(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">After four weeks of heats, 40 hopefuls have been whittled down to the most promising 12 - and now they face the knockout stage, beginning with either a main or a pudding based on briefs by judges John Torode and Gregg Wallace. The top nine then go straight to the next stage, while the bottom three face a cook-off in which they have to come up with their showstopper dish - and with only two more places available, only the best will do.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The knockout stage continues, and if the amateurs thought it was tough getting this far, the upcoming round will really sort the dishwashers from the chefs. Over the next two nights the remaining contestants are split into two groups and get their first taste of professional cooking. Tonight's hopefuls head to London restaurant Typing Room, overseen by Lee Westcott, where they serve up every dish during a busy lunchtime service. Then it's back to the studio for an Invention Test - but adding to the pressure, they'll be presenting their food to MasterChef: The Professionals judge and formidable perfectionist Monica Galetti. After this, one of them will be hanging up their apron and going home.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Former Saturday Night Live "Weekend Update" co-anchors Tina Fey and Amy Poehler co-star in this baby-fever comedy about a single, career-oriented woman who previously put parenthood on hold, and is forced to hire a surrogate mother when she discovers there is only a one-in-a-million chance that she will be able to get pregnant. Kate Holbrook (Fey) is a 37-year-old business executive who has always put her professional life before her personal life, but these days her biological clock is ticking louder than ever before. As with everything else she has accomplished in life, Kate is determined to have a child on her own terms. Unfortunately for Kate, the chance of her ever becoming pregnant is slim to none. Undaunted, a willful Kate drafts South Philly working-class girl Angie Ostrowiski (Poehler) -- a woman who may just be her polar opposite -- to be a surrogate mother. Subsequently informed by the head of the surrogacy center (Sigourney Weaver) that her surrogate is indeed pregnant, the excited mother-to-be soon purchases every child-rearing book she can find and excitedly begins the nesting process. But life hasn't quit throwing Kate curveballs just yet, because when a pregnant Angie shows up on her doorstep with no place to live, the woman who once thrived on order finds her life descending into chaos. Now, as Kate attempts to transform Angie into the ideal expectant mother, this odd couple will discover that families aren't always biological, but occasionally formed through friendship as well. Writer Michael McCullers, who authored the screenplays for Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and Undercover Brother in addition to working on Saturday Night Live, makes his feature directorial debut with a self-penned screenplay(n)</desc>

Ham III, the grandson of the first ever chimp in space, is a wise-cracking smart aleck who makes a living being fired from a cannon. When the Infinity Space Probe goes missing, Ham joins a mission to find it. He's been recruited as a PR stunt, but his fellow Space Chimps, Luna and Titan, are highly trained experts. When they crash-land on the planet Malgor, they find a race of aliens who are being oppressed by the tyrannical Zartog, who is using the probe for his own nefarious ends. Can the feckless Ham use his circus skills to save the day, help liberate the aliens, recover the probe, get the girl, and find a way to get back home? This is great fare for all the family, with plenty of deadpan asides to keep grown-ups entertained(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Former Saturday Night Live "Weekend Update" co-anchors Tina Fey and Amy Poehler co-star in this baby-fever comedy about a single, career-oriented woman who previously put parenthood on hold, and is forced to hire a surrogate mother when she discovers there is only a one-in-a-million chance that she will be able to get pregnant. Kate Holbrook (Fey) is a 37-year-old business executive who has always put her professional life before her personal life, but these days her biological clock is ticking louder than ever before. As with everything else she has accomplished in life, Kate is determined to have a child on her own terms. Unfortunately for Kate, the chance of her ever becoming pregnant is slim to none. Undaunted, a willful Kate drafts South Philly working-class girl Angie Ostrowiski (Poehler) -- a woman who may just be her polar opposite -- to be a surrogate mother. Subsequently informed by the head of the surrogacy center (Sigourney Weaver) that her surrogate is indeed pregnant, the excited mother-to-be soon purchases every child-rearing book she can find and excitedly begins the nesting process. But life hasn't quit throwing Kate curveballs just yet, because when a pregnant Angie shows up on her doorstep with no place to live, the woman who once thrived on order finds her life descending into chaos. Now, as Kate attempts to transform Angie into the ideal expectant mother, this odd couple will discover that families aren't always biological, but occasionally formed through friendship as well. Writer Michael McCullers, who authored the screenplays for Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and Undercover Brother in addition to working on Saturday Night Live, makes his feature directorial debut with a self-penned screenplay(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Space Chimps</title>
    <desc lang="en">In Kirk DeMicco's animated film three supersonic simian spacemen take to the cosmos to find a missing probe, and encounter a whole world of trouble along the way. Ham III, the grandson of the first ever chimp in space, is a wise-cracking smart aleck who makes a living being fired from a cannon. When the Infinity Space Probe goes missing, Ham joins a mission to find it. He's been recruited as a PR stunt, but his fellow Space Chimps, Luna and Titan, are highly trained experts. When they crash-land on the planet Malgor, they find a race of aliens who are being oppressed by the tyrannical Zartog, who is using the probe for his own nefarious ends. Can the feckless Ham use his circus skills to save the day, help liberate the aliens, recover the probe, get the girl, and find a way to get back home? This is great fare for all the family, with plenty of deadpan asides to keep grown-ups entertained(n)</desc>

The filmmakers centerpiece is an attempt by the threesome's legal team to earn them a new hearing by getting the Arkansas State supreme court to define what kind of new evidence can be admitted into evidence when an old murder case is reopened because of new DNA testing.

Jamal reveals that the right answer to each question has come from a significant part of his life, from when he and his brother Salim were orphaned after their mother was killed in religious violence. As he continues his story, Jamal reveals how he knows each answer; how he fell in love with Latika, an orphaned girl from whom he was later separated; and how his brother Salim took the path of violence as a gangster's gunman. But as Jamal is returned to the studio for the last question, Salim finally repays his brother's trust. As well as the outstanding Patel, Jamal is played in different stages of his life by Tanay Hemant Gharu and Ayush Mahesh Khedekar; Salim is played by Madhur Mittal, Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala and Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail; Latika is played by Frieda Pinto, Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar and Rubina Ali, all of whom turn in stunning performances.

The filmmakers centerpiece is an attempt by the threesome's legal team to earn them a new hearing by getting the Arkansas State supreme court to define what kind of new evidence can be admitted into evidence when an old murder case is reopened because of new DNA testing.

    <desc lang="en">Former Saturday Night Live "Weekend Update" co-anchors Tina Fey and Amy Poehler co-star in this baby-fever comedy about a single, career-oriented woman who previously put parenthood on hold, and is forced to hire a surrogate mother when she discovers there is only a one-in-a-million chance that she will be able to get pregnant. Kate Holbrook (Fey) is a 37-year-old business executive who has always put her professional life before her personal life, but these days her biological clock is ticking louder than ever before. As with everything else she has accomplished in life, Kate is determined to have a child on her own terms. Unfortunately for Kate, the chance of her ever becoming pregnant is slim to none. Undaunted, a willful Kate drafts South Philly working-class girl Angie Ostrowiski (Poehler) -- a woman who may just be her polar opposite -- to be a surrogate mother. Subsequently informed by the head of the surrogacy center (Sigourney Weaver) that her surrogate is indeed pregnant, the excited mother-to-be soon purchases every child-rearing book she can find and excitedly begins the nesting process. But life hasn't quit throwing Kate curveballs just yet, because when a pregnant Angie shows up on her doorstep with no place to live, the woman who once thrived on order finds her life descending into chaos. Now, as Kate attempts to transform Angie into the ideal expectant mother, this odd couple will discover that families aren't always biological, but occasionally formed through friendship as well. Writer Michael McCullers, who authored the screenplays for Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and Undercover Brother in addition to working on Saturday Night Live, makes his feature directorial debut with a self-penned screenplay(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">A Serious Man</title>
    <desc lang="en">Filmmaking duo Joel and Ethan Coen write, produce, and direct this period black comedy set in 1967 concerning a Midwestern physics professor whose staid and stable life slowly begins to unravel after his wife announces that she's leaving him. As if the failure of his longtime marriage wasn't enough for Larry Gopnik (Tony-nominated Michael Stuhlbarg) to contend with, now his socially inept brother refuses to move out of the house as well. Larry is a modest man of science. Up to this point, his life has been uneventful at best, but things are about to get interesting. When his wife, Judith, announces that she is leaving him to move in with his smug colleague Sy Ableman, Larry does his best to contend with his failed marriage while barely tolerating his unemployable brother, Arthur, who appears to have grown roots on Larry's couch. Meanwhile, Larry's son, Danny, is getting into trouble at Hebrew school, and his daughter, Sarah, is stealthily snatching money from his wallet so she can afford a nose job. As Judith and Sy merrily begin making plans for their new life of domestic bliss together, Larry begins receiving a series of anonymous letters from someone who seems intent on sabotaging his chance for tenure at the university. To further complicate matters, a graduate student with failing grades is attempting to bribe the professor while simultaneously threatening him with a defamation lawsuit. Larry is in some serious need of equilibrium, though it's hard to focus on getting your life in order when your beautiful neighbor insists on sunbathing in the nude just outside your window. Perhaps by seeking the advice of three trusted rabbis, Larry can finally learn to cope with his afflictions and become a genuine mensch. A Serious Man is the second in a two-picture deal that the siblings made with Focus Features and Working Title. The first film in the deal, entitled Burn After Reading and starring Brad Pitt, George Clooney, and Frances McDormand, was released nationwide in September 2008(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Snow Angels</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director/screenwriter David Gordon Green adapts Stewart O'Nan's popular novel to the screen in this feature, which tells the parallel tales of a teenager named Arthur (Michael Angarano) and his onetime babysitter Annie (Kate Beckinsale) -- whose turbulent relationship with her estranged husband, Glenn (Sam Rockwell), leads the small-town waitress down a troubled path. Arthur is a high-school student from a dysfunctional family, and does everything in his power to avoid hanging around the house while mom and dad quarrel. When he's not practicing his trombone and performing with the high-school marching band, Arthur can usually be found bussing tables at the local Chinese restaurant and flirting with older waitress Annie. Annie used to be Arthur's babysitter, and is currently struggling to separate from her former high-school sweetheart, Glenn. But being a single mother isn't easy, especially since the troubled Glenn wants nothing more than to clean up his act and reunite his family. Back at school, Arthur and pretty classmate Lila (Olivia Thirlby) have been bonding over their mutual love for all things geeky. Though the casual friendship shows promise of evolving into something more when Lila expresses her true feelings for Arthur, he can't help but becoming distracted by his chaotic family life: his father is moving out of the family home, and his mother is doing everything in her power to maintain some semblance of normalcy. Realizing that happiness is fleeting as his family becomes shattered and Annie experiences a series of distressing encounters with Glenn, Arthur gradually begins to fall for Lisa despite his growing cynicism concerning long-term relationships. Later, on a cold winter morning, Glenn and Annie's past catches up with them in a blinding flash, and the lives of everyone they know are suddenly and irrevocably changed(n)</desc>

So far this year, the panel has been entertained by the likes of acrobatic dancers, a junior magician inspired by Harry Potter, and a comedy dance duo who roped Ant and Dec into their routine. Simon Cowell and Alesha Dixon have already hit their Golden Buzzers to send singer Sarah Ikumu and young all-girl dance troupe Just Us through to the live shows, and Amanda Holden threw her support behind comedian Daliso Chaponda. David Walliams and Ant and Dec are yet to cast their votes, but have offered a few teasers about what to expect from their chosen performers.(n)</desc>

George knew nothing about the company's crimes; he's just the convenient fall guy. It turns out that the operation was also laundering money for the mob, so he agrees to help prosecutors build a case against the other executives and testify in court in exchange for going into hiding. George packs up his much younger second wife (Denise Richards), his bitter teenage daughter (Danielle Campbell), his neglected younger son (Devan Leos), and his dementia-addled mother (Doris Roberts), and together they travel to the safe house that Brian (Tyler Perry), the case's lead prosecutor, has chosen for them. However, that safe house is really the home of Brian's tell-it-like-it-is aunt Madea (also played by Perry), who helps the family get over their personal and legal issues(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Ubiquitous MTV emcee/vee-jay/interviewer Carson Daly came to "mainstream" TV as host of this nightly NBC half-hour chatfest, which aired just after Late Night With Conan O'Brien in the 12:35 a.m. time slot previously occupied by Later With Bob Costas. Taped on the network's Saturday Night Live set in New York, the series did its best to eschew the usual couch-and-desk talk show format; with no monologue and no sketches, Daly simply sat down and talked to his guests, who returned the compliment by avoiding the standard relentless plugging of their latest movie, CD, or TV special. Last Call With Carson Daly was supposed to premiere on Monday, January 7, 2002, but a last-minute contract dispute between MTV and NBC forced the latter network to sheepishly issue an apology and move the debut episode to Tuesday, January 8(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Ubiquitous MTV emcee/vee-jay/interviewer Carson Daly came to "mainstream" TV as host of this nightly NBC half-hour chatfest, which aired just after Late Night With Conan O'Brien in the 12:35 a.m. time slot previously occupied by Later With Bob Costas. Taped on the network's Saturday Night Live set in New York, the series did its best to eschew the usual couch-and-desk talk show format; with no monologue and no sketches, Daly simply sat down and talked to his guests, who returned the compliment by avoiding the standard relentless plugging of their latest movie, CD, or TV special. Last Call With Carson Daly was supposed to premiere on Monday, January 7, 2002, but a last-minute contract dispute between MTV and NBC forced the latter network to sheepishly issue an apology and move the debut episode to Tuesday, January 8(n)</desc>

Meanwhile, James May spends time at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan to learn about the army's vehicle redeployment efforts, and Thor star Tom Hiddleston tries to coax the best time he can muster from the Reasonably Priced Car.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A young couple (Alexie Gilmore, Bryce Johnson) venture into Six Rivers National Forest in Northern California to search for Bigfoot, and make a terrifying discovery in this found-footage horror film from writer-director Bobcat Goldthwait. Convinced that he will capture video evidence of Sasquatch at the same place where the legendary Patterson-Gimlin film was shot, Jim (Bryce Johnson) persuades his skeptical girlfriend Kelly (Alexie Gilmore) to join him on a cryptozoological excursion into the deep woods. Before Jim and Kelly set out on their mission, however, they first visit Willow Creek -- a town that thrives on the Bigfoot phenomenon -- to interview the locals about the legend. There, the couple are repeatedly warned that the forest can be a dangerous place at night -- warnings that go unheeded by Jim as he single-mindedly focuses on making the journey he's dreamt about for years. Later, in the darkened woods, however, the once-carefree couple experience paralyzing fear when someone -- or something -- begins rooting around their campsite, and uttering inhuman howls. Uncertain if they've actually survived an encounter with Bigfoot or simply fallen victim to a cruel prank by the locals, Jim and Kelly agree to pack their bags, and return to civilization at sunrise.

    <title lang="en">Tyler Perry's Meet the Browns</title>
    <desc lang="en">Prolific playwright Tyler Perry adapts his popular stage play of the same name in this family-oriented comedy concerning a desperate mother who connects with the family she never knew. Brenda is a single Chicago mother of three who has been struggling for years to keep her kids off of the streets. Suddenly let go from her job with no warning to speak of, the eternally optimistic mother begins to experience a suffocating sense of hopelessness for the very first time in her life. When Brenda receives a death notice claiming that the father she has never met has passed away, she quickly gathers up the kids and sets out for Georgia to attend the funeral. Upon arriving in the Deep South, the once fretful mother is pleasantly surprised to discover that there is a whole side of the family she never knew existed. A crass but good-natured clan that welcomes Brenda and her children with open arms, the Browns' lazy summer afternoons and frequent trips to the county fair offer a much-needed contrast to the stress of surviving in inner city Chicago. Writer/director/actor Perry reprises his role as indomitable, law-breaking grandmother Madea in a comedy that proves sometimes second chances come when you least expect it(n)</desc>

There, the couple are repeatedly warned that the forest can be a dangerous place at night -- warnings that go unheeded by Jim as he single-mindedly focuses on making the journey he's dreamt about for years. Later, in the darkened woods, however, the once-carefree couple experience paralyzing fear when someone -- or something -- begins rooting around their campsite, and uttering inhuman howls. Uncertain if they've actually survived an encounter with Bigfoot or simply fallen victim to a cruel prank by the locals, Jim and Kelly agree to pack their bags, and return to civilization at sunrise.

    <title lang="en">The Pink Panther</title>
    <desc lang="en">The world's most inept detective returns to the screen in this modern slapstick comedy. France's come-from-behind victory in the World Cup soccer championships turns tragic when the team's coach, Yves Gulant (Jason Statham), is murdered during a post-game celebration. Gulant's girlfriend, pop star Xania (Beyoncé Knowles), was standing by his side as he was felled by a poisoned dart, and in the chaos that followed a diamond ring he gave her was stolen, which held one of the world's largest and most valuable jewels, known as "the Pink Panther." The media and the public demand that the killer be found out and brought to justice, and Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Kevin Kline) of the Paris Police pledges to put his best man on the case. However, somehow the astoundingly clumsy but consistently lucky Inspector Jacques Clouseau (Steve Martin) gets the assignment instead, and with his assistant, Gendarme Gilbert Ponton (Jean Reno), in tow, Clouseau follows a dizzying trail of clues from Paris to New York City as he attempts to recover the rare diamond and find the villains who killed Gulant. An updated variant on the Inspector Clouseau comedies that helped make Peter Sellers a major star in the United States, The Pink Panther also stars Emily Mortimer, Kristin Chenoweth, Roger Rees, and William Abadie; leading man Steve Martin also wrote the film's screenplay(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Big Night</title>
    <desc lang="en">Mouth-watering film about two Italian brothers trying to make a success of their authentic restaurant in 1950s New York. Primo (Tony Shalhoub) is the extremely gifted but difficult chef and his brother Secondo (Stanley Tucci) is the smooth front man who tries in vain to keep the restaurant afloat and to control his brother's temper. The restaurant is in dire trouble and the brothers are staring failure in the face when successful restaurant owner Pascal (Ian Holm) offers a solution. He owns a flashy Americanized Italian eatery which offers customers entertainment and mediocre food and suggests that he invite his 'friend', a big jazz musician, to play at the brothers' restaurant. Excited, the brothers set about preparing for the big night, inviting friends along for the event. Primo is planning a feast fit for a king with enough food to feed the whole of Italy! When the guests arrive, the food and drink begins to flow and the crowd enjoy a riotous night of dancing and singing as the brothers discover what really matters in life(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Pink Panther</title>
    <desc lang="en">The world's most inept detective returns to the screen in this modern slapstick comedy. France's come-from-behind victory in the World Cup soccer championships turns tragic when the team's coach, Yves Gulant (Jason Statham), is murdered during a post-game celebration. Gulant's girlfriend, pop star Xania (Beyoncé Knowles), was standing by his side as he was felled by a poisoned dart, and in the chaos that followed a diamond ring he gave her was stolen, which held one of the world's largest and most valuable jewels, known as "the Pink Panther." The media and the public demand that the killer be found out and brought to justice, and Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Kevin Kline) of the Paris Police pledges to put his best man on the case. However, somehow the astoundingly clumsy but consistently lucky Inspector Jacques Clouseau (Steve Martin) gets the assignment instead, and with his assistant, Gendarme Gilbert Ponton (Jean Reno), in tow, Clouseau follows a dizzying trail of clues from Paris to New York City as he attempts to recover the rare diamond and find the villains who killed Gulant. An updated variant on the Inspector Clouseau comedies that helped make Peter Sellers a major star in the United States, The Pink Panther also stars Emily Mortimer, Kristin Chenoweth, Roger Rees, and William Abadie; leading man Steve Martin also wrote the film's screenplay(n)</desc>

When Ali lands a job as a bouncer in a nearby nightclub, things quickly start to look up for the itinerant father and son. Then one night, after breaking up a fight in the club, Ali meets the radiant Stephanie (Marion Cotillard), and slips her his number after dropping her off safely at home. Though Stephanie's position on the high end of the social spectrum makes romance an unlikely prospect for the pair, a tragic accident at Marineland robs her of her legs, and finds her reaching out in desperation to Ali. Her spirit broken by the same tragedy that took her legs, Stephanie gradually finds the courage to go on living trough transcendent moments spent with Ali -- a man with precious little pity, but an enormous love of life(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Perfect Holiday</title>
    <desc lang="en">Gabrielle Union, Morris Chestnut, Queen Latifah, and Terrence Howard star in a film concerning a young girl who implores a department-store Santa to find a new husband for her divorced mother for Christmas. Single mother of three Nancy (Union) has been putting the needs of her three children ahead of her own for as far back as she can remember, and lately her youngest daughter, Emily (Khail Bryant), has become acutely aware of her mother's palpable sadness. As Christmas draws near, Nancy takes her kids to the mall for a cheerful visit with jolly old Saint Nick. When it comes time for Emily's turn to sit on Santa's lap and make her Christmas wish, she selflessly remembers her mother's recent comment that a compliment from a man would be the best gift of all. Determined to make her mother happy again even if it means sacrificing her own wish, Emily relays the message to Santa (Chestnut), not realizing that the man beneath the beard is actually an office-supply salesman and ambitious singer/songwriter named Benjamin. Recognizing the daughter's love for her mother and sensing something truly special in Nancy, Benjamin cheerfully obliges the young girl, setting into motion a series of events that promise to make this the most memorable holiday in quite some time.

Jean Hamilton (Heather Locklear) is a single mother with two daughters, teenaged Holly (Hilary Duff) and grade-school-aged Zoe (Aria Wallace). Fortysomething Jean has stumbled in and out of a number of bad relationships in her lifetime, and is desperate to find a good man; however, Holly has grown a bit tired of Jean's favored means of therapy after a bad breakup -- packing up the family and moving to a new city. Once Jean and her girls settle in Brooklyn, Holly thinks they should stay for a while, and when Jean's romantic prospects begin to look less than rosy, Holly and her new friend Amy (Vanessa Lengies) decide to invent a secret admirer for her. Needing advice on what the "perfect man" would say and do, Holly and Amy turn to Ben (Chris Noth), Amy's uncle, who talks a very good game when it comes to romance. But convincing Jean that there's a real man behind the steady stream of letters and e-mails from her new admirer isn't as easy as Holly imagines, and it looks as if her imaginary suitor might get in the way of a flesh-and-blood Mr. Right(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">The Four of Us Are Dying</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The Four of Us Are Dying. Once seen in childhood, the January 1, 1960 Twilight Zone episode "The Four of Us Are Dying" can never be forgotten. Set in a surrealistic New York City (replete with flashing neon signs and forced-perspective streets), the story concerns one Arch Hammer (Harry Townes), a two-bit hood gifted with the ability to change his facial features. In rapid succession, he assumes the personalities of two recently deceased individuals -- jazz musician Johnny Foster (Ross Martin) and murdered gangster Virgil Sterig (Phillip Pine) -- for his own financial and sexual gain. But Arch comes to grief when, pursued by Sterig's killers, he transforms his face into that of punkish prizefighter Andy Marshak (Don Gordon). Enchancing the episode's dramatic clout is a brilliant performance by Beverly Garland as a nightclub singer and a driving musical score by Jerry Goldsmith. "The Four of Us Are Dying" was written by Rod Serling from a story by George Clayton Johnson(n)</desc>

The singer performed at Carnegie Hall in New York and the Sydney Opera House, appeared on the Ed O'Sullivan Show and had her own BBC series before giving it all up. The programme explores, in the musician's own words, the story of her early days in Sligo to her current home on the Aran Islands, and how she returned from obscurity - only to then give it all up again for a second time.(n)</desc>
