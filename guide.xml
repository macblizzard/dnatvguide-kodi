For the spot test, the amateurs carve a pattern onto the surface of a Greek urn using a centuries-old technique, and in the throw-down they have just 10 minutes to create the widest bowl they can while blindfolded.(n)</desc>

Meanwhile, Dr Sian Morris believes the reason for a woman's bloated stomach is broccoli - not irritable bowel syndrome or ovarian cancer as her patient fears.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Director Rick Rosenthal, who helmed the very first sequel to Halloween (1978), returns to the horror film series with this eighth entry in the long-running franchise. This time the story line returns to the Haddonfield, IL, family home of serial killer Michael Myers (Brad Loree), now the site of a contest where six college students are dared to spend the night, as their experience is broadcast live on the Internet. Their personalities and motivations are varying: Sara (Bianca Kajlich) is a shy psychology major; Jen (Katee Sackhoff) hopes to launch a broadcasting career; Rudy (Sean Patrick Thomas) is a culinary arts student; Bill (Thomas Ian Nicholas) is a womanizing law student; Jim (Luke Kirby) is a rebellious musician; and Donna (Daisy McCrackin) is a brainy skeptic. Believing that the night is nothing more than a stunt that will provide them with scholarship money, the ill-advised participants are soon shuffling off their mortal coils thanks to Michael's typically ghoulish but creative methods of homicide. In the meantime, Michael's sister, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), is a suicidal mute, incarcerated and hospitalized for the murder of an innocent man she wrongly believed was her brother three years earlier, but a confrontation between the combative siblings is brewing. Halloween: Resurrection (2002) co-stars rapper Busta Rhymes and supermodel Tyra Banks(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Waiting</title>
    <desc lang="en">Learn why you should never send your food back and other valuable lessons in this over-the-top comedy set in the food service industry. Dean (Justin Long) and Monty (Ryan Reynolds) are two longtime friends who work as waiters as Shenanigan's, a self-consciously "fun" chain restaurant. Both have been working at the restaurant since they graduated from high school; it's only recently occurred to Dean that he has nothing to show for the last four years of his life but a community college diploma and his name tag from work, and he's developed a sudden urgency to make something of himself. Monty, on the other hand, is more interested in making time with the women on the wait staff at work than accomplishing anything, though his recent relationship with fellow employee Serena (Anna Faris) has rather dramatically crashed and burned. Over the course of an evening at Shenanigan's, Dean and Monty confront obnoxious customers and train timid new employee Mitch (John Francis Daley) while dealing with wildly eccentric chef Raddimus (Luis Guzman), control-freak manager Dan (David Koechner), and a kitchen full of crazed cooks, prep workers, and dish-washers. Waiting was the first feature film from writer and director Rob McKittrick(n)</desc>

The British were outnumbered by more than 10 to one, but soon pushed the Axis forces back hundreds of miles and Hitler had to send Field Marshal Erwin Rommel and the Afrika Korps to rescue his ally. Alongside the campaign on the ground, Mussolini staged an epic naval and air war in the Mediterranean, which saw the British fighting to hold on to the strategically vital island of Malta.(n)</desc>

On December 7, 1941, the course of the Second World War changed dramatically when Japanese planes swooped in for a surprise attack on the US naval base at Pearl Harbour, Hawaii, which led to America's entry into the conflict. Subsequently Japanese forces seized the British colonies of Malaya and Burma, French Indo-China, the Dutch East Indies, the US-controlled Philippines and a string of Pacific islands.(n)</desc>

On December 7, 1941, the course of the Second World War changed dramatically when Japanese planes swooped in for a surprise attack on the US naval base at Pearl Harbour, Hawaii, which led to America's entry into the conflict. Subsequently Japanese forces seized the British colonies of Malaya and Burma, French Indo-China, the Dutch East Indies, the US-controlled Philippines and a string of Pacific islands.(n)</desc>

The British were outnumbered by more than 10 to one, but soon pushed the Axis forces back hundreds of miles and Hitler had to send Field Marshal Erwin Rommel and the Afrika Korps to rescue his ally. Alongside the campaign on the ground, Mussolini staged an epic naval and air war in the Mediterranean, which saw the British fighting to hold on to the strategically vital island of Malta.(n)</desc>

Years ago, Anton worked with Tony's father to create a new source of energy. But greed got the best of Anton, and now as he slips away, his son, Ivan (Mickey Rourke), vows to make Tony pay for the sins of his father. Meanwhile, Tony fends off efforts from smarmy Senator Stern (Garry Shandling) and military weapons expert Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) to get him to divulge the secrets of his powerful Iron Man suit. The powers that be are concerned that Tony's technology may fall into the wrong hands -- fears that are soon confirmed when the cocky billionaire entrepreneur is confronted in front of the entire world by Ivan, who has built his own weapon using stolen Stark blueprints. Later, as Lt. Rhodes (Don Cheadle) wrestles with the decision to personally deliver Tony's suit to the military, Ivan finds an unlikely ally in the quest to destroy Iron Man; Stark Industries legal consultant Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson) reveals her connection to Nick Fury (Samuel L.

    <title lang="en">Iron Man 2</title>
    <desc lang="en">As Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) owns up to being Iron Man before the world press, Anton Vanko lies dying in Russia. Years ago, Anton worked with Tony's father to create a new source of energy. But greed got the best of Anton, and now as he slips away, his son, Ivan (Mickey Rourke), vows to make Tony pay for the sins of his father. Meanwhile, Tony fends off efforts from smarmy Senator Stern (Garry Shandling) and military weapons expert Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) to get him to divulge the secrets of his powerful Iron Man suit. The powers that be are concerned that Tony's technology may fall into the wrong hands -- fears that are soon confirmed when the cocky billionaire entrepreneur is confronted in front of the entire world by Ivan, who has built his own weapon using stolen Stark blueprints. Later, as Lt. Rhodes (Don Cheadle) wrestles with the decision to personally deliver Tony's suit to the military, Ivan finds an unlikely ally in the quest to destroy Iron Man; Stark Industries legal consultant Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson) reveals her connection to Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson); and Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) takes on some new responsibilities(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Homer at the Bat. Relatively low on the list of annoyances at Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, but a great source of embarrassment to owner C. Montgomery Burns (voice of Harry Shearer), is the traditionally poor performance of the plant's employee softball team. However, when Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) shows up for the first game of the season with a bat he made from a tree branch felled during a thunderstorm (while he unwittingly attracted lightning hiding in a metal shed), he bats in a grand slam, and the team has their best season in memory. Aristotle Amadopolis (also voiced by Castellaneta), the owner of the nearby Shelbyville Nuclear Power Plant, is so impressed with Springfield's winning season that, when his team is to face off against Springfield for the league championship, Amadopolis offers to make things more interesting with a million-dollar wager. Burns, endlessly greedy, is determined to win the bet, and hires a team of ringers to play the big game -- major league stars Wade Boggs, Jose Canseco, Roger Clemens, Ken Griffey Jr., Don Mattingly, Steve Sax, Mike Scioscia, Ozzie Smith, and Darryl Strawberry. However, a bizarre series of disasters sidelines the entire team of all-stars, except for Strawberry, forcing Homer and his pals to win the game on their own. "Homer at the Bat" was first aired on February 20, 1992; by the way, all nine baseball stars who appeared in the episode provided their own voices(n)</desc>

After committing the latest in a long series of safety violations at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) is fired, and while looking for a new career he's enticed by a television commercial into joining the Naval Reserve. Homer persuades his pals Barney Gumble (also voiced by Castellaneta) and Moe Szyslak (voice of Hank Azaria) to sign up with him, and they go into training under the command of Captain Tenille (voice of Rod Steiger). For reasons difficult to fathom, Tenille displays tremendous confidence in Homer, and during war games aboard a submarine he names Homer his second in command. This has unforeseen consequences when Homer accidentally launches the Captain into the ocean along with a torpedo; with Homer in charge, the sub soon springs a leak and veers off course towards Russia, leading the ground crew to conclude that Homer and his crew have turned traitor and are trying to defect. Back in Springfield, Bart (voiced by Nancy Cartwright) ramps up his reputation as a rebel by visiting In 'n' Out Ear Piercing ("If it dangles, we'll punch a hole in it") and getting an earring against the wishes of his folks. "Simpson Tide" was first aired on March 29, 1998 and featured a voice cameo by Bob Denver as himself(n)</desc>

Joyce has organised a special lunch at a trendy gastropub to celebrate Carol and Trevor's 40th wedding anniversary, but her finely tuned plans are somewhat ruined by the arrival of Maureen and her lightweight mother Joan. Carol also looks set to put a dampener on the happy occasion with a rather unfortunate announcement, unless Joyce and Maureen can convince her to change her mind before she lives to regret it. Paula Wilcox, Alison Steadman, Stephanie Beacham, June Whitfield and James Smith star.(n)</desc>

But to crank up the pressure, they bring in guest judge Michael Caines, a chef with a fearsome reputation. Then comes the penultimate challenge, in which they prepare one course each of a three-course meal to be judged by four chefs who each hold the coveted three Michelin stars - Clare Smyth, Jonny Lake, Jocelyn Herland and Jocky Petrie.

Bill's Bait Shop is going under fast, and in order to remain afloat, frazzled owner Bill (Engvall) will have to raise $15,000 in record time. While Bill's family and friends are always willing to lend some moral support, they just don't have the cash needed to bail him out this time around. But Bill has always considered himself an expert fisherman, and soon begins plotting to take top prize in the upcoming annual Bass Tournament. But winning the tournament won't be easy, because Bill's nemesis, rival bait-shop owner Hot Rod Johnson (Cyrus) is entering the competition as well, and he's got a tackle box full of surprises for his longtime opponent. As the lines are cast and the tension grows, Bill remains determined to prove that he still the biggest fish that this small town has to offer(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Jim Carrey and Virginia Madsen star in this dark psychological thriller from director Joel Schumacher. Walter Sparrow is leading a contented life until his wife Agatha innocently gives him a battered old paperback as a gift. As he reads, Sparrow is astonished by the parallels between his life and that of the novel's protagonist, Fingerling. But as the plot progresses it grows darker, featuring themes of transgressive sex, suicide and murder. It also hinges around Fingerling's obsession with the number 23 - a prime number that seems to pop up everywhere in the universe once you start to notice it. It's not long before 23 takes a similar hold on Sparrow. And, when he begins unjustly to view Agatha in the same distrustful light that Fingerling views his own spouse Fabrizia, it seems as if Sparrow has locked on to the same tragic trajectory as the story's lead character. Or can he find a way to wrench himself from the novel's grip?(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Number 23</title>
    <desc lang="en">Jim Carrey and Virginia Madsen star in this dark psychological thriller from director Joel Schumacher. Walter Sparrow is leading a contented life until his wife Agatha innocently gives him a battered old paperback as a gift. As he reads, Sparrow is astonished by the parallels between his life and that of the novel's protagonist, Fingerling. But as the plot progresses it grows darker, featuring themes of transgressive sex, suicide and murder. It also hinges around Fingerling's obsession with the number 23 - a prime number that seems to pop up everywhere in the universe once you start to notice it. It's not long before 23 takes a similar hold on Sparrow. And, when he begins unjustly to view Agatha in the same distrustful light that Fingerling views his own spouse Fabrizia, it seems as if Sparrow has locked on to the same tragic trajectory as the story's lead character. Or can he find a way to wrench himself from the novel's grip?(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The World's End</title>
    <desc lang="en">Five lifelong friends reunite to complete a historic pub crawl from their youth, and find that reaching the fabled World's End tavern will be no simple undertaking while they also fight for the future of all mankind. Twenty years ago, Gary King (Simon Pegg) and his pals embarked on the ultimate drinking marathon. But the beer got the best of them, and they failed to drink their final pint at the World's End pub. Now, as die-hard rebel Gary approaches middle age, he summons his old friends back to their hometown for another round. With each pint down, Gary and the gang take another step toward reconciling with the past. Yet just when it starts to look like their goal is in sight, the pals realize that a much larger struggle is currently taking place, and that the future seems particularly grim -- not only for them, but for the entire human race. Nick Frost, Paddy Considine, Martin Freeman, Eddie Marsan, and Rosamund Pike co-star in the final chapter of Edgar Wright's "Three Flavors Cornetto Trilogy," which began with 2004's Shaun of the Dead and continued in 2007's Hot Fuzz(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">War Elephants</title>
    <desc lang="en">Join brother-and-sister-team Bob and Joyce Poole as they travel to Gorongosa National Park in Mozambique on a simple but dangerous (some would say crazy) mission: to confront traumatized, charging elephants; teach them not to attack people; and convince them that after 16 years of civil war, poaching and destruction, the humans in the park now come in peace and offer protection, not bloodshed and terror. But to get their message across, Bob and Joyce must put themselves in harm's way. Some say elephants never forget, and in Gorongosa National Park, they seem to remember the bullets that killed their family members and the terror that destroyed their culture. Elephant expert and scientist Joyce Poole has been studying these magnificent giants for over 30 years, while Bob, an acclaimed cinematographer, has been filming them for just as long. Their plan is a complex mixture of science and what some might consider insanity: Bob and Joyce will drive directly into the path of charging Gorongosa elephants - and refuse to back down. The hope is to habituate the elephants to people, prove that tourists are not a threat, and hopefully, not get trampled in the process. But when six tons of angry elephant comes charging straight at their vehicle, will Bob and Joyce be able to stay put, or will fear take over? If these elephants really cannot forget the past, the question becomes: Can they forgive?(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Hurricane</title>
    <desc lang="en">In 1966, Rubin "Hurricane" Carter was a top-ranked middleweight boxer whom many fight fans expected to become world champion. When three people were shot to death in a bar in Paterson, New Jersey, Carter and his friend John Artis, driving home from another club in Paterson, were stopped and questioned by police. Although the police asserted that Carter and Artis "were never suspects," a man named Alfred Bello, himself a suspect in the killings, claimed that Carter and Artis were present at the time of the murders. On the basis of Bello's testimony, Carter and Artis were convicted of murder, and Carter was given three consecutive life sentences. Throughout the trial, Carter proclaimed his innocence, saying that his African-American race and work as a civil rights activist were the real reasons for his conviction. In 1974, Bello and Arthur Bradley, who also claimed that Carter was present at the scene of the crimes, recanted their testimony, but Carter and Artis were reconvicted. In the early 1980s, Brooklyn teenager Lesra Martin worked with a trio of Canadian activists to push the State of New Jersey to reinvestigate Carter's case; in 1985, a Federal District Court ruled that the prosecution in Carter's second trial committed "grave constitutional violations" and that his conviction was based on racism rather than facts. Carter was finally freed, and he summed up his story by saying, "Hate got me into this place, love got me out." The Hurricane is based on Carter's incredible true story and stars Denzel Washington as Carter, Vicellous Shannon as Lesra Martin, and John Hannah, Liev Schreiber and Deborah Unger as the Canadian activists.

    <title lang="en">The Hurricane</title>
    <desc lang="en">In 1966, Rubin "Hurricane" Carter was a top-ranked middleweight boxer whom many fight fans expected to become world champion. When three people were shot to death in a bar in Paterson, New Jersey, Carter and his friend John Artis, driving home from another club in Paterson, were stopped and questioned by police. Although the police asserted that Carter and Artis "were never suspects," a man named Alfred Bello, himself a suspect in the killings, claimed that Carter and Artis were present at the time of the murders. On the basis of Bello's testimony, Carter and Artis were convicted of murder, and Carter was given three consecutive life sentences. Throughout the trial, Carter proclaimed his innocence, saying that his African-American race and work as a civil rights activist were the real reasons for his conviction. In 1974, Bello and Arthur Bradley, who also claimed that Carter was present at the scene of the crimes, recanted their testimony, but Carter and Artis were reconvicted. In the early 1980s, Brooklyn teenager Lesra Martin worked with a trio of Canadian activists to push the State of New Jersey to reinvestigate Carter's case; in 1985, a Federal District Court ruled that the prosecution in Carter's second trial committed "grave constitutional violations" and that his conviction was based on racism rather than facts. Carter was finally freed, and he summed up his story by saying, "Hate got me into this place, love got me out." The Hurricane is based on Carter's incredible true story and stars Denzel Washington as Carter, Vicellous Shannon as Lesra Martin, and John Hannah, Liev Schreiber and Deborah Unger as the Canadian activists.

There, the couple are repeatedly warned that the forest can be a dangerous place at night -- warnings that go unheeded by Jim as he single-mindedly focuses on making the journey he's dreamt about for years. Later, in the darkened woods, however, the once-carefree couple experience paralyzing fear when someone -- or something -- begins rooting around their campsite, and uttering inhuman howls. Uncertain if they've actually survived an encounter with Bigfoot or simply fallen victim to a cruel prank by the locals, Jim and Kelly agree to pack their bags, and return to civilization at sunrise.

    <title lang="en">The Hurricane</title>
    <desc lang="en">In 1966, Rubin "Hurricane" Carter was a top-ranked middleweight boxer whom many fight fans expected to become world champion. When three people were shot to death in a bar in Paterson, New Jersey, Carter and his friend John Artis, driving home from another club in Paterson, were stopped and questioned by police. Although the police asserted that Carter and Artis "were never suspects," a man named Alfred Bello, himself a suspect in the killings, claimed that Carter and Artis were present at the time of the murders. On the basis of Bello's testimony, Carter and Artis were convicted of murder, and Carter was given three consecutive life sentences. Throughout the trial, Carter proclaimed his innocence, saying that his African-American race and work as a civil rights activist were the real reasons for his conviction. In 1974, Bello and Arthur Bradley, who also claimed that Carter was present at the scene of the crimes, recanted their testimony, but Carter and Artis were reconvicted. In the early 1980s, Brooklyn teenager Lesra Martin worked with a trio of Canadian activists to push the State of New Jersey to reinvestigate Carter's case; in 1985, a Federal District Court ruled that the prosecution in Carter's second trial committed "grave constitutional violations" and that his conviction was based on racism rather than facts. Carter was finally freed, and he summed up his story by saying, "Hate got me into this place, love got me out." The Hurricane is based on Carter's incredible true story and stars Denzel Washington as Carter, Vicellous Shannon as Lesra Martin, and John Hannah, Liev Schreiber and Deborah Unger as the Canadian activists.

    <desc lang="en">The gang from Friday and Next Friday are back in this urban comedy, in which Craig (Ice Cube) and Day-Day (Mike Epps) have finally moved out of their respective parents' homes and gotten an apartment together. However, a bogus neighborhood Santa Claus (Rickey Smiley) decides to help Craig and Day-Day share the wealth by robbing their apartment, and when he rips off their stereo, he also makes off with their rent money, which was hidden in the speaker cabinets. Desperate to make rent and have some money for Christmas presents, Craig and Day-Day land jobs at a local strip mall, where their fathers, Mr. Jones (John Witherspoon) and Uncle Elroy (Don "D.C." Curry), have gone into business together running a barbecue joint. Craig and Day-Day are installed as security guards, and while Craig tries to make time with Donna (K.D. Aubert), a saleswoman at the Pimp N' Ho's Boutique, and keep things orderly at Holy Moly's Doughnut Shop, Day-Day attempts to transform himself into a master of crime-fighting, which causes a lot more problems than it solves. Friday After Next is the first feature film from director Marcus Raboy, who previously directed music videos for Sting, Li'l Kim, Staind, and Friday After Next star Ice Cube(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">James Vanderbilt wrote and directed this docudrama about the controversial 60 Minutes exposé on then-president George W. Bush's military service that aired just before the 2004 election.

Helmed by first-time feature-film director Giulio Ricciarelli, Labyrinth of Lies is based on the Frankfurt Auschwitz trials, a previously lesser-known chapter of Germany's post-WWII history in which the country was forced to reckon with the Nazis who returned to everyday life following the end of the war.

    <title lang="en">Where Do We Go Now?</title>
    <desc lang="en">Women try to persuade their men to put a stop to war in this fusion of comedy and drama from director, screenwriter, and actress Nadine Labaki. Amale (Labaki) runs a café in a small Lebanese village where the local women, both Christian and Muslim, get together to talk, swap ideas, and share grief as the number who've lost sons or husbands in frequent skirmishes continues to grow. The fighting between religious and political factions has been going on for years, and one day Amale and her friends Afaf (Layla Hakim), Saydeh (Antoinette Noufaily), Takla (Claude Baz Moussawbaa), and Yvonne (Yvonne Maalouf) decide it's time to stop talking about the fighting and do something to bring it to a halt. The local women join forces to distract their men, convinced if they put their minds on other things they won't worry so much about killing. Their efforts range from serving hashish-laced baked goods at a community get-together to hiring Ukrainian dancers to show off their charms to the menfolk. After a young man is killed in a gun battle, the women realize they need to take a stronger stand if they intend to make their home safe again; meanwhile, Christian Amale unwittingly strikes a blow for religious unity when she falls for handsome Muslim Rabih (Julien Farhat). Et Maintenant On Va Ou? (aka Where Do We Go Now?) won the People's Choice Award at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival(n)</desc>

Kenya (Sanaa Lathan) is a successful African-American lawyer in her mid-thirties whose personal life is not going as well as her career.

While attending a party, Kenya is introduced to Brian (Simon Baker), a landscape architect who handles the gardening at her host's mansion. Brian is immediately and obviously attracted to Kenya, through she doesn't feel the same way at all. However, she likes his work and hires him to refurbish her garden; before long, he asks her out on a date, and against her better judgment she accepts. While Kenya and Brian have little in common, in time they hit it off, and a romance begins to blossom between them.

Anthony and his best friend, Julian, have yet to live up to their full potential. When Anthony realizes he's never going to become a five-star chef and Julian grows weary of playing the constant lothario, the two lifelong pals turn to sleuthing to make ends meet. Their first client is a smoldering top-dollar escort with evidence of a high-profile cover-up. At first they do their best to keep control of the situation, but when a shady U.S. senator comes knocking, the mob shows up guns blazing, and a most unusual assassin gets them locked in her sights, the only way to survive is to run like the devil and never look back(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A young man tries to tie up some loose ends before he goes to war in this independent drama from director Neil Abramson. Mike Holland (Nick Cannon) is nineteen years old and has just completed his basic training as a private in the United States Marine Corps. Mike has a four-day leave so he can visit his family for Thanksgiving, and then has orders for combat duty in Iraq. Mike wants to spend time with his family and friends before he ships out, but he doesn't want to tell anyone that he'll be stationed in Iraq. While taking the bus home to Bakersfield, California, Mike meets Cristina (Melonie Diaz), and it doesn't take long for him to realize he's infatuated with her. Mike makes a date to spend some time with Cristina, but he already has a busy schedule over the next four days. Mike catches up with his little sister (Erica Gluck), his doting mother (April Grace) and her taciturn new husband (Tom Sizemore), and sees his estranged father (Chi McBride) for the first time in years. Mike also hangs out with his best friend Jake (Matt O'Leary), but discovers he's begun taking a different path in life while Mike was in boot camp. And Mike happens to meet a disabled soldier back from Iraq (Jay Hernandez) who gives him an idea of what he can expect during his tour of duty. American Son was screened in competition at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Head over Heels</title>
    <desc lang="en">If you think you've seen a man killing someone, does that mean you shouldn't be dating him? This and other questions about modern relationships are explored in this offbeat romantic comedy. Amanda Pierce (Monica Potter) has found a great job (restoring paintings for the Metropolitan Museum of Art) and a great place to live: a spacious East Side apartment that she shares with four successful models, played by Ivana Milicevic, Shalom Harlow, Sarah O'Hare, and Tomiko Fraser. Amanda is still in the market for a great boyfriend, since most of her previous relationships have ended in broken promises or infidelity. She thinks she may have found the right guy in Jim Winston (Freddie Prinze Jr.), but she has reason to believe that he might be guilty of murder. Since she's not sure he has actually done anything, she decides to find out the truth, and her investigation has unexpectedly comic consequences. Head Over Heels was directed by Mark S. Waters, whose first feature, The House of Yes, also starred Freddie Prinze Jr.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Day After Tomorrow</title>
    <desc lang="en">Roland Emmerich's blockbuster stars Dennis Quaid as climatologist Jack Hall; a lone voice predicting that global warming will lead to a new ice age. He is ridiculed for his views, but his fears swiftly come true when a dramatic temperature rise in the Antarctic causes the world's weather to go mad, with tornadoes devastating Los Angeles, Britain literally flash-frozen and New York first inundated by floods and then overwhelmed by a killer cold snap. A few survivors, including Jack's son Sam, take refuge in a library and Jack sets out on a desperate mission to save them. The action-packed film (which won a BAFTA for its stunning special effects) may have compressed and dramatised the effects of global warming but, disturbingly, the basic science Emmerich uses in the film to advance the plot isn't that far removed from the increasing dangers the world faces today(n)</desc>

Playful Elmo (voice of Kevin Clash) loves his blue blanket and would never want to lose it. So when it gets spirited off to parts unknown in the midst of a tug-of-war with one of his friends, Elmo sets out to find it and ends up in the grumpy kingdom of Grouchland, where Huxley (Mandy Patinkin) and the Queen of Trash (Vanessa Williams) rule over a dark and ill-mannered domain. Along with Elmo, several other favorite Sesame Street characters appear, including Oscar the Grouch (Carroll Spinney), Ernie (Steve Whitmire), and Bert (Frank Oz)(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Day After Tomorrow</title>
    <desc lang="en">Roland Emmerich's blockbuster stars Dennis Quaid as climatologist Jack Hall; a lone voice predicting that global warming will lead to a new ice age. He is ridiculed for his views, but his fears swiftly come true when a dramatic temperature rise in the Antarctic causes the world's weather to go mad, with tornadoes devastating Los Angeles, Britain literally flash-frozen and New York first inundated by floods and then overwhelmed by a killer cold snap. A few survivors, including Jack's son Sam, take refuge in a library and Jack sets out on a desperate mission to save them. The action-packed film (which won a BAFTA for its stunning special effects) may have compressed and dramatised the effects of global warming but, disturbingly, the basic science Emmerich uses in the film to advance the plot isn't that far removed from the increasing dangers the world faces today(n)</desc>

Danny and Wheeler make their living promoting a high-energy drink to pupils as a wholesome alternative to drugs. The job fits perfectly with uber-slacker Wheeler's rock'n'roll lifestyle, while cynical Danny, whose focus is his girlfriend Beth, feels like his life is dribbling away. However, neither of them can find the motivation to grab life by the scruff - until, one day, they deliberately crash their truck and are given the choice between jail or community service. They choose the latter, becoming mentors to a 10-year-old breast-obsessed lad called Ronnie and teenage role-play gamer Augie. It's difficult to tell whose behaviour is worse, the children or the 'adults', but a battle of wills ensues, which will have a meaningful outcome for all four of them..(n)</desc>

After a walk on the pier with Brian (MacFarlane), he decides to become a fisherman. "That's how a real New England man makes his living," he reasons. He buys a boat at a police auction for 50,000 dollars, only to learn that its previous owner, Salty, died while chasing after "Daggermouth," the man-eating bluefish. Peter then goes to "Jim's Bank" for a loan so he can pay for his boat. He soon runs into conflict with Henessey, a veteran fisherman who resents the newcomer. Peter's having a hard time earning a living, and to make matters worse, he failed to read the loan papers he signed, and the bank is repossessing everything the family owns. Meanwhile, Meg (voice of Mila Kunis) is distraught about missing out on spring break. In an effort to placate her, Lois (voice of Alex Borstein) takes her to a fancy spa. When that doesn't do the trick, Lois drives Meg to spring break. Meg is embarrassed to be seen there with her mother, and it only gets worse when Lois parties her way to popularity among Meg's peers, neglecting her daughter in the process. While Lois and Meg negotiate their bacchanal, Peter is desperate to come up with the money to keep their home from being taken by the bank. When he learns that there's a 50,000-dollar bounty on Daggermouth, he and his friends set out to capture the dreaded beast.
