    <desc lang="en">Although the once-hot game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? had lost its luster as a prime-time ABC offering, the producers felt that there was enough life left in the property to warrant a Monday-through-Friday syndicated version. Taking over from the earlier series' host Regis Philbin was Meredith Vieira of The View. To make certain that the series would not be bankrupted after its first week on the air, the questions posed to contestants were considerably harder than those on the prime-time incarnation. Also, the famous "fastest finger" round was eliminated, taking some of the pressure off the contestants when they struggled to come up with answers. The most noteworthy change from the original version was the absence of Regis Philbin's familiar catchphrases: One would never hear Meredith Vieira chime in with the legendary "Is that your final answer?"

F/X technician Patrick Tatopoulos (Godzilla, Independence Day) steps out of the effects lab and into the director's chair with this entry, which sees stars Bill Nighy returning as Viktor, the king of his vampire clan and father to Sonja (Rhona Mitra), a free-minded heir who tests her parent by heading outside of their castle's borders and doing battle with the ravenous werewolves of the surrounding area. Sonja also has a secret love affair with Lucian (Michael Sheen), the first of the Lycans, a race of lycanthropes who were bred by the vampires to be slaves and protectors to the bloodsucking clan. As the news of their love spreads to Viktor, ranks of the vampire elite help Lucian escape, leading to a revolution of the Lycans against their masters and setting up the mythology of the later latexed adventures featured in Len Wiseman's two previous films(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">DIY SOS highlights the plight of nation's 250,000 young carers, who look after their parents on a daily basis. Blackpool Carers Trust, which is supported by funding from Children in Need, provides limited out-of-school respite and training activities for some of these carers - but its current centre is bursting at the seams. It has now inherited a run-down property, which is bigger but will require the renovation of a neglected building and a huge overgrown garden - and that's where Nick and the team come in, with help from designer Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Beach</title>
    <desc lang="en">For his first major project after the overwhelming success of Titanic, Leonardo Di Caprio took a risky path in this adaptation of Alex Garland's acclaimed novel, directed by Danny Boyle. Richard (Di Caprio) is an American backpacking through Asia with a handful of friends from Europe. While in Bangkok, he meets a mad Scotsman who calls himself Daffy Duck (Robert Carlyle). Shortly before Mr. Duck kills himself, he gives Richard a crude map to a place in Thailand that he claims is paradise on earth: beautiful, unspoiled, and uninhabited. For lack of anything better to do, Richard and his companions try to locate the spot, which, after a dangerous and taxing journey, takes them to a beach as beautiful as Duck said it would be. Richard and his friends settle in, but before long they discover that they are not alone; a large group of fellow travelers has already dug themselves in, and they have established a community with the same social evils that Richard was hoping to leave behind. Just as important, there is an army of natives who grow marijuana in the nearby hills and do not appreciate the presence of these visitors. The Beach proved controversial during production, partly due to production delays and shifting release dates, partly due to environmental concerns after crew members bulldozed parts of the Thai island of Phi Phi Le for the planting of non-native trees(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Equilibrium</title>
    <desc lang="en">(2002) In the near future, following the Third World War, the population of the nation of Libria must take the drug Prozia II to suppress the emotions their ruler Dupont (Angus Macfadyen) believes caused the war. To prevent violation of the law, enforcement officers called Grammatons punish anyone that shows signs of emotion. But when one of them, John Preston (Christian Bale), forgets his dose, the scales fall from his eyes and he discovers a rebel group who have kept art and literature alive. However, they are under threat; can he help them survive? Kurt Wimmer's sci-fi film, like Fahrenheit 451, concentrates primarily on raising moral and ethical issues, although there are also spectacular Gun-Kata fights, where special techniques allow combatants to anticipate the path of bullets and avoid them.

Crunch Calhoun (Kurt Russell) has a reputation for big stunts, and hard landings. Now that years of motorbike mishaps have taken their toll on the aging Crunch, he is tempted back into a life of crime in order to make a buck. Unfortunately, Crunch isn't the best when it comes to choosing his criminal cohorts, and he winds up in prison after being double-crossed by his scheming half-brother Nicky (Matt Dillon). His retirement fund depleted by the time he's released, Crunch sets his sights on one last score that will set him up for life. The mission: Assemble a team, steal the Guttenberg Bible, replace it with a counterfeit, and collect a cool $20 million. With his apprentice Francie (Jay Baruchel), the well-connected Paddy Kenneth Walsh, expert forger Guy (Chris Diamantopoulos), and idea man Nicky by his side, Crunch begins preparations for the job he'll be remembered for. The heist hits the skids, however, when untrustworthy Nicky resorts to his old tricks. But this time Crunch is ready, and as their partnership dissolves he prepares to pull out his ace in the hole.

    <desc lang="en">This comedy is quite a change for Hong Kong martial arts hero Jet Li. Li plays Chow, the writer of a pulp-style adventure serial, who seems to be failing in both his career and his marriage to Monica (Rosamund Kwan). The film also enacts out Chow's story as he writes it: Li also plays the fictional Dr. Wai, a daring adventurer in the tradition of Doc Savage or Indiana Jones. As Chow tries to churn out his story, Dr. Wai pursues a mysterious scroll called "The Scripture Without Words"; the film's transitions between reality and fantasy is reminiscent of films such as Brazil and The Princess Bride(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Art of the Steal</title>
    <desc lang="en">An art thief-turned-motorcycle daredevil pulls his old crew back together for one last heist in this caper film from writer/director Jonathan Sobol (A Beginner's Guide to Endings). Crunch Calhoun (Kurt Russell) has a reputation for big stunts, and hard landings. Now that years of motorbike mishaps have taken their toll on the aging Crunch, he is tempted back into a life of crime in order to make a buck. Unfortunately, Crunch isn't the best when it comes to choosing his criminal cohorts, and he winds up in prison after being double-crossed by his scheming half-brother Nicky (Matt Dillon). His retirement fund depleted by the time he's released, Crunch sets his sights on one last score that will set him up for life. The mission: Assemble a team, steal the Guttenberg Bible, replace it with a counterfeit, and collect a cool $20 million. With his apprentice Francie (Jay Baruchel), the well-connected Paddy Kenneth Walsh, expert forger Guy (Chris Diamantopoulos), and idea man Nicky by his side, Crunch begins preparations for the job he'll be remembered for. The heist hits the skids, however, when untrustworthy Nicky resorts to his old tricks. But this time Crunch is ready, and as their partnership dissolves he prepares to pull out his ace in the hole. Terence Stamp and Katheryn Winnick co-star(n)</desc>

First the audience sees his violence and poverty-ridden project; next his go-nowhere delinquent friends are introduced, as is their hobby: joy riding. Soon some of the teens, including Jason, begin to convert their hobby into a part-time job as they steal cars and sell them to a sleazy chop-shop owner for pennies on the dollar. Eventually, luck runs out when they are caught in a police sting; one boy is shot to death by the crooked Officer Roscoe (Saul Stein), who then warns Jason not to tell a soul; however, they continue stealing cars. Meanwhile, Jason beats up a neighborhood acquaintance on the playground for a slight to his sister and finds himself the target of the boy's murder attempts. The action draws to a head as both Roscoe and the vengeful boy close in(n)</desc>

Simon (Bill Paxton) seduces Helen with the lie that he is a secret agent; he's really a used car salesman. Harry suspects that Helen is cheating on him, and he sends a few colleagues to kidnap them. Helen then discovers that Harry is a secret agent by night, working for a shadowy group called the Omega Sector. Harry and his partner Gib (Tom Arnold) are trying to find four nuclear warheads that have disappeared from a former Soviet republic(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Three men relive their carefree college years by killing off as many brain cells as possible in this over-the-top comedy. Mitch (Luke Wilson) returns home from a less-than-pleasant business trip one evening to discover his wife, Heidi (Juliette Lewis), involved in a ménage à trois with two blindfolded strangers. Feeling less than welcome at home after this, Mitch rents a house near the campus of a nearby college; two of Mitch's old college buddies, Beanie (Vince Vaughn) and Frank (Will Ferrell), stop by to cheer him up. They soon become regular guests at Mitch's place, despite the fact that Frank only recently wed Marissa (Perrey Reeves), while Beanie and his wife, Lara (Leah Remini), are busy with two kids. Beanie decides to throw a housewarming party for Mitch, and since Beanie sells audio equipment for a living, he's able to trick out the big bash with a massive PA system and an appearance by Snoop Dogg. Mitch soon finds he's the not-entirely-willing proprietor of the school's leading party spot, which raises the ire of Pritchard (Jeremy Piven), a dean at the college who was the target of Mitch, Frank, and Beanie's abuse when they were all students. Pritchard arranges to have Mitch's neighborhood zoned into a student housing district, but Beanie and Frank respond by forming a fraternity and making Mitch's home their headquarters. Mitch, however, is not enthusiastic about the idea, especially as he's trying to impress Nicole (Ellen Pompeo), a beautiful divorcee who is less than enchanted with Frank and Beanie's "party hearty" lifestyle. Old School director Todd Phillips knows more than a bit about the seamy side of fraternity life as director of the infamous unreleased documentary Frat House(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A moment of temptation leads to a high body count and untold regrets for a high-school swimming star in this thriller starring Bring It On's Jesse Bradford and Traffic's Erika Christensen. Despite a shady past involving drugs and the juvenile justice system, Ben Cronin (Bradford) seems to have it all: a loving mother, a devoted girlfriend (Shiri Appleby), and a shot at a college scholarship in California. But the same week that athletic scouts will be deciding his future, Ben finds himself embroiled in a flirtation with Madison Bell (Christensen), a bewitching transfer student who seduces him into supposedly strings-free sex during an impromptu swim lesson after hours in the school pool. When Ben takes Madison at her word and goes about his business as if nothing had happened, she insinuates herself into his life with sinister glee. Showing up at Ben's house, befriending his girlfriend, and sending him naked pictures -- none of her strategies wins his heart. So Madison turns to other, more devious forms of courtship. Soon, Ben finds himself kicked off the swim team for supposed steroid use, suspected of murdering a rival (Clayne Crawford), and rejected by his girlfriend for his sexual indiscretions. Eventually, though, he receives help in uncovering the genesis of Madison's uncanny fixation from an unexpected source. Originally titled "Swimfan85" (after Madison's Internet screen name), the retitled Swimfan hit the top spot at the back-to-school box office when it was released September 6, 2002. Dan Hedaya co-stars as Ben's stern but loving mentor, Coach Simkins. Actor-turned-director John Polson previously helmed Siam Sunset(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Three men relive their carefree college years by killing off as many brain cells as possible in this over-the-top comedy. Mitch (Luke Wilson) returns home from a less-than-pleasant business trip one evening to discover his wife, Heidi (Juliette Lewis), involved in a ménage à trois with two blindfolded strangers. Feeling less than welcome at home after this, Mitch rents a house near the campus of a nearby college; two of Mitch's old college buddies, Beanie (Vince Vaughn) and Frank (Will Ferrell), stop by to cheer him up. They soon become regular guests at Mitch's place, despite the fact that Frank only recently wed Marissa (Perrey Reeves), while Beanie and his wife, Lara (Leah Remini), are busy with two kids. Beanie decides to throw a housewarming party for Mitch, and since Beanie sells audio equipment for a living, he's able to trick out the big bash with a massive PA system and an appearance by Snoop Dogg. Mitch soon finds he's the not-entirely-willing proprietor of the school's leading party spot, which raises the ire of Pritchard (Jeremy Piven), a dean at the college who was the target of Mitch, Frank, and Beanie's abuse when they were all students. Pritchard arranges to have Mitch's neighborhood zoned into a student housing district, but Beanie and Frank respond by forming a fraternity and making Mitch's home their headquarters. Mitch, however, is not enthusiastic about the idea, especially as he's trying to impress Nicole (Ellen Pompeo), a beautiful divorcee who is less than enchanted with Frank and Beanie's "party hearty" lifestyle. Old School director Todd Phillips knows more than a bit about the seamy side of fraternity life as director of the infamous unreleased documentary Frat House(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A moment of temptation leads to a high body count and untold regrets for a high-school swimming star in this thriller starring Bring It On's Jesse Bradford and Traffic's Erika Christensen. Despite a shady past involving drugs and the juvenile justice system, Ben Cronin (Bradford) seems to have it all: a loving mother, a devoted girlfriend (Shiri Appleby), and a shot at a college scholarship in California. But the same week that athletic scouts will be deciding his future, Ben finds himself embroiled in a flirtation with Madison Bell (Christensen), a bewitching transfer student who seduces him into supposedly strings-free sex during an impromptu swim lesson after hours in the school pool. When Ben takes Madison at her word and goes about his business as if nothing had happened, she insinuates herself into his life with sinister glee. Showing up at Ben's house, befriending his girlfriend, and sending him naked pictures -- none of her strategies wins his heart. So Madison turns to other, more devious forms of courtship. Soon, Ben finds himself kicked off the swim team for supposed steroid use, suspected of murdering a rival (Clayne Crawford), and rejected by his girlfriend for his sexual indiscretions. Eventually, though, he receives help in uncovering the genesis of Madison's uncanny fixation from an unexpected source. Originally titled "Swimfan85" (after Madison's Internet screen name), the retitled Swimfan hit the top spot at the back-to-school box office when it was released September 6, 2002. Dan Hedaya co-stars as Ben's stern but loving mentor, Coach Simkins. Actor-turned-director John Polson previously helmed Siam Sunset(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Hollywoodland</title>
    <desc lang="en">The mysterious and unexpected death of an iconic Hollywood star may be just the tip of an iceberg of scandal in this showbiz drama based on a true story. George Reeves (played by Ben Affleck) was a journeyman actor who had played a small role in Gone With the Wind and appeared onscreen with the likes of James Cagney, Rita Hayworth, and Marlene Dietrich, but his career was not exactly booming when he was cast as comic-book hero Superman in a 1951 B-movie, Superman and the Mole Men. A year later, the producers of the movie launched a syndicated Superman television series with Reeves returning as "The Man of Steel." The show became a major hit, and Reeves was a star at last. However, on June 16, 1959, to the shock of many, Reeves was found dead of a gunshot wound. Police soon declared Reeves' death a suicide and closed the case, but his mother (Lois Smith) refused to believe her son took his own life, and hired Louis Simo (Adrien Brody), a private detective, to find out the truth about her son's passing. Simo found that many Hollywood insiders did not care to cooperate as he researched the Reeves case, but his digging uncovered plenty of evidence suggesting the actor did not take his own life, and he also revealed one of Reeves' deepest secrets -- while he was engaged to marry a pretty young starlet, Leonore Lemmon (Robin Tunney), Reeves was also carrying on an affair with the beautiful Toni Mannix (Diane Lane), the wife of Eddie Mannix (Bob Hoskins), a powerful and ill-tempered executive at MGM. While the producers of Hollywoodland based their story on factual accounts of the investigation into the death of George Reeves, they were denied permission to use the Superman logo and the familiar introduction to the Adventures of Superman television show by the respective copyright holders(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Inspired by a true story, the film follows the heroism of Captain Alexei Vostrikov who, at the height of the Cold War, is ordered to take command of the nuclear missile submarine K-19 away from its original commander Captain Mikhail Polenin. Vostrikov's mission is to quickly ready the ill-prepared sub for her maiden voyage - no matter what the cost. But Vostrikov, Polenin and K-19's loyal crew can never imagine all that is expected of them. Neither can they fathom what the price of failure might be for them and for the world when a nuclear reactor malfunctions, threatening a core meltdown and an explosion that will certainly kill all aboard. As they glide beneath the Arctic seas, it is the crew's collective bravery and Vostrikov's daring embrace of his duty toward his country and his men which will ultimately save K-19... and stave off what surely would have been a nuclear disaster(n)</desc>

Twenty years later, after saying 'yes' to their respective fiancés, they've instructed their wedding planner to book the ceremony of their dreams.

    <title lang="en">Hollywoodland</title>
    <desc lang="en">The mysterious and unexpected death of an iconic Hollywood star may be just the tip of an iceberg of scandal in this showbiz drama based on a true story. George Reeves (played by Ben Affleck) was a journeyman actor who had played a small role in Gone With the Wind and appeared onscreen with the likes of James Cagney, Rita Hayworth, and Marlene Dietrich, but his career was not exactly booming when he was cast as comic-book hero Superman in a 1951 B-movie, Superman and the Mole Men. A year later, the producers of the movie launched a syndicated Superman television series with Reeves returning as "The Man of Steel." The show became a major hit, and Reeves was a star at last. However, on June 16, 1959, to the shock of many, Reeves was found dead of a gunshot wound. Police soon declared Reeves' death a suicide and closed the case, but his mother (Lois Smith) refused to believe her son took his own life, and hired Louis Simo (Adrien Brody), a private detective, to find out the truth about her son's passing. Simo found that many Hollywood insiders did not care to cooperate as he researched the Reeves case, but his digging uncovered plenty of evidence suggesting the actor did not take his own life, and he also revealed one of Reeves' deepest secrets -- while he was engaged to marry a pretty young starlet, Leonore Lemmon (Robin Tunney), Reeves was also carrying on an affair with the beautiful Toni Mannix (Diane Lane), the wife of Eddie Mannix (Bob Hoskins), a powerful and ill-tempered executive at MGM. While the producers of Hollywoodland based their story on factual accounts of the investigation into the death of George Reeves, they were denied permission to use the Superman logo and the familiar introduction to the Adventures of Superman television show by the respective copyright holders(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Inspired by a true story, the film follows the heroism of Captain Alexei Vostrikov who, at the height of the Cold War, is ordered to take command of the nuclear missile submarine K-19 away from its original commander Captain Mikhail Polenin. Vostrikov's mission is to quickly ready the ill-prepared sub for her maiden voyage - no matter what the cost. But Vostrikov, Polenin and K-19's loyal crew can never imagine all that is expected of them. Neither can they fathom what the price of failure might be for them and for the world when a nuclear reactor malfunctions, threatening a core meltdown and an explosion that will certainly kill all aboard. As they glide beneath the Arctic seas, it is the crew's collective bravery and Vostrikov's daring embrace of his duty toward his country and his men which will ultimately save K-19... and stave off what surely would have been a nuclear disaster(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Ladies' Man</title>
    <desc lang="en">Comedian Jerry Lewis began directing movies in 1960, and this often unkind satire on the nature of American womanhood is one of his early efforts in that regard. The rubber-legged, rubber-faced Lewis plays Herbert, a man who is despondent over the break-up of his romance. While looking for a job, he comes across an impressive mansion (built as a set at the cost of $350,000) filled with women of all types -- and lo and behold -- they need a handyman. So Herbert gets to reside with a bevy of women of various types, all under the supervision of Mrs. Wellenmelon (Helen Traubel). In the end, the set itself outtrumps them all(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">It's said that most American men think about sex once every two or three minutes, but this statistic would seriously underestimate the horniness of Jim (Jason Biggs), a high school senior in suburban Michigan. Jim is thoroughly obsessed with sex, a fact of which his parents become aware when they discover him performing the sin of Onan with a gym sock while watching scrambled pay-per-view porn. Jim's buddies Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), and Oz (Chris Klein) are no less anxious to relieve themselves of their virginity, so they all make a pledge: they will go to bed with a woman in the three weeks before senior prom or die trying. Kevin appears to have the advantage, since he already has a girlfriend, Vicky (Tara Reid), but before he ventures into the Final Frontier, Kevin is urged to consult "The Bible," a hand-written how-to manual possessing erotic wisdom passed down through the ages. Oz is a good-looking jock who is actually a nice guy -- which is part of the problem, since he has his heart set on a nice girl, Heather (Mena Suvari), who does not seem the type to leap into bed within 21 days. Finch has no immediate prospects, though Jessica (Natasha Lyonne) is in a position to know if those rumors about him are true. And Jim is a truly hopeless case -- after his attempted seduction of beautiful Czech exchange student Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) turns out to be a disaster, he ends up going to the prom with Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), an annoyingly chatty band geek who does, however, have a fascinating story about a flute.

    <title lang="en">Drumline</title>
    <desc lang="en">After decades of movies about college sports, the bands who take the field at halftime finally get their day in the sun in this musical comedy drama. Devon Miles (Nick Cannon) is a talented young percussionist from Harlem who wins a music scholarship to Atlanta A &amp; T, a prestigious African-American university. For years, Atlanta A &amp; T has won awards for their show-style marching band, who combine expert musicianship (incorporating funk, R&amp;B, and jazz rhythms into the traditional marching band repertoire) with choreography, dancing cheerleaders, and roof-raising showmanship. Dr. Aaron Lee (Orlando Jones), the school's band director, gives Devon a spot in the marching band's drumline, the heart and soul of a show-style band, but discovers Devon's previous musical education hardly meets his usual standard when he learns that his new drummer can't read music. Devon soon earns a reputation as a stubborn individualist within the band, not necessarily a good thing in an ensemble where a strictly unified performance is considers the ideal. Devon's cocksure attitude and streetwise style doesn't mesh very comfortably with Sean Taylor (Leonard Roberts), a disciplined senior who resents the presence of the upstart freshman in the drumline, and things become even less harmonious when Devon begins making a play for Laila (Zoe Saldana), a beautiful girl who is also being courted by Sean. Songwriter and record producer Dallas Austin, who has worked with Boyz II Men, TLC, and Pink, served as executive producer for Drumline, helped produce the film's musical score, and contributed his own experiences as a marching band member to the screenplay(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Coraline</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Henry Selick (The Nightmare Before Christmas; James and the Giant Peach) delivers a deliciously dark stop-motion animated adventure for children who don't mind a scare or two, based on Neil Gaiman's much-praised book. Coraline Jones and her parents have just moved into the Pink Palaces Apartments in Oregon, where they find themselves surrounded by eccentric neighbours, including a pair of ageing burlesque performers. It should be an exciting time, but Coraline's parents are too busy working as horticultural journalists to spend any time with her, so she is deeply bored. That is until she discovers a mysterious door that only appears after dark. Bold and inquisitive, the youngster investigates. She discovers a brightly coloured alternative universe, where her 'Other Mother' has plenty of time to play with her and her neighbours' quirks are charmingly exaggerated; in fact, she's tempted to stay. But all is not as it seems: everyone in the new world has buttons for eyes - and the operation to install them involves knitting needles. And that revelation is just the first of her shocking discoveries about the true nature of her apparent idyll... So, there's definitely good reason for that PG certificate, though children who can cope with the story of Hansel and Gretel shouldn't find anything too disturbing here. Selick's film won great critical acclaim, and scooped festival prizes around the world, as well as picking up an Oscar nomination and winning the 2009 BAFTA Children's Award. Also featuring the voices of Keith David, Robert Bailey Jr and Ian McShane(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Georgia Rule</title>
    <desc lang="en">Jane Fonda, Felicity Huffman, and Lindsay Lohan star in director Garry Marshall's tale of a rebellious young woman who is sent to spend the summer with her grandmother when her frustrated mother fails to find a means of curbing her unruly behavior. Rachel (Lohan) is an out-of-control teen whose reckless drinking, foul mouth, and hysterical fits have become a constant source of embarrassment for her long-suffering mother, Lily (Huffman). When Rachel crashes her car, Lily determines that the only way to tame her savage daughter is to take her as far away from San Francisco as possible. Though Lily had once sworn never to return to the Idaho farm presided over by her demanding mother, Georgia (Jane Fonda), desperation has a funny way of dulling the pains of the past, and it's not long before Lily is packing Rachel in the car and setting out for potato country. Contrary to the common image of the sweet and doting grandmother, Georgia is a stern matriarch whose beliefs in the power of God and a hard day's work stand in stark contrast to the carefree lifestyle of the tempestuous Rachel. An interesting thing happens as the summer wears on, though; despite her initial efforts to disrupt the quiet Mormon community, Rachel's rage is gradually tempered as she learns the value of structure and responsibility. Later, as Rachel's protective walls begin to crumble and she begins to embrace compassion and kindness, the doors are opened for three generations of family to confront the long-buried secrets of their past and finally move forward in the healing process(n)</desc>

Three decades after a childhood tragedy that destroyed his love of Christmas, cynical Michael Walker still loathes the sound of carols, and the sight of Old St. Nick. Try as his spirited wife (Connie Britton) and family might, they still can't get Michael into the holiday spirit. Meanwhile, as the snow begins to fall, misfortune strikes Michael's family, prompting the concerned father to reflect on his troubled past. Just when Michael's future looks to be teetering on the brink of disaster, however, a benevolent stranger (Willie Nelson) bestows his family a lavish new home under the one condition that they join in their new neighborhood's Christmas festivities. In the process, the man who forgot how to feel joy rediscovers that wide-eyed child who ran down the stairs every Christmas morning eager to see what Santa had left him under the tree. Kris Kristoferson and Lyle Lovett co-star(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Punch Drunks. While this was the second short that The Three Stooges shot for Columbia, this one is the first where they use their own names (and, thankfully, they don't have to talk in couplets, like they did in their first, Woman Haters). Stooge Moe Howard plays a down-on-his-luck fight manager. While eating at a restaurant with some cronies, he finds himself a new fighter -- their waiter (Curly Howard). When a hungry violinist (Larry Fine) offers to play for some soup and begins a lively rendition of "Pop Goes the Weasel," Curly goes into a conniption fit that would soon become classic Stooge fare -- slapping his face, dancing around and "Woop-wooping" wildly. Before anyone can move, he's knocked out all of Moe's pals -- and the restaurant's manager. Moe grabs both Curly and Larry and the trio work their way up in the boxing world -- until one bout in which an accident breaks Larry's violin. Curly takes a brutal beating from Killer Kilduff while Larry runs all over town! looking for something -- anything -- that is playing "Pop Goes the Weasel." He finds a politician's campaign truck blaring the tune from its speakers and races it to the arena in time for Curly to win the fight. In fact, the song -- and Curly's fit -- doesn't stop until Moe and Larry also wind up in a heap in the ring. The Stooges would use this same gag -- Curly stimulated into going nuts -- in at least two other films, 1935's Horses' Collars and 1937's Grips, Grunts and Groans(n)</desc>

Crossing crocodile-infested waters on a quest to reach Duba Island, the fiercely protective mother discovers that in order for her family to survive, she must conquer a herd of buffalos with piercing horns. Later, in an incredible turn of fate, Ma di Tau forges a fragile alliance with a rival pride in order to wage a desperate battle to preserve their bloodline in the face of certain extinction(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Glasgow Ucos.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">In a special edition of the detective drama that features only two members of the team, Gerry Standing and Steve McAndrew travel to Glasgow, where a new Ucos section is being set up. While there, they agree to assist the investigation into the 1993 unsolved murder of James Soutar, the wealthy owner of a string of betting shops. Cathy Sinclair, one of the beneficiaries of the bookie's will at his death, had a care-home upbringing in common with Soutar, but she claims to have no idea who he was or why she was left £15,000. McAndrew has a personal stake in the case - the original investigating officer was corrupt cop Frank McNair, who had an affair with his wife, and their paths soon cross. The London-based officers' questions begin to unsettle someone and a campaign of victimisation against them begins, but it's a revelation from McAndrew's girlfriend Charley that reawakens a long-dormant scandal and clears the path to a solution. Dennis Waterman and Denis Lawson star.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">MasterChef</title>
    <desc lang="en">The four heat-winners enter the quarter-final, in which they face the Critic's Brief. Guest judge Tracey MacLeod provides a simple instruction for a main dish - the twist being, the amateur cooks don't know who has set it until they face the Independent's restaurant critic to hear her verdict. It's then back to the kitchen to prepare a dessert, again based on MacLeod's brief. This time, the one that doesn't make the grade fails to reach the knockout week.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The dangerous patients at a maximum-security mental hospital break free from their rooms during a power failure, and embark on a grisly murder rampage that's destined to be remembered as one of the worst ever committed. Fifteen years ago, an elusive serial killer known as The Wolf claimed the lives of 15 young girls. Thanks to the work of Detectives Elliott Carbon (John Rhys-Davies) and Johnny Morgan ( Andrew Cymek), The Wolf was eventually captured, locked up, and placed in the care of Dr. Parker (William B. Davis). When the facility loses power and the lights go dark, however, The Wolf and the rest of the inmates seize the opportunity to reclaim their freedom. Now trapped in these winding corridors with a rampaging gang of maniacs, madmen, and murderers, Johnny and Dr. Parker must fight to survive the night, and ensure that no one escapes before order is restored(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">High Tension</title>
    <desc lang="en">French filmmaker Alexandre Aja writes and directs the slasher film Haute Tension, given the English title Switchblade Romance. Best friends Marie (Cécile De France) and Alex (Maïwenn Le Besco) go out to the countryside to visit Alex's parents. However, a homicidal delivery man (played by Philippe Nahon from Gaspar Noé's brutal movies) ends up at their house and starts killing everyone. Alex and Marie fight for their lives with help from several means of weaponry. Switchblade Romance was shown at the 2003 Toronto Film Festival as part of the Midnight program. The film was aquired by US distributor Lions Gate Films in 2004 and quickly put into turnaround as an NC-17 release, though plans for that were scrapped due to a lack of theater support of the controversial rating. Retitled High Tension, the R-rated version is missing one minute of grisly gore and features a redubbed audio track by star Cécile De France(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Delta Farce</title>
    <desc lang="en">When a hard-luck blue-collar worker and his two best friends are mistaken for Army Reservists by a tough-talking Army sergeant, the plane set to fly them to the front lines of Iraq mistakenly drops them in the middle of Mexico to disastrous results in a freewheeling military comedy starring Larry the Cable Guy, Bill Engvall, and D.J. Qualls. Larry (the Cable Guy) has lost his job and his woman in the short span of 24 hours. Convinced that some suds and target shooting are just the right remedies for a broken, jobless heart, Larry sets out with his next-door neighbor Bill (Engvall) and their trigger-happy pal Everett (Qualls) in order to blast off some rounds and down some brews. Their relaxing weekend soon takes an unexpected turn, however, when hard-case Army sergeant Kilgrove (Keith David) mistakes the trio as slacking Army reservists and loads them in a plane bound for Fallujah. Subsequently air-dropped over Mexico due to pilot error, the clueless, wannabe war heroes become convinced that they're actually in the Middle East and set out to save a rural village from what they assume to be an insurgent uprising. Though the thankful locals champion the noble but dimwitted trio for their heroism, the celebration is short-lived as ruthless warlord Carlos Santana (Danny Trejo) pays a personal visit to the town with a plan to confront the fearless warriors who dared to challenge his iron-fist rule(n)</desc>

After eight years of grifting, Mickey is ready for retirement but has one final target in his sights - crooked businessman Madani Wasem, who could give him and the others a £10million payday in a stock-market scam.

Steve Barker (Johnny Knoxville) is an office drone who wants to move up the corporate ladder, but when he asks his boss for a promotion, it comes with a condition -- Steve has to fire Stavi (Luis Avalos), who has been the firm's janitor for years. Steve decides to soften the blow by hiring Stavi to do his lawn and garden work. However, an accident robs Stavi of several of his fingers, and since he doesn't have medical insurance, Steve needs to find a way to pay for his surgery. Steve's uncle Gary (Brian Cox), a sleazy type who will bet on anything, also needs some fast cash, and comes up with a get-rich-quick scheme -- Steve was a track star in high school, and with the Special Olympics Championships coming up, all Steve has to do is pretend to be mentally challenged, enter the competition, and win the running events against six-time medalist Jimmy (Leonard Flowers). Gary will bet big on Steve, and the odds will allow them to clean up. Steve is appalled by the idea, but he needs the money badly enough to go along. However, Steve discovers that Jimmy is fast enough that he has little chance of beating him. However, Jimmy's colossal ego has made him many enemies among his fellow Special Olympians, and they're eager enough to see him taken down a peg that they help Steve train for the big event.

    <title lang="en">The Ringer</title>
    <desc lang="en">A guy trying to do the right thing ends up taking part in one of the most morally dubious con games in history in this comedy. Steve Barker (Johnny Knoxville) is an office drone who wants to move up the corporate ladder, but when he asks his boss for a promotion, it comes with a condition -- Steve has to fire Stavi (Luis Avalos), who has been the firm's janitor for years. Steve decides to soften the blow by hiring Stavi to do his lawn and garden work. However, an accident robs Stavi of several of his fingers, and since he doesn't have medical insurance, Steve needs to find a way to pay for his surgery. Steve's uncle Gary (Brian Cox), a sleazy type who will bet on anything, also needs some fast cash, and comes up with a get-rich-quick scheme -- Steve was a track star in high school, and with the Special Olympics Championships coming up, all Steve has to do is pretend to be mentally challenged, enter the competition, and win the running events against six-time medalist Jimmy (Leonard Flowers). Gary will bet big on Steve, and the odds will allow them to clean up. Steve is appalled by the idea, but he needs the money badly enough to go along. However, Steve discovers that Jimmy is fast enough that he has little chance of beating him. However, Jimmy's colossal ego has made him many enemies among his fellow Special Olympians, and they're eager enough to see him taken down a peg that they help Steve train for the big event. Matters become all the more complicated when Steve becomes infatuated with Lynn (Katherine Heigl), a beautiful woman who has volunteered to help the challenged athletes, and would doubtless be furious if she found out what Steve was really doing. Produced by Peter Farrelly and Bobby Farrelly, The Ringer was the first fiction directorial credit for Barry W. Blaustein; the story also parallels a 2004 episode of the animated television series South Park, "Up the Down Steroid."(n)</desc>

Later, Burtom overhears himself insulted by a drunken Maurice and gives chase, forcing Arthur and Maurice to hide in a box. When they awaken, the box has been moved onto a luxury liner bound for France. To evade Burtom, they pose as stewards, meeting passengers and crew members: Staff director Meistrich (Campbell Scott) fancies head stewardess Lily (Lili Taylor), who goes for ship detective Marco (Matt McGrath). Others on board include Greek wrestling enthusiast Sparks (Billy Connelly); a former European queen (Isabella Rossellini); a suicidal lounge vocalist (Steve Buscemi); and a revolutionary (Tony Shalhoub) planning to bomb the liner.

    <title lang="en">Fresh</title>
    <desc lang="en">Justifiably hailed as one of the most powerful and innovative films of 1994, screenwriter Boaz Yakin's directorial debut offers a wrenching portrait of a 12-year-old African American boy struggling to survive in a Brooklyn ghetto. The story unspools slowly with a sprawling, nearly silent panorama of the boy's daily life. Fresh (Sean Nelson in his feature film debut) is first seen walking to school, and but for stopping to pick up a delivery from a local drug dealer, he seems like any other boy. While Fresh may appear young and inexperienced, one look into his intelligent, sensitive but street-hardened eyes shows that he is old beyond his years. Shrewd, hard-working and loyal, Fresh is a taciturn youth, and this earns him the respect of the rival drug dealers for whom he works. Both kingpins have become his mentors, and he seems destined to become just like them. Sometimes, Fresh goes to Washington Square to play chess for money. He is a remarkable player, but is no match for his beer-swilling, unemployable father (Samuel L. Jackson), a world class chess player who never had the chance to compete. A ruthless player, his father gives Fresh invaluable advice about the game's nature and ultimately about life itself. Those words come in handy when a schoolyard crisis prompts Fresh to began planning his cold-blooded, methodical escape from ghetto life. During the film, one waits for the stereotypes, the cartoonish two-dimensional characters, inevitable moralizing against an unjust, oppressive society, and the glorified, graphically violent action sequences punctuated by the pounding beat of angry rap music, but Fresh studiously avoids such cliches. The characters are three-dimensional and presented with little judgment; the drug lords are bad men, but they are also very human. His sister is on a ruinous road, but she is not a purely tragic victim. When violence occurs it is ingloriously swift and ugly. Percussionist Stuart Copeland's soundtrack subtly underscores the action(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Backstage</title>
    <desc lang="en">In 1998, rapper Jay-Z's third album, Vol. 2: Hard Knock Life made him one of hip-hop's biggest crossover acts, with the single "Hard Knock Life" becoming a major hit on radio and the sales charts. In 1999, Jay-Z, who also runs the hip-hop oriented Rock-A-Fella Records label, launched a major concert tour, in which he joined forces with fellow rappers Method Man, DMX, and Redman for a road trip that packed halls at 54 shows in two months, earning $18 million at the turnstiles. This documentary takes a close look at the music Jay-Z and his friends created onstage, as well as their adventures -- both positive and negative -- as they take one of rap's biggest shows on the road. Hard Knock Life Tour also features new music from The Lox, Memphis Bleek, and T-Boz from the R&amp;B group TLC. Incidentally, if the title sounds a bit familiar to non-rap fans, it may be because it was sampled from a song featured in the musical Annie(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Transporter 2</title>
    <desc lang="en">Driver and muscle for hire Frank Martin returns in this sequel to the 2002 box-office hit. Frank Martin (Jason Statham) is a former special-forces officer who will transport anything anywhere for a price, and his latest assignment is acting as chauffeur for Jack Billings (Hunter Clary), the young son of politician Jefferson Billings (Matthew Modine), who has garnered no small amount of controversy for his aggressive efforts to stamp out the trade in illegal drugs. One day, Frank is to take Jack to the doctor for a checkup while his mother, Audrey (Amber Valletta), sets up a birthday party for the tyke. However, Jack's doctor is not who he appears to be -- he's actually Dimitri (Jason Flemyng), a Russian agent well versed in viruses who works with criminal kingpin Gianni (Alessandro Gassman). After a long and hard-fought chase with Frank, the bad guys get ahold of little Jack and hold him for ransom. The parents comply with their monetary demands and soon have their son back at home -- but little do they know that the boy has secretly been injected with a deadly and easily spread virus, which the terrorists hope to spread to the boy's powerful father and other politicians whom Jefferson will soon be addressing at a public event. When Frank learns what has happened to young Jack, he sets out to find the culprits -- and the antidote that will save the boy and all others who have been exposed to the virus from dying a painful death -- though his foes have stacked the deck so that it looks as if Frank has been complicit in the crime(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Quality of Mercy. In the last days of WWII, "90-day wonder" Lieutenant Katell (Dean Stockwell) takes charge of a battle-weary American squadron somewhere in the Pacific Theater. With the arrogance of inexperience, Katell demands that Sgt. Causarano (Albert Salmi) lead an attack against a group of wounded and dispirited Japanese soldiers -- "They are the enemy! First day of the war or the last day of the war!" But a sudden wrinkle in time causes Lt. Katell -- or should we say "Lt. Yamuri" -- to experience an epiphany. Future Star Trek stalwart Leonard Nimoy plays a small role as a radio operator. Scripted by Rod Serling from an idea by Sam Rolfe (Have Gun, Will Travel, Man from U.N.C.L.E. et al.), "A Quality of Mercy" was Twilight Zone's Yuletide offering for the 1961-62 season, making its first appearance on December 29, 1961(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Dud Bowl II. Marcy (Amanda Bearse) is appalled when the bank where she works (Kyoto National) announces plans to donate a scoreboard to Polk High School--to be named after the school's greatest football hero, Al Bundy (Ed O'Neill). Determined to cheat Al of this honor, Marcy thinks she has found a loophole when she discovers that former Super Bowl champ Terry Bradshaw once attended Polk High for two whole months. Listen as the studio audience cheers when Bradshaw (as himself) invokes memories of the "immaculate reception" of 1972. This episode was originally telecast in tandem with Al Bundy's Sports Spectacular, a montage of sports-related clips from past Married. . .With Children installments hosted by Roy Firestone(n)</desc>
