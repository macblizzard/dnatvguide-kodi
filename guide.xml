    <title lang="en">To Be or Not to Be</title>
    <desc lang="en">Mel Brooks and his wife Anne Bancroft co-star in this funny remake of a 1942 comedy of the same title, based on a story by Ernst Lubitsch and Melchior Lengyel about a down-and-out Warsaw theater troupe who save the Polish resistance fighters from the SS in World War II. Frederick Bronski (Brooks) leads a struggling theatrical company that offers anything -- from excerpts of Hamlet to stock vaudeville -- if it will pull in an audience. Unknown to Frederick, his wife Anna Bronski (Anne Bancroft) starts up an extra-marital interest in a Polish pilot (Tim Matheson) that could lead to a large-scale disaster. The pilot unknowingly reveals the names of the Bronskis and several resistance fighters to an SS spy (José Ferrer), and by the time he finds out what he has done, he is in London, so he is forced to return surreptitiously to Warsaw as fast as he can to stop the list of names from landing in the hands of the SS chief (Charles Durning). Once the theater troupe is called in to help on this mission, the comedy begins in earnest with the actors donning the guise of Nazis, and Anna seguing into "seductions" of the SS spy and his chief as a part of their battle plan(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Austin Powers -- fashion photographer, denizen of Swingin' London, international espionage agent, and bane of dental hygienists everywhere -- returns in his second screen adventure. Powers (once again played by Mike Myers), a 1960s superspy stranded in the 1990s, discovers that his nemesis, criminal genius Dr. Evil (also Mike Myers), has somehow stolen his "mojo" (the secret to his otherwise inexplicable sex appeal) and traveled back in time to the 1960s as part of his latest fiendish scheme. Powers must also travel back in time to retrieve it, but if Austin doesn't quite fit into 1998, he's been there just long enough not to fit in in 1968 anymore, either. Powers also discovers that Dr. Evil has new allies this time: Mini-Me (Verne Troyer), a clone of Dr. Evil one-eighth his size but just as nasty; Fat Bastard (Myers yet again), whose name describes him just fine; and vixenish assassin Robin Swallows (Gia Carides). Powers' lack of mojo also proves troublesome when he's paired with his new partner, saucy CIA operative Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham). Other characters returning from the first film include Elizabeth Hurley as Vanessa Kensington, Robert Wagner as Number Two, Michael York as Basil Exposition, Seth Green as Scott Evil, and Mindy Sterling as Frau Farbissina. Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me also includes cameo appearances from Tim Robbins, Jerry Springer, Woody Harrelson, and Burt Bacharach with his current songwriting partner, Elvis Costello(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Marin Cilic v Roger Federer. Sue Barker presents coverage of the men's singles final on Centre Court at SW19. Croatian Cilic has reached only his second Grand Slam final, having previously appeared in - and won - the showpiece match at the 2014 US Open. Legendary Swiss player Federer is looking for a record eighth triumph at Wimbledon, and 19th Major overall. Home favourite Andy Murray picked up his second Wimbledon title here in 2016, defeating Canada's sixth seed Milos Raonic 6-4, 7-6, 7-6 to claim his third major title overall, following his famous triumph here over Novak Djokovic in 2013 and the 2012 US Open, when he defeated the same player in the final. The Scot is currently world number one and came into this tournament as top seed, so hopes were high a fortnight ago for another strong run at his home event.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Fiona Bruce and art experts Philip Mould and Bendor Grosvenor come to the aid of a man who has inherited three paintings that he believes were painted by LS Lowry. However, he cannot prove whether they are the genuine article, and since Lowry is the British artist whose work is most frequently forged, it will take a great deal of evidence to convince the art establishment of their value. The search for the truth leads to a discovery that challenges established beliefs about the artist's life.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The documentary focuses on small creatures in an urban setting. In Rio de Janeiro, marmosets use power-lines as they would tree branches to scour the streets for food, and one animal becomes separated from its group and is forced to the ground, where it confronts the dangers of the city alone. Almost 11,000 miles away in the neon metropolis of Tokyo, a rhinoceros beetle begins an extraordinary journey to find sanctuary on a rare patch of greenery, along the way facing predatory bats, eight-eyed jumping spiders, praying mantises and a sharp-eyed crow. Including Hidden Kingdoms Revealed, showing how the film was made. Narrated by Stephen Fry. Last in the series.(n)</desc>

These so-called `divas' are more than willing to throw tantrums, manipulate relatives and resort to emotional blackmail to get what they want. Among the pampered persons highlighted are shopping-obsessive Janey, who withholds sex from her fiance as a means of getting access to his bank account, and ambitious teen Romy, who demands her mother supply her with a `big budget' wardrobe to match her big dreams. Also featured is apprentice hairdresser Matthew, who plans to emulate the camp excess of Lady Gaga as a performer, much to the dismay of long-suffering boyfriend Dylan.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Longest Yard</title>
    <desc lang="en">One of the toughest and best-remembered sports movies of the 1970s gets a humorous makeover in this comedy. Paul "Wrecking" Crewe (Adam Sandler) was once a famous professional football player, but after several years out of the limelight and an alcohol problem have taken their toll, Crewe is arrested for a serious traffic accident aggravated by the fact he was drunk. Crewe is sentenced to Allenville Penitentiary, where Warden Hazen (James Cromwell) is something of a football fan. Hazen had organized his guards into an impressive football team, and clears a healthy profit by taking bets on their games. Looking to make the competition more interesting, Hazen suggests that Crewe put together a team from the inmate population to play his guards. With the help of fellow prisoner Caretaker (Chris Rock), Crewe recruits the heaviest hitters from the cell block for the team, but the guys don't play like a unit until Crewe and Caretaker get some help from Nate Scarborough (Burt Reynolds), a former college and NFL coach doing hard time. Adapted from Robert Aldrich's 1974 box-office smash of the same name, The Longest Yard also features rap star Nelly and Nicholas Turturro; the film has previously been loosely remade in 2001 as Mean Machine, with the action moved to England and the game changed to soccer(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Walk the Line</title>
    <desc lang="en">James Mangold's Walk the Line tells the life story of country music legend Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix), focusing primarily on the long courtship he had with June Carter (Reese Witherspoon). The film is structured as an extended flashback opening with Cash readying to take the stage at his historic Folsom Prison Concert. The film touches on his childhood, relating a horrific early incident from his life and establishing the troubled relationship he would have with his father (Robert Patrick). Cash joins the military and leaves home. During his time in the armed services he begins writing songs and romances a hometown girl (Ginnifer Goodwin). After the end of his duty he settles down and attempts to begin a music career, but his wife has trouble adjusting to his dreams. Cash auditions for Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts), signs to Sun Records, and soon finds himself on tour with a roster of young soon-to-be legends that includes Elvis Presley (Tyler Hilton) and Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Malloy Payne). On this tour he meets June Carter, the daughter of the famous Carter family, and they take a liking to each other, although she refuses any serious advances from him. Cash gains world-wide fame thanks in part to the inspiration he gets from June, but eventually his marriage crumbles and he develops a serious drug addiction. The film is based on Cash's autobiographies.

    <title lang="en">Walk the Line</title>
    <desc lang="en">James Mangold's Walk the Line tells the life story of country music legend Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix), focusing primarily on the long courtship he had with June Carter (Reese Witherspoon). The film is structured as an extended flashback opening with Cash readying to take the stage at his historic Folsom Prison Concert. The film touches on his childhood, relating a horrific early incident from his life and establishing the troubled relationship he would have with his father (Robert Patrick). Cash joins the military and leaves home. During his time in the armed services he begins writing songs and romances a hometown girl (Ginnifer Goodwin). After the end of his duty he settles down and attempts to begin a music career, but his wife has trouble adjusting to his dreams. Cash auditions for Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts), signs to Sun Records, and soon finds himself on tour with a roster of young soon-to-be legends that includes Elvis Presley (Tyler Hilton) and Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Malloy Payne). On this tour he meets June Carter, the daughter of the famous Carter family, and they take a liking to each other, although she refuses any serious advances from him. Cash gains world-wide fame thanks in part to the inspiration he gets from June, but eventually his marriage crumbles and he develops a serious drug addiction. The film is based on Cash's autobiographies. Phoenix and Witherspoon performed all of their own singing in the movie, just as Sissy Spacek and Beverly D'Angelo did in Coal Miner's Daughter a quarter-century before(n)</desc>

By the time the United States became involved in World War II, John Ford was already a film legend, but when Uncle Sam came calling the veteran filmmaker eagerly packed his bags and set his sites on the frontlines. Though Ford did sustain battlefield injuries during the production of the Oscar-winning documentary The Battle of Midway, the remarkable film endeared him to patriotic American audiences across the country and his next wartime effort, 1943's December 7th, proceeded to earn the filmmaker yet another Oscar. In addition to featuring footage from these and other, lesser-known wartime films from Ford, this documentary also offers an intimate look at the complex filmmaker and explores his remarkable legacy through both archive footage and interviews with such notable directors as Oliver Stone and Peter Bogdanovich(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Armando Iannucci's political satire returns with long-suffering MP Peter Mannion taking charge at the Department of Social Affairs and Citizenship as part of a coalition government. However, he must also work with junior minister Fergus Williams - an arrangement neither man is enjoying. As the series begins, Fergus excitedly prepares to launch his new digital education initiative - until Downing Street spin doctor Stewart Pearson announces technophobe Peter is going to be the spokesman for it instead. Elsewhere in the department, civil servant Terri Coverley tries to ensure she is put up for redundancy, while her colleague Glenn Cullen attempts to make his presence felt. Starring Roger Allam, Geoffrey Streatfeild, Vincent Franklin and Joanna Scanlan.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Golden Compass</title>
    <desc lang="en">Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig and Dakota Blue Richards star in Chris Weitz's family fantasy-adventure, based on the first book in Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy. Twelve-year-old orphan Lyra Belacqua lives in an Oxford college, where the staff do their best to push her enquiring mind down conventional educational routes. One day, having sneaked into a private meeting of the college's dons, Lyra learns of mysterious events taking place in the Arctic. Soon after, amid news of mysterious child abductors called the 'Gobblers', her best friend Roger (Ben Walker) vanishes. The fearless Lyra sets off, determined to rescue her playmate. But Lyra's is a parallel universe: one with Victorian-style technology; where people's souls take the visible form of character-suggesting animals; witches and talking, armoured polar bears rule the cold lands of the north; and an organisation called The Magisterium aims to assert its authority. Lyra's journey will prove a dangerous one that uncovers the terrible truth linking the Gobblers and the Arctic phenomenon she heard about in Oxford. Also starring Eva Green, and the voices of Freddie Highmore and Ian McKellan. Sadly, it now seems the following two films in the series are fated not to be made. Even so, this stands as a stirring, thoughtful family adventure that's reasonably true to Pullman's masterpiece(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Golden Compass</title>
    <desc lang="en">Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig and Dakota Blue Richards star in Chris Weitz's family fantasy-adventure, based on the first book in Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy. Twelve-year-old orphan Lyra Belacqua lives in an Oxford college, where the staff do their best to push her enquiring mind down conventional educational routes. One day, having sneaked into a private meeting of the college's dons, Lyra learns of mysterious events taking place in the Arctic. Soon after, amid news of mysterious child abductors called the 'Gobblers', her best friend Roger (Ben Walker) vanishes. The fearless Lyra sets off, determined to rescue her playmate. But Lyra's is a parallel universe: one with Victorian-style technology; where people's souls take the visible form of character-suggesting animals; witches and talking, armoured polar bears rule the cold lands of the north; and an organisation called The Magisterium aims to assert its authority. Lyra's journey will prove a dangerous one that uncovers the terrible truth linking the Gobblers and the Arctic phenomenon she heard about in Oxford. Also starring Eva Green, and the voices of Freddie Highmore and Ian McKellan. Sadly, it now seems the following two films in the series are fated not to be made. Even so, this stands as a stirring, thoughtful family adventure that's reasonably true to Pullman's masterpiece(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Scream 3</title>
    <desc lang="en">Wes Craven's Scream (1996) was a half-parody/half-tribute to the first wave of slasher films of the 1970s and 1980s, and since most of them spawned a large number of sequels, it's only appropriate that Craven and screenwriter Kevin Williamson produced a third installment of their Scream franchise. Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), traumatized by the brutal murders of her friends, has left her hometown of Woodsboro and is working in California as a crisis intervention counselor. Meanwhile, "Stab," the novel by Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox Arquette), is spawning a series of successful horror films, and as Stab 3: Return to Woodsboro is being filmed in Los Angeles, a lunatic has gotten his hands on a copy of the script, and is murdering the characters in the same order that they die in the movie. But predicting who will die next is not as simple as it might seem, since the producers have circulated three different screenplays, with different endings. In addition to Campbell and Cox-Arquette, David Arquette returns from the first two films as less-than-bright "Dewey" Riley; new members of the cast include Parker Posey, Patrick Dempsey, Scott Foley, and Jenny McCarthy. Kevin Williamson wrote the original story, but the screenplay was penned by Ehren Kruger(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Towelhead</title>
    <desc lang="en">Six Feet Under creator and American Beauty screenwriter Alan Ball makes his feature directorial debut with this screen adaptation of author Alicia Erian's controversial novel Towelhead. Jasira (Summer Bishil) is a 13-year-old Arab-American who's contending with the pains of adolescence when her life takes a sudden and unexpected turn. Sent to live with her stern Lebanese father, Rifat (Peter Macdissi), by her self-absorbed mother (Maria Bello), Jasira finds herself struggling to adjust to life in the suburbs while contending with racism and hypocrisy at every turn. Rifat lives in a modest, suburban Houston home next to racist reservist Mr. Vuoso (Aaron Eckhart) and meddling expectant mother Melina (Toni Collette). Adjusting to life in the suburbs isn't easy for young Jasira, though she tries her hardest to adapt to the unfamiliar environment by striking up casual conversations with her curious new neighbors. In the process, Jasira finds herself increasingly attracted to hormone-driven African-American teen Thomas (Eugene Jones). When Rifat finds out that his daughter's new boyfriend is black, he vehemently condemns the relationship. As America launches its initial invasion of Iraq, Jasira finds herself caught up in a potentially explosive situation that is only compounded by her raging hormones and the snooping of her pregnant, busybody neighbor(n)</desc>

As the others continue on to the big game, Carly and Wade make their way into the closest town, Ambrose, and discover it's all but deserted, except for a local tourist attraction, the House of Wax. However, it isn't long before they find out why the wax sculptures at the museum look so freakishly real, and discover a pair of murderous brothers are keen on making them part of the next exhibit. House of Wax is an in-name-only remake of the well-remembered 1953 3-D horror outing starring Vincent Price, which was in turn based on the 1933 picture Mystery of the Wax Museum(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Mom at Sixteen</title>
    <desc lang="en">The new girl in town is 16-year-old Jacey Jeffries (Danielle Panabaker), who lives with her divorced mother, Terry (Mercedes Ruehl), and her two siblings. A popular and highly intelligent student, not to mention a talented athlete, Jacey nonetheless seems to be harboring a private, profound sadness -- or at least that's the perception of her high-school guidance counselor, Donna Cooper (Jane Krakowski). Ultimately Donna figures out the truth behind Jacey's melancholia: her baby "brother" Charlie is actually her own son, born out of wedlock and raised by Jacey's overbearing mother in a misguided effort to shield her daughter from disgrace. Upon discovering Jacey's secret, Donna takes a special interest in the girl's welfare -- an interest undoubtedly fueled by the fact that Donna herself is unable to have children. The scenes taking place in the sex-education class have an air of reality often lacking in made-for-TV films, due to the fact that the young actors playing the students were encouraged to improvise their dialogue. Produced for the Lifetime cable network, Mom at Sixteen first aired on March 21, 2005(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Tony Robinson and the team search for the remains of a Norman castle in Dundrum, Co Down, one of Northern Ireland's most picturesque counties, exploring a territory established by renegade knight John de Courcy in the 12th century against the orders of King John. The castle was later rebuilt, and much of its replacement is still standing, but the experts are convinced that some of what remains dates from de Courcy's time - and discover that it may go back even further.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Tony Robinson and the team try to piece together the complete picture of the Manor of the More, a once impressive structure masterminded by Henry VIII's right-hand man, Cardinal Wolsey. The palace had been forgotten about until the 1950s, when a group of pupils at Northwood School in Hertfordshire discovered its remains beneath a playing field. One of them joins the team on an adventure of discovery, observing remains dating back to the 16th century.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">More than a decade ago, Kevin McCloud visited Brighton to meet a co-operative of 10 families, including former travellers and single parents, who were building their own and each other's homes, with the promise that the council would allow them to live in the finished properties at a reduced rent. For two years they laboured, balancing a 30-hour week with various other commitments. Now the presenter returns to see whether the houses, and the community that built them, have stood the test of time.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Documentary examining the famous Second World War evacuation of Allied soldiers - codenamed Operation Dynamo - from the beaches of Dunkirk, France, between May 26 and June 4, 1940. Recently released Ministry of Defence files reveal that, far from being absent as many historians have believed, the RAF was suffering massive losses supporting the evacuation. Operating at high altitude and deep inside France, RAF planes were halting the bulk of Luftwaffe bombers before they could reach the beaches. The files also reveal that the famous Spitfire took flight for the first time during the mission, and the agile fighter was a spectacular success.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me</title>
    <desc lang="en">This dark drama is the prequel to the TV series, Twin Peaks, also by director David Lynch. A woman who seems to be innocent and pure by day leads a double life in a rural community where quite a bit of evil lurks just beneath the surface of an otherwise typical American small town. As she was sexually abused throughout her childhood by her possessed father, Laura has some obvious sexual problems and is heavily addicted to cocaine. This film tells of the bizarre and twisted circumstances that led to her murder--which was where the television series began(n)</desc>

A hapless electronics store employee who spends most of his spare time downing pints at the local pub with his roommate, Ed (Nick Frost), Shaun's life seems to fall apart when he is dumped by his girlfriend, Liz (Kate Ashfield), and his obnoxious stepfather, Philip (Bill Nighy), shows up to berate him for not being more attentive to his caring mother Barbara (Penelope Wilton) -- especially since he forgot to send flowers for her birthday. Things take a turn for the worse when the dead return to stake their claim on the Earth, and though the chaos that follows threatens to swallow up all of England, it's up to Shaun to keep his cool and prove himself once and for all by successfully rescuing Liz and his mother. With his trusty roommate by his side, nothing -- not even the living dead -- can stand between Shaun and the two most important women in his life(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">House of D</title>
    <desc lang="en">Actor David Duchovny made his debut as a director and screenwriter with this coming-of-age drama, in which a grown man looks back at his adolescence. It's 1973, and Tommy (Anton Yelchin) is a 13-year-old boy living in New York's Greenwich Village with his mother (Téa Leoni), who is still coming to terms with the death of her husband. Tommy's best friend is Pappass (Robin Williams), a mentally challenged man who is in his thirties, but is at the same emotional age as Tommy; Pappass delivers meat for a local butcher, and Tommy helps him out. Tommy has discovered women, and has a crush on Melissa (Zelda Williams), a cute girl in his class, but Pappass isn't much interested in the opposite sex, and can offer little advice on the subject. Tommy's lone confidante on this issue is Lady Bernadette (Erykah Badu), a woman locked up in the nearby Women's House of Detention who offers advice shouted from her window. When Pappass begins to realize that Tommy is falling for Melissa, he's convinced he's losing his best friend, and in a moment of anger he steals a bicycle. Tommy tries to protect Pappas by claiming he was the thief, leading to a series of serious repercussions. Years later, Tommy (now played by Duchovny) is a grown man who leaves his home in Paris, France, to pay a visit to the old neighborhood and come to terms with the life he left behind(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">House of D</title>
    <desc lang="en">Actor David Duchovny made his debut as a director and screenwriter with this coming-of-age drama, in which a grown man looks back at his adolescence. It's 1973, and Tommy (Anton Yelchin) is a 13-year-old boy living in New York's Greenwich Village with his mother (Téa Leoni), who is still coming to terms with the death of her husband. Tommy's best friend is Pappass (Robin Williams), a mentally challenged man who is in his thirties, but is at the same emotional age as Tommy; Pappass delivers meat for a local butcher, and Tommy helps him out. Tommy has discovered women, and has a crush on Melissa (Zelda Williams), a cute girl in his class, but Pappass isn't much interested in the opposite sex, and can offer little advice on the subject. Tommy's lone confidante on this issue is Lady Bernadette (Erykah Badu), a woman locked up in the nearby Women's House of Detention who offers advice shouted from her window. When Pappass begins to realize that Tommy is falling for Melissa, he's convinced he's losing his best friend, and in a moment of anger he steals a bicycle. Tommy tries to protect Pappas by claiming he was the thief, leading to a series of serious repercussions. Years later, Tommy (now played by Duchovny) is a grown man who leaves his home in Paris, France, to pay a visit to the old neighborhood and come to terms with the life he left behind(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Assault on Precinct 13</title>
    <desc lang="en">(2005) Jean-François Richet's remake of John Carpenter's 1976 cult classic rivals the original for tension and action. Ethan Hawke plays Jake Roenick, a police sergeant in charge of closing down defunct cop shop Precinct 13 with old timer Jasper O'Shea (Brian Dennehy) and secretary Iris Ferry (Drea de Matteo). But a bus taking drugs lord Marion Bishop (Laurence Fishburne) to prison is caught up in traffic chaos and he and the other prisoners are dumped on Roenick and his team. Bishop is due to give evidence that would expose cop corruption at the highest level and when Marcus Duvall (Gabriel Byrne), one of those under threat, finds out where Bishop is being held, he gathers a gang to take him out. And only Roenick and his rag-bag of cons, cops and civilians can stop them. M,W,R,S,,HD(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">New York City, 1863. Before there was the city we know today, a city of wealth, power and infinite dreams, New York was a very different place, a fledgling young city where the desire for a better life raged in crime-ridden streets. Here, as the Nations own survival was being tested by the ongoing Civil War, a vast and dangerous underworld was born in the streets. These were the gangs of New York, as portrayed in Herbert Asburys classic book, whose racketeering, bootlegging, swindling, gambling and murdering would become legendary - and whose culture of corruption threatened the very survival of Americas working people. In the young, unfinished City, it was a time of ruthlessness, intolerance and fear. But it was also a time of extraordinary bravery, as those pushed to the edge fought for the freedom of future generations. Director Martin Scorsese sets this epic drama in this defining moment in New York City history, an era whose conflicts helped define who and what makes an American. Against the backdrop of this brave new world unfolds a story about a fatherless sons search for honor, vengeance and the courage to remake his life(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">New York City, 1863. Before there was the city we know today, a city of wealth, power and infinite dreams, New York was a very different place, a fledgling young city where the desire for a better life raged in crime-ridden streets. Here, as the Nations own survival was being tested by the ongoing Civil War, a vast and dangerous underworld was born in the streets. These were the gangs of New York, as portrayed in Herbert Asburys classic book, whose racketeering, bootlegging, swindling, gambling and murdering would become legendary - and whose culture of corruption threatened the very survival of Americas working people. In the young, unfinished City, it was a time of ruthlessness, intolerance and fear. But it was also a time of extraordinary bravery, as those pushed to the edge fought for the freedom of future generations. Director Martin Scorsese sets this epic drama in this defining moment in New York City history, an era whose conflicts helped define who and what makes an American. Against the backdrop of this brave new world unfolds a story about a fatherless sons search for honor, vengeance and the courage to remake his life(n)</desc>

At the same championship is Lizzie Bradbury (Kirsten Dunst), heading for stardom and dating the American, Jake Hammond (Austin Nichols), another great figure in the circuit. But Peter and Lizzie happen to meet one day and their destiny starts to look different from what seemed unchangeable(n)</desc>

Anthony and his best friend, Julian, have yet to live up to their full potential. When Anthony realizes he's never going to become a five-star chef and Julian grows weary of playing the constant lothario, the two lifelong pals turn to sleuthing to make ends meet.

Alex (Allen Covert) is a 35-year-old video-game fanatic who gave up a career in accounting to take a job testing games for Brainasium, the company behind the wildly popular game "Eternal Death Slayer." While Alex took a big pay cut to land his dream job, he's happy with his work and is making ends meet -- until he discovers that his roommate hasn't paid the rent for the last six months, using the money to finance repeated visits to a local massage parlor. After running out of friends who will let him sleep on their couch, Alex swallows his pride and moves in with his grandma Lily (Doris Roberts), who loves Alex and is happy to give him a place to stay in exchange for doing chores around the house. Lily shares her home with two friends, perpetually confused Bea (Shirley Knight) and sexually adventurous Grace (Shirley Jones), and between the three of them, there's always work to be done, keeping Alex busy nearly every night. While Alex tells his co-workers he's living with three attractive women who are running him ragged, they don't know the real story; in the meantime, Alex is trying to charm Brainasium's beautiful new executive, Samantha (Linda Cardellini), while butting heads with the firm's space-case CEO Cheezle (Kevin Nealon) and J.P.

Alec Baldwin plays Mackin, a career thief who picks his jobs shrewdly and carefully, and prefers to spend his downtime with his collection of rare jazz LP's and looking after his dog. Pointy (Michael Jai White) is a young upstart gangster trying to develop a taste for refinement and the good life. When Pointy sets up Mackin, Mackin is forced to retaliate, and before long both men and their associates are in the middle of a war neither is especially interested in winning, which begins to escalate in comic fashion. The skirmish eventually attracts the attention of a female cop (Rebecca De Mornay) who's become interested in Mackin's method of operation.

    <title lang="en">Redbelt</title>
    <desc lang="en">Tim Allen and Chiwetel Ejiofor co-star in writer/director David Mamet's martial arts drama Redbelt. Ejiofor plays Mike Terry, a jujitsu master who co-runs a very modest martial arts studio in Los Angeles with his bossy wife, Sondra (Alice Braga). Mike demonstrates an unwavering commitment to his craft and draws a cadre of defiantly loyal pupils including Joe (Max Martini), an LAPD cop. All told, it appears that he has chosen a peaceful and conflict-free path in life. The dedicated martial artist's fate takes an unanticipated turn, however, one evening when a young woman named Laura (Emily Mortimer) bursts into the academy in a state of near hysteria, and reaches for a policeman's gun when he tries to restrain her. One thing leads to another, and before long, Laura is regularly receiving martial arts lessons from Mike. As master begins to teach pupil and his martial arts philosophies emerge, his path also crisscrosses with that of a Hollywood movie star, Chet Frank (Tim Allen), when he saves the fellow from a beating at a local club and gets invited (along with Sondra) to Chet's house for dinner. Chet extends gestures of friendship, and Mike's guard breaks down; he speaks openly and candidly of a special martial arts method he employs that requires one of the participants to "assume a handicap." In time, the association with Chet leads to involvement in the motion-picture industry, and relations with a bevy of characters who aren't exactly what they seem -- including a pay-per-view fight mogul (Ricky Jay) and Chet's slimy and manipulative manager (Joe Mantegna)(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Last Supper</title>
    <desc lang="en">If you met Adolph Hitler when he was just a struggling cartoonist, wouldn't you have done the world a big favor by murdering him? That philosophical question provides the linchpin of this black comedy. Jude (Cameron Diaz), Pete (Ron Eldard), Paulie (Annabeth Gish), Marc (Jonathan Penner), and Luke (Courtney B. Vance) are five graduate students who are confirmed members of the political left, participate in small-scale activism, and share a house together. One night, Pete is stuck in the middle of nowhere, and Zack (Bill Paxton), a truck driver, gives him a lift home. The housemates are just about to sit down to dinner, so to show his gratitude, Pete asks Zack to join them. However, it soon becomes obvious that Zack doesn't share the group's political views, and when he states that he thinks Hitler had the right idea, the argument turns into a fight, with Zack brandishing a knife. The trucker is accidentally killed in the scuffle, and rather than report the death to the police, his body is buried in the backyard vegetable garden. However, the event prompts much discussion among the housemates -- if Zack was a hateful bigot, isn't the world better off without him? And wouldn't killing other ignorant hatemongers improve society all the more? Before long, the group is having a weekly dinner party in which they invite a special guest -- including an anti-environmental activist (Jason Alexander), a right-wing religious leader (Charles Durning), a sexist who doesn't believe there's such a thing as rape (Mark Harmon), and a teenager campaigning against sex education in schools (Erin Bryn) -- and serve them some wine, which happens to be laced with arsenic. While the group's attempt at community improvement does wonders for their tomato plants, the recent disappearances eventually attract the attention of the local sheriff (Nora Dunn). The Last Supper was the first feature for director Stacy Title, who won an Academy Award for her short subject Down on the Waterfront; screenwriter Dan Rosen appears in a supporting role as a police deputy(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Ratatouille</title>
    <desc lang="en">A scrawny rat named Remy (voice of Patton Oswalt) finds his dreams of culinary superstardom stirring up sizable controversy in the kitchen of a fine French restaurant in director Brad Bird's madcap computer-animated comedy. It's hard being a rat with culinary aspirations, but Remy is convinced he has what it takes to break the stereotypes and follow in the footsteps of star chef Auguste Gusteau (voice of Brad Garrett). As fate would have it, Remy is currently situated in the sewers directly beneath Gusteau's elegant restaurant. Soon Remy teams up with a young chef with little talent named Linguini (voice of Lou Romano). Together they are able to create some fabulous dishes, but they live in fear that someone will discover their secret and object strenuously to a rat being in a kitchen. When Remy's passion for cooking turns the haughty world of French cuisine upside down, the rat who would be king of the kitchen learns important lessons about life, friends, and family while questioning whether he should pursue his culinary calling or simply go back underground and return to his life as a sewer rat(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Alpha and Omega</title>
    <desc lang="en">Two mismatched wolves embark on a cross-country quest to get back home and restore peace in their pack after being relocated thousands of miles away by well-meaning park rangers. Quick-witted Humphrey (voice of Justin Long) likes to frolic with friends and play video games with squirrels; disciplined Kate (voice of Hayden Panettiere) likes to call the shots and hunt caribou. Normally, an omega wolf like Humphrey would never stand a chance with an alpha wolf like Kate, but when they're both transported halfway across the country they must work together to get back to their natural habitat. And it won't be easy either, because the one thing Humphrey and Kate can agree on is that they don't have anything in common. Perhaps by working together toward a common goal, however, the two contentious traveling companions will finally realize that even lone wolves can use a helping paw every once in a while. Christina Ricci, Danny Glover, Dennis Hopper, and Larry Miller also supply voices for the Crest Animation production, helmed by Anthony Bell and Ben Gluck from a script by Chris Denk(n)</desc>
