Finally, Luke and Louise deliver a polished performance, which is let down by an over-cooked main course, before the winning couple is revealed.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Comedian Cedric the Entertainer serves as both producer and star of this comedy about a family who discovers just how much can go wrong en route to a family get-together. When Nate Johnson (Cedric the Entertainer) is invited to a big family reunion in Missouri, he sees it as an opportunity to reconnect with his estranged wife and growing children, as well as a chance to show up his wealthier know-it-all brother, Mack (Steve Harvey). Nate takes delivery on an expensive new SUV, persuades his recently separated wife, Dorothy (Vanessa L. Williams), to tag along, and packs up his three kids -- nubile teenager Nikki (Solange Knowles), under-age wannabe rapper D.J. (Bow Wow), and precocious seven-year-old Destiny (Gabby Soleil) -- for what he imagines will be a leisurely drive from Los Angeles to St. Louis. However, between his wary wife, arguing kids, angry police officers, bizarre hitchhikers, bad diner food, and an unfortunate run-in with a cement mixer, getting from point A to point B proves to be just short of a nightmare. Johnson Family Vacation was the first feature film for director Christopher Erskin, who previously distinguished himself directing music videos for the likes of Missy Elliot, TLC, and Boyz II Men(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Dizzy Detectives. Gorillas, both fake and (supposedly) real, play a big part in this amusing Three Stooges comedy two-reeler. The boys are policemen masquerading as night watchmen in an attempt to trap a burglar dressed in a gorilla suit. They catch a gorilla, all right, but the beast proves to be real. The denouement is appropriately violent; the ferocious simian blows up after ingesting nitroglycerin. John Tyrrell, probably Columbia Pictures' busiest character actor, earned a major spot in this two-reeler, playing the wanted burglar. The studio liked the plot enough to remake it twice: Fraidy Cat (1951) and Hook a Crook (1955), both starring Joe Besser, who in 1956, replaced Shemp Howard as the third Stooge(n)</desc>

In this sequel, Hentsridge portrays Eve, a government experiment concocted to gain an understanding of how to combat future aliens, while Michael Madsen and Marg Helgenberger repeat their roles from the earlier film. When astronaut Patrick Ross (Justin Lazard) returns from the first manned Mars expedition, he's infected with the same DNA that spawned Sil and Eve. Hailed as a hero, Ross is pressed into politics by his father (James Cromwell), a senator. Any woman who beds the sexually active Ross is immediately impregnated, with embryos quickly developing and killing the mother. Ross hides the offspring on a family estate, as LA cops begin to detect a pattern in the female deaths. At the lab where scientists are monitoring Eve, Dr. Laura Baker (Helgenberger) realizes that Eve has a telepathic link with Ross, and that these two hybrids hope to couple. Press Lennox (Madsen) and Colonel Burgess (George Dzundza) figure Eve can be used to lead them to Ross. Cleared as a murder suspect, Mars mission astronaut Dennis Gamble (Mykelti Williamson), joins Lennox and Baker and gets in on the action as everyone involved closes in on Ross.

    <sub-title lang="en">Brexit - How to Get a British Passport: Channel 4 Dispatches.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Datshiane Navanayagam investigates just how hard it can be to get a British passport and the real impact that the lack of one has on many people's lives. She reveals there are already 120,000 children and young people born or raised in the UK who think that they are British, but who will not automatically gain citizenship, and she also examines the huge costs involved in applying for citizenship and how the Home Office assesses claims, and asks whether Brexit will make the situation worse.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">For years, London's East End was denied a new bridge because of the need to guarantee passage of ships up and down the Thames. For years, the greatest engineers of the age hunted for a design that would keep both road and water traffic moving. As Rob Bell explains, the solution came from architect Horace Jones, whose revolutionary design, with its thousand-tonne opening sections, was powered by nothing more than water. Rob also explains the bridge was lucky to survive the Second World War, having been a target for German V-1 flying bombs.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Fido</title>
    <desc lang="en">In a 1950s-era alternate universe where domesticated zombies play a functional role in society by delivering the milk, carrying the mail, and even helping out with household chores, one boy is about to find out just how big of a personal responsibility "pet" ownership truly is. When the Earth passed through a cloud of space dust and the dead arose from their graves to devour the flesh of the living, it first seemed that all hope for humanity was lost. Society's rapid slide into chaos, however, was soon halted when scientists at a company called ZomCom created a special collar that turned the rampaging animated corpses docile. Now, thanks to ZomCom, everything is under control -- or is it? Timmy Robinson (K'Sun Ray) isn't quite convinced. Quiet and withdrawn, the skeptical young boy spends so much time locked away in his room that he's almost become invisible around the household. His mother Helen (Carrie-Anne Moss) has recently purchased a zombie to help keep things tidy around the house though, and when the creature attempts to engage the curious youngster in a game of catch, a friendship is forged between boy and zombie that finds the amiable gut-muncher nicknamed Fido (Billy Connolly) practically becoming a part of the family. Things take a turn for the worse however, when Fido's collar malfunctions and Timmy's neighbors begin dying in droves. When ZomCom's top zombie control specialist Mr. Bottoms (Henry Czerny) moves in across the street from Timmy, the increasingly complicated situation threatens to place a serious stumbling block in the path of human-zombie relations(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Chef Goes Nanners. Political correctness takes another round of satiric jabs from this pointedly irreverent episode of South Park. Chef intends to change the seemingly racist banner South Park claims as its flag. He gets support from young Wendy Testaburger, but her concentration is undermined by her attraction to the admittedly disgusting Cartman. After Kyle and Stan explain to Chef their wholesome reading of the seemingly racist flag, Chef stops his fight. "Chef Goes Nanners" first aired July 5, 2000, on Comedy Central(n)</desc>

The rock band Korn, who happen to be in town to perform a concert, helps Kenny, Kyle, Stan, and Eric stop the tormenting they have been getting from the fifth graders. They also uncover the mystery behind the ghost pirates. While the entire episode pays tribute to Scooby-Doo, Star Wars jokes are also to be found in "Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghosts Mystery," which first aired October 27, 1999, on Comedy Central. The band did their own vocal work on the episode(n)</desc>

Other highlights include Greenland sharks, which live under the arctic ice, whitetip reef sharks - arguably the masters of night-time hunting - and the great white, shown stalking fur seals off the coast of South Africa.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Naturalist David Attenborough documents the universal tale that unites humanity with every other animal on the planet - the journey through life, and the goal to continue the bloodline through offspring. This edition focuses on the first hurdle any animal will face, surviving infancy.

Meanwhile, in New Zealand, young fur seals have stumbled across a safe haven in which they can learn how to avoid predators, while deep in the Gobi Desert, the long-eared jerboa learns to use its impeccable hearing to catch insect pray. Plus, albatross chicks make their first flight, as threatening tiger sharks wait patiently for them to slip up and land in the sea.(n)</desc>

Ellie travels to Australia to meet three koalas called Tilly, Puddles and Danny, who were rescued from the roadside where their mother had been killed - Danny needs around-the-clock care and is building up his strength with night-time games of chase. She also meets a tiny wallaby called Neil, whose carer Stella is worried may die from stress if they can't find him a companion. Elsewhere, wildlife cameraman Max is in Costa Rica where he gets acquainted with Newbie, a five-month-old three-toed sloth who has suffered from pneumonia since she was rescued. He follows wildlife manager Sam at Kids Saving the Rainforest as she tries to teach the baby sloth to climb trees and learn to go back to the wild.(n)</desc>

The film initially portrays Sam Childers as being a far from nice man: a misogynistic biker whose life is steeped in crime, narcotics and violence, and who quickly returns to armed robbery almost as soon as he's released from jail. But while he was inside, his wife Lynn found Jesus, and, after Sam gets stabbed, she urges him to join her at church. Sam subsequently has his own Damascene moment and starts life afresh, founding his own (legitimate) construction company. Before long he has also built his own church. But it's only after a trip to Sudan, where he witnesses the devastation wrought by the marauding Lord's Resistance Army, that he truly becomes driven. Relocating to the African country, he sets up a faith-based centre to care for victims of the LRA's violence and rape. And also takes up arms to literally fight the good fight...

    <desc lang="en">In this documentary centered on legendary filmmaker John Ford's cinematic contributions to Allied morale during World War II, actor/musician Kris Kristofferson narrates as the How Green Was My Valley director turns his back on Tinseltown in order to fulfill his patriotic duty. By the time the United States became involved in World War II, John Ford was already a film legend, but when Uncle Sam came calling the veteran filmmaker eagerly packed his bags and set his sites on the frontlines. Though Ford did sustain battlefield injuries during the production of the Oscar-winning documentary The Battle of Midway, the remarkable film endeared him to patriotic American audiences across the country and his next wartime effort, 1943's December 7th, proceeded to earn the filmmaker yet another Oscar. In addition to featuring footage from these and other, lesser-known wartime films from Ford, this documentary also offers an intimate look at the complex filmmaker and explores his remarkable legacy through both archive footage and interviews with such notable directors as Oliver Stone and Peter Bogdanovich(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">An undercover CIA agent attempting to thwart the sale of a nuclear weapon is forced to do battle with a dangerous horde of murderous arms dealers in this explosive action entry directed by Hong Kong veteran Po-Chih Leong and starring American action icon Wesley Snipes. Sonni Griffith (Snipes) is en route to Poland to expose a notorious arms dealer when the dealer is tipped off to the agent's identity and Griffith subsequently ends up in a prison cell. Soon released by the CIA with a mission to escort beautiful Russian Nadia (Silvia Colloca) back to the United States, Griffith quickly learns that the very same arms dealer he sought to wipe out is willing to kill for a valuable secret known only to his strong-willed charge. It seems that Nadia is the only one who knows the location of the hidden 30 million dollars that would allow Griffith's nemesis to purchase a nuclear bomb. Now with nothing to lose and everything to fight for, Griffith and Nadia must take on the world's most deadly arms dealer in order to save millions of lives(n)</desc>

The six hopefuls begin by dishing up their Calling Card, a single plate of food that represents who they are, followed by the Invention Test, in which they rustle up a dish in one hour from a choice of two surprise sets of ingredients. After two cooks are sent home, things get serious, with the rest preparing dinner for three discerning guests - 2010 MasterChef winner Dhruv Baker, and Chris Gates and Hannah Miles, finalists from 2009 and 2007 respectively. It's then up to John and Gregg to decide which two will advance to Friday's quarter-final.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Death brings a contentious family together (though that doesn't mean they get along) in this comedy-drama from director Anna Chi. When elderly Mrs. Xiao (Lisa Lu) dies in her sleep at home, her housekeeper and close friend Viola (Talia Shire) contacts her four adult children in hopes they'll come home to help with the funeral. Unfortunately, Mrs. Xiao didn't have many friends besides Viola, her children all have issues with her, and given her zeal to assimilate into American culture, the siblings are more than puzzled that she insisted upon a traditional Chinese funeral lasting a full seven days. Alexander (Russell Wong), a successful doctor, is still coming to terms with his overly strict mother and philandering father, and is unexpectedly reunited with his ex-wife (Kelly Hu), who he lost through his own infidelity. Elizabeth (Julia Nickson), a writer, also crosses paths with her former spouse (Adrian Hough) while she mourns both her mother and her young son. Victoria (Francoise Yip) has never been able to forgive her mom after she rejected her for marrying an African-American. And MeiMei (Steph Song), an actress, is a lesbian who wants to have children with her significant other Deedee (Bai Ling); they've been having trouble finding a suitable sperm donor, though they think one of the monks at the funeral may be just what they're looking for.

Carlos and Elena are in love and living in the United States, but while they'd like to stay, they have a problem -- their visas are soon to expire, and they aren't sure when or if they'll be able to get green cards that will allow them permanent residence. Carlos and Elena are close friends with Mike White (McCaleb Burnett) and Betty Bristol (Ashley Wolfe), who were born and raised in the States. Like Carlos and Elena, Mike and Betty are planning to marry but haven't done so yet, and when they learn of their friends' dilemma, someone comes up with a solution -- Carlos will marry Betty, Mike will marry Elena, and once their respective green cards come through, both couples will divorce and everyone lives happily ever after. However, the plan doesn't go as smoothly as expected -- suspicious immigration agents are keeping a close watch on Carlos and Elena, so the newlyweds have to live with their respective spouses and act happily married in order to maintain the illusion of matrimony, which leads the four friends into a variety of romantic complications. Immigration Tango received its world premiere at the 2010 Boston International Film Festival(n)</desc>

(but better know by his mother Voletta - who co-produced the movie - as Christopher Wallace). Early on, the young Smalls shows interest in writing and performing rap with his friends, but he soon drifts into a life of drug dealing instead. Smalls' fortunes look to improve when a demo tape of his music is noticed by big time producer Sean Combs (who also co-produced the movie, and is played by Derek Luke), who signs the rapper to his Uptown Records label, on the understanding that Smalls will forsake his narcotics activities. Director Tillman Jr goes on to track the nascent recording star's trajectory from this promising start, through his constant philandering, his love/ hate relationship with West Coast rapper Tupac Shakur and on to the bitter, ultimately homicidal, rivalry between the East and West Coast rap scenes, which was to bring to an abrupt, permanent end to both men's careers(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Documentary shedding light on whether there is any truth to conspiracy theorists' suggestions that London and Washington had been aware the Japanese were planning to assault the American naval base at Pearl Harbour in 1941, but refused to act on the intelligence as part of a plot to bring the full might of America's military into the Second World War. In the wake of the attack, an investigation into how US forces failed to anticipate the assault concluded that Admiral Husband Kimmel, Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet, had been guilty of dereliction of duty, a charge that left his career in tatters. Making use of new research into a top-secret US military project, as well as thousands of freshly unearthed documents, letters and photographs, this film aims to answer - once and for all - whether the brutal attack that claimed nearly 2,500 lives could have been prevented.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This is the amazing true story of a lonely female African wild dog that has befriended a number of other predators and is helping to raise jackal pups in the Okavango Delta. Once there were plenty of wild dogs living on Mombo Island in the centre of the delta but competition from hyenas and lions decimated the dog packs. Today only one lonely female dog remains. Her name is Solo. Her two male companions disappeared three years ago, presumed killed by lions. What makes this wild dog exceptional is that she is friends with a number of hyenas and jackal families, taking them hunting and providing food for them. For the last two years Solo has helped the jackals raise their pups, regurgitating food for them as if they were her own. The pups accept Solo, as she feeds, grooms and protects them, even chasing away her old hyena friends that wander dangerously close. Living in a land of lions Solo benefits from her friendships as the jackals are forever alert to approaching danger. But when a pack of wild dogs suddenly appears Solo has to make a choice - to stay with her adopted family or join her own kind(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Home of the Year</title>
    <desc lang="en">Interior designer Hugh Wallace, architect Declan O'Donnell and award-winning interior designer Deirdre Whelan visit another three homes whose owners are competing for the title. This week, the judges examine a 19th-century two-storey thatched cottage owned by the boss of a glamping business in North Leitrim. Next up is a lakeside cabin in Co Westmeath that has been modernised into a country-style home that aims to reflect the beauty of its woodland location. Finally, the trio take a tour of a 1980s bungalow in Co Galway, remodelled into a dream family home that blends classic and contemporary features.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Crash</title>
    <desc lang="en">Paul Haggis won two Oscars for his major feature debut as director and co- writer. Set in Los Angeles over two days, it is a picaresque, episodic film with a cast of disparate characters whose lives coincide for one reason or another, from racist cop John Ryan who pulls over black TV director Cameron Thayer and his wife Christine, to the simple hassles that Iranian Farad encounters. Haggis shows a city where racism and its manifestations are easily encountered but where those at both the giving and receiving end are not simple ciphers but complex human beings whose intolerance is caused by both their personal and society's problems(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Akeelah and the Bee</title>
    <desc lang="en">A young girl learns to believe in herself and value her intelligence in this critically-acclaimed, family-friendly drama. Akeelah Anderson (Keke Palmer) is an 11-year-old being raised by her mother, Tanya (Angela Bassett), who was left on her own after the death of her husband. While Akeelah is a very bright girl, she's hardly a star student and seems afraid of acting like a bookworm around her friends and classmates. However, Akeelah's teacher sees genuine potential in her student and encourages her to enter the school's spelling bee, convinced Akeelah has the brains and the talent to win. Akeelah applies herself and emerges victorious in the local competition, but discovers the going gets tougher when she goes to a statewide bee, studying for the regionals under the aegis of strict English teacher Dr. Larabee (Laurence Fishburne), who consents to act as her coach A college professor who was a spelling-bee champ as a child, Larabee is a stubborn taskmaster who questions Akeelah's ability and commitment, but in time he develops a respect for his pupil and helps her prove her talent as she climbs the ladder to the National Spelling Bee. Meanwhile, Tanya feels intimidated when she finds the contests are dominated by children from wealthy families and privileged backgrounds, and argues that the competition may not be in Akeelah's best interest, believing instead that homework should be the one and only priority in Akeelah's life. It soon becomes apparent that if Akeelah has any intention of entering the national spelling bee championships in Washington, D.C., she will not do so with Tanya's permission or blessing. This marks the first onscreen reunion of Bassett and Fishburne since their Academy Award-nommed performances as Ike Turner and Tina Turner in Brian Gibson's 1993 biopic, What's Love Got to Do with It(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Paul Haggis won two Oscars for his major feature debut as director and co- writer. Set in Los Angeles over two days, it is a picaresque, episodic film with a cast of disparate characters whose lives coincide for one reason or another, from racist cop John Ryan who pulls over black TV director Cameron Thayer and his wife Christine, to the simple hassles that Iranian Farad encounters. Haggis shows a city where racism and its manifestations are easily encountered but where those at both the giving and receiving end are not simple ciphers but complex human beings whose intolerance is caused by both their personal and society's problems(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Akeelah and the Bee</title>
    <desc lang="en">A young girl learns to believe in herself and value her intelligence in this critically-acclaimed, family-friendly drama. Akeelah Anderson (Keke Palmer) is an 11-year-old being raised by her mother, Tanya (Angela Bassett), who was left on her own after the death of her husband. While Akeelah is a very bright girl, she's hardly a star student and seems afraid of acting like a bookworm around her friends and classmates. However, Akeelah's teacher sees genuine potential in her student and encourages her to enter the school's spelling bee, convinced Akeelah has the brains and the talent to win. Akeelah applies herself and emerges victorious in the local competition, but discovers the going gets tougher when she goes to a statewide bee, studying for the regionals under the aegis of strict English teacher Dr. Larabee (Laurence Fishburne), who consents to act as her coach A college professor who was a spelling-bee champ as a child, Larabee is a stubborn taskmaster who questions Akeelah's ability and commitment, but in time he develops a respect for his pupil and helps her prove her talent as she climbs the ladder to the National Spelling Bee. Meanwhile, Tanya feels intimidated when she finds the contests are dominated by children from wealthy families and privileged backgrounds, and argues that the competition may not be in Akeelah's best interest, believing instead that homework should be the one and only priority in Akeelah's life. It soon becomes apparent that if Akeelah has any intention of entering the national spelling bee championships in Washington, D.C., she will not do so with Tanya's permission or blessing. This marks the first onscreen reunion of Bassett and Fishburne since their Academy Award-nommed performances as Ike Turner and Tina Turner in Brian Gibson's 1993 biopic, What's Love Got to Do with It(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Day</title>
    <desc lang="en">A small band of friends make an uneasy alliance with a mysterious lone wolf in this blend of horror and adventure. An unnamed catastrophe has turned the Earth into a wasteland, and as packs of feral cannibals wander the countryside, a dwindling number of survivors struggle to stay alive. Rick (Dominic Monaghan), Adam (Shawn Ashmore), Henson (Cory Hardrict), and Shannon (Shannyn Sossamon) have been journeying together for months and are the last living members of a much larger group. Mary (Ashley Bell) is a solitary woman who crossed paths with the survivors and is now traveling with them. She isn't interested in discussing her past or becoming friends, but the others learn she's a powerful ally in a fight. The travelers take shelter in a house, but are soon surrounded by cannibals; they quickly realize just how strong a warrior Mary can be, while also discovering the terrible truth that led her to wander alone. The Day was directed by Douglas Aarniokoski, who has accumulated extensive credits as an assistant director and helming second-unit material on major films(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Cinderella Man</title>
    <desc lang="en">The true story of an athlete who achieved his greatest success against the most daunting odds of his life is brought to the screen in this historical drama. In the 1920s, James Braddock (Russell Crowe) from Bergen, NJ, was a promising contender in professional boxing; he had strength, spirit, and tenacity, but the combination of a serious hand injury and a 1929 defeat in a bout with light heavyweight champ Tommy Loughran sent his career into a serious tailspin. As Braddock's career in the ring dried up, the Great Depression put a stake through the heart of America's economy, and Braddock found himself working at the New York docks for pitiful wages as he tried to support his wife, Mae (Renée Zellweger), and three children. Desperate for money, Braddock turned to his former trainer and manager Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti), who was unexpectedly able to scare up a bout for him, battling John Griffin at Madison Square Garden. While conventional wisdom had it that Braddock was too old, out of shape, and out of practice to have any chance of winning, he defeated Griffin, and continued beating his opponents with a powerful left hook that had been intensified by years of punishing dock work. In a nation desperate for good news, Braddock's surprising comeback became a tonic to struggling workers and unemployed people, and all eyes were on Braddock when in 1935 he took on powerful heavyweight champion Max Baer (Craig Bierko) in what was both literally and figuratively the fight of his life(n)</desc>

It's that time of the year, and as the snow falls outside and families gather around the dinner table, Angela vows to close one last deal before the holiday. Now late for her family gathering, Angela rushes down to the garage in hopes of racing home and catching dinner before it gets cold. When her car refuses to start, her phone fails to get a signal, and everyone else has already left, it begins to appear as if Angela's luck may have finally run out. Thankfully, a friendly security guard appears and offers to lend a helping hand. During the course of discussion, the security guard flirtatiously invites Angela to share the Christmas dinner he has prepared in the parking office -- an offer that the high-powered corporate climber laughingly dismisses. The next thing Angela knows, she wakes up tied to a chair in the cold security office located on level P2. It appears as if the security guard's invitation wasn't optional, and that Christmas dinner was the last thing on his mind. Upon realizing just how serious her situation truly is, Angela struggles to escape her subterranean prison and make it out so that she might live to see another Christmas morning(n)</desc>

This tests the bond linking the three men, and leads to a violent denouement in the ancient city's cobbled streets(n)</desc>

However, a bogus neighborhood Santa Claus (Rickey Smiley) decides to help Craig and Day-Day share the wealth by robbing their apartment, and when he rips off their stereo, he also makes off with their rent money, which was hidden in the speaker cabinets. Desperate to make rent and have some money for Christmas presents, Craig and Day-Day land jobs at a local strip mall, where their fathers, Mr. Jones (John Witherspoon) and Uncle Elroy (Don "D.C."

And it won't be easy either, because the one thing Humphrey and Kate can agree on is that they don't have anything in common. Perhaps by working together toward a common goal, however, the two contentious traveling companions will finally realize that even lone wolves can use a helping paw every once in a while.

Rev. Stephen Kumalo (James Earl Jones) is a minister from a poverty-stricken farming community who travels to Johannesburg for the first time in search of his son Absalom (Eric Miyeni), who moved to the city some time back and has gone missing. Kumalo regards the big city as a den of iniquity, and his low expectations are not betrayed; he is robbed and beaten shortly after he arrives, and when he visits his brother John (Charles S. Dutton), he discovers that Absalom has become a petty thief with a pregnant girlfriend, his sister Gertrude (Dambisa Kente) is a prostitute, and John has renounced his faith in God and advocates the violent overthrow of South Africa's white leadership. James Jarvis (Richard Harris) -- a wealthy white landowner from the same part of the country as Kumalo -- has also arrived in Johannesburg, also with sad personal business to attend to; his son, a well-liked activist for the rights of the city's black majority population, was killed during a robbery(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Zombieland</title>
    <desc lang="en">Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin star in Ruben Fleischer's very silly and gratuitously gory comedy, an everyday tale of strangers thrown together by the need to find sanctuary from flesh-eating hordes. The hordes in question were, until recently, human US citizens, but a global pandemic has transmogrified them into the shuffling, ravenous undead. Each of our heroic quartet is known only by the name of the town to which they're heading. Columbus, the movie's narrator, is a detail-obsessed introvert who has developed a seemingly endless checklist to avoid becoming a meal; Tallahassee is Columbus's polar opposite - rough and impetuous, he dispatches the undead with a gung-ho glee. After a tricky start, the duo team up and then let sisters Wichita and Little Rock join them. Their journey across the states takes in a Californian theme park and a visit to the home of a Hollywood star, but mainly it's an excuse for the four leads to off as many zombies as inventively, amusingly and bloodily as possible..(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Pilot Episode. The pilot episode of Friends has all of the main characters meeting at their favorite coffee shop, Central Perk. Spoiled trust fund girl Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) has left her fiancé at the alter; showing up at the cafe in her wedding dress, she asks old high-school buddy Monica (Courteney Cox) if she can stay with her. Monica, meanwhile, goes on the first of many bizarre and failed dates that she will endure throughout the series. Ross (David Schwimmer) appears perennially depressed about his ex-wife, who left him for another woman. They all make ironic fun of Spanish soap operas and Ross admits to his crush on Rachel -- setting into motion the major emotional pull of the first two seasons. A highlight is Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) singing the first of many of what become her trademark silly songs: "Love is sweet as summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art; but your love, oh your love -- your love is like a giant pigeon crapping on my heart."
