    <title lang="en">Insomnia</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Christopher Nolan follows up his breakthrough sophomore film Memento with this remake of a stylish Norwegian thriller. Al Pacino stars as Detective Will Dormer, a Los Angeles Police Department legend who temporarily escapes an internal affairs investigation that may ruin his career by traveling to Nightmute, AK, the remote site of a murder that has the local authorities flummoxed. Along with his partner, Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan), and the small town's wide-eyed rookie investigator, Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank), the exhausted Dormer probes the brutal slaying of a teenage girl who was rumored to have a secret lover. A clever ruse quickly lures the killer into a police trap, but the suspect escapes and a tragic accident at the scene leaves Dormer at the mercy of the murderer, a pulp crime novelist named Walter Finch (Robin Williams). As Finch plays a dangerous game of extortion with Dormer, the detective's mental health deteriorates rapidly from guilt over his complicity in a crime and sleep deprivation compounded by the lack of darkness in the land of the midnight sun. Meanwhile, the bright and dogged Ellie continues putting the pieces of a complex puzzle together despite Dormer's skillful attempts to lead the investigation toward the right suspect, but away from his own malfeasance. Insomnia co-stars Paul Dooley, Nicky Katt, Maura Tierney, and Jonathan Jackson(n)</desc>

The raid was so costly it threatened to undermine the UK's economic stability and saw the robbers take hostages, who were manipulated into helping them gain access to the vaults. The subsequent police investigation initially began as a hunt for a highly organised squad of professional robbers, but a series of catastrophic mistakes on the part of the culprits made it clear they were low-level criminals seeking riches.(n)</desc>

Ten-year-old Maya (Abigail Breslin) is heartbroken to see her parents splitting up, but she's determined to find out precisely how it was that mom and dad came together in the first place. When Maya starts questioning her father Will (Ryan Reynolds) about his life before marriage, dad's memories soon drift back to the time when, as a naïve Wisconsin native and aspiring politician hoping to work on the presidential election, he first arrived in New York City. As Will gradually became savvy to the ways of the big city, he gradually developed romantic relationships with three very different women: Emily (Elizabeth Banks) was the girl-next-door that he could always depend on, apolitical April (Isla Fisher) was the best friend and confidante who was always there to listen, and free-spirited journalist Summer (Rachel Weisz) was both beautiful and ambitious. In order to prevent his perceptive little girl from predicting the outcome before his story is told, Will carefully changes the names of his three romantic interests, creating a hopelessly romantic puzzle that highlights both the joys and hardships of true love(n)</desc>

Dr. Will Jennings (Stuart Townsend) and his wife, Karen (Charlize Theron), find their world has been turned upside down when they're taken hostage and held in different cities while their young daughter is kidnapped by the same band of ruthless criminals. Joe Hickey (Kevin Bacon) has hatched a seemingly foolproof plan with his wife, Cheryl (Courtney Love), and cousin, Marvin (Pruitt Taylor Vince): while Dr. Jennings and Mrs. Jennings are under guard and unable to contact the police, Hickey will demand a massive ransom for the return of their daughter. If the payment is not arranged in 24 hours, the girl will be killed. Will and Karen realize it's imperative that they find their daughter as soon as possible, as she suffers from a medical condition that could claim her life if she doesn't receive her medication within a day, but as Karen plots a way to get away from Joe and rescue her little girl, she discovers money isn't the only reason Joe has chosen the Jenningses as his victims. Trapped was based on the novel 24 Hours by Greg Iles; 24 Hours was also announced as the film's title before it was changed to avoid being confused with the popular television series 24(n)</desc>

Ten-year-old Maya (Abigail Breslin) is heartbroken to see her parents splitting up, but she's determined to find out precisely how it was that mom and dad came together in the first place. When Maya starts questioning her father Will (Ryan Reynolds) about his life before marriage, dad's memories soon drift back to the time when, as a naïve Wisconsin native and aspiring politician hoping to work on the presidential election, he first arrived in New York City. As Will gradually became savvy to the ways of the big city, he gradually developed romantic relationships with three very different women: Emily (Elizabeth Banks) was the girl-next-door that he could always depend on, apolitical April (Isla Fisher) was the best friend and confidante who was always there to listen, and free-spirited journalist Summer (Rachel Weisz) was both beautiful and ambitious. In order to prevent his perceptive little girl from predicting the outcome before his story is told, Will carefully changes the names of his three romantic interests, creating a hopelessly romantic puzzle that highlights both the joys and hardships of true love(n)</desc>

Joe Hickey (Kevin Bacon) has hatched a seemingly foolproof plan with his wife, Cheryl (Courtney Love), and cousin, Marvin (Pruitt Taylor Vince): while Dr. Jennings and Mrs. Jennings are under guard and unable to contact the police, Hickey will demand a massive ransom for the return of their daughter. If the payment is not arranged in 24 hours, the girl will be killed. Will and Karen realize it's imperative that they find their daughter as soon as possible, as she suffers from a medical condition that could claim her life if she doesn't receive her medication within a day, but as Karen plots a way to get away from Joe and rescue her little girl, she discovers money isn't the only reason Joe has chosen the Jenningses as his victims. Trapped was based on the novel 24 Hours by Greg Iles; 24 Hours was also announced as the film's title before it was changed to avoid being confused with the popular television series 24(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Free to Murder Again. The Texas penal system wakes up from a nightmare in the A&amp;E program American Justice: Free to Murder Again. The subject of the documentary is serial killer Kenneth McDuff, the biggest mistake the parole board ever made. McDuff was first sentenced to death in 1968 for killing three teenagers. Seemingly, his incarceration meant the end of his murder spree. But due to the overcrowding of Texas jails, McDuff was eventually released after serving only 21 years. Soon, the criminal was back on the streets harassing children and adults alike. In 1991, McDuff abducted and killed a young woman only to repeat the pattern two years later with a pregnant mother of two. When he was captured and resentenced to death, his murderous trail was reported to include a handful of others. McDuff's situation alerted the government to the failures of the parole boards. His case eventually resulted in a slew of new prison constructions and tough law reforms(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Killer Climate.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Tony Robinson investigates the ruins of three civilisations over the past 2,000 years to ask what made them more vulnerable to climate catastrophe than the ones that survived. In the jungles of Central America, he learns about the effect of a decades-long drought on the Mayans, while Dr Joy Singarayer visits Greenland to discover how a mini ice age in the 13th century wiped out the Vikings. In the deserts of America's southwest, Dr Jago Cooper explores the crisis that made the inhabitants of cliff cities homeless.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Tony Robinson examines societies that have flourished as a result of climate change. In Peru, the Hauri people responded to a savage drought by developing advanced water management techniques, while in Europe, a mini ice age triggered the Black Death, which resulted in a period of unprecedented progression. The Industrial Revolution was hastened by the benefits of a stable weather pattern, but this appears to be ending, bringing a new threat to mankind.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Hosted--or rather, refereed--by boxing expert Max Kellerman, this lively cable-TV discussion show featured four sports columnists, each from a different part of the USA, discussing recent pro-athletic developments in a sort of electronic summit meeting. Kellerman determined how much time each of the columnists would be permitted to express his or her opinions--and he was harsh indeed, frequently limiting the discourse to ten seconds or less. At the end of the show, Kellerman would award points for the most cogent opinions and arguments, and also subtract points from contributors whom he determined had not effectively expressed themselves. The inagural episode of ESPN's Around the Horn was seen on September 30, 2002(n)</desc>

He then moves on to Renaissance Italy, where Galileo Galilei unlocked the potential of telescopes in locating Earth's true place within the cosmos, before assessing the implications of Danish astronomer Ole Roemer's groundbreaking finding - that light moves at a finite speed.(n)</desc>

Seen on the NBC-owned stations in the larger markets, Whacked Out Sports was initially broadcast on September 7, 2006(n)</desc>

As Molly and Victoria search for Mike, Molly has a talk with Victoria about how she needs to start cleaning up her act and get real about her life (opening the door to Victoria growing up a little.) Also, Carl has a new apartment but he's lonely. He invites over Samuel and does everything he can to prevent Samuel from leaving(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The second lot of five hopefuls try their hand at professional service, preparing lunch at the Grain Store, a London restaurant overseen by classically trained chef Bruno Loubet. With paying customers to satisfy, they soon feel the weight of responsibility - who will rise to the challenge? The hopefuls then have a chance to show what they have learnt by rustling up a dish in an invention test, choosing from an array of seasonal produce - but in an unexpected twist, they also present their food to renowned chef Marcus Wareing. He then helps John Torode and Gregg Wallace evaluate the five amateurs before they decide which one has gone far enough in the competition.(n)</desc>

However, this precarious balance is upset when a headstrong young man, Lucius Hunt, decides to find out what lies outside Covington(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Marley &amp; Me</title>
    <desc lang="en">The Devil Wears Prada director David Frankel's light comedy/ drama - based on a best-selling autobiography - stars Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston as a pair of married journalists who welcome a truly unruly dog into their lives. Relocating to Florida, newlyweds John and Jenny Grogan end up working for rival newspapers, and it's soon obvious that Jenny has landed the more high-profile job. But when she starts to become broody, one of John's colleagues suggests they see how they cope with a puppy before trying for a baby. John duly picks a cute yellow Labrador Retriever as a gift for his spouse. It's quickly clear their acquisition is something of a double-edged sword: he's an untrainably anarchic source of destruction; but he also gives John the material for a wry newspaper column, which greatly increases his standing (and the paper's readership). The film follows the trajectory of the Grogans' marriage, through good times and bad, and the stuff of everyday life, with the dog providing comic relief and the leads turning in convincing, heart-warming performances(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Matchstick Men</title>
    <desc lang="en">Ridley Scott directs the crime comedy Matchstick Men, based on the novel of the same name by Eric Garcia. Neurotic con man Roy (Nicolas Cage) suffers from several emotional problems, including obsessive-compulsive disorder. He and his partner Frank (Sam Rockwell) swindle people out of money by posing as money collectors who promise things like tax refunds, package vacations, and other fabulous prizes (which they never get). Frank wants to pull a really big job, but Roy is too consumed with fear and panic attacks to join him. Only cigarettes and his trusty illegal prescription drugs seem to keep him going. When Roy finds himself in desperate need of more pills, he is forced to see legitimate psychotherapist Dr. Klein (Bruce Altman). Roy ends up talking about his emotional damage from a troubled marriage and divorce, which results in the discovery of a child whom he has never met. Dr. Klein suggests that he spend a weekend with the kid, so in walks teenaged Angela (played by twentysomething Alison Lohman). Reluctant to develop his role as a father, Roy also gets heavily involved in Frank's ambitious swindle(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Marley &amp; Me</title>
    <desc lang="en">The Devil Wears Prada director David Frankel's light comedy/ drama - based on a best-selling autobiography - stars Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston as a pair of married journalists who welcome a truly unruly dog into their lives. Relocating to Florida, newlyweds John and Jenny Grogan end up working for rival newspapers, and it's soon obvious that Jenny has landed the more high-profile job. But when she starts to become broody, one of John's colleagues suggests they see how they cope with a puppy before trying for a baby. John duly picks a cute yellow Labrador Retriever as a gift for his spouse. It's quickly clear their acquisition is something of a double-edged sword: he's an untrainably anarchic source of destruction; but he also gives John the material for a wry newspaper column, which greatly increases his standing (and the paper's readership). The film follows the trajectory of the Grogans' marriage, through good times and bad, and the stuff of everyday life, with the dog providing comic relief and the leads turning in convincing, heart-warming performances(n)</desc>

Neurotic con man Roy (Nicolas Cage) suffers from several emotional problems, including obsessive-compulsive disorder. He and his partner Frank (Sam Rockwell) swindle people out of money by posing as money collectors who promise things like tax refunds, package vacations, and other fabulous prizes (which they never get). Frank wants to pull a really big job, but Roy is too consumed with fear and panic attacks to join him. Only cigarettes and his trusty illegal prescription drugs seem to keep him going. When Roy finds himself in desperate need of more pills, he is forced to see legitimate psychotherapist Dr. Klein (Bruce Altman). Roy ends up talking about his emotional damage from a troubled marriage and divorce, which results in the discovery of a child whom he has never met. Dr. Klein suggests that he spend a weekend with the kid, so in walks teenaged Angela (played by twentysomething Alison Lohman). Reluctant to develop his role as a father, Roy also gets heavily involved in Frank's ambitious swindle(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Jeffrey Blitz's seriocomedy Rocket Science proves that many a handicap can be overcome, no matter how daunting the obstacle at hand may initially seem. Newcomer Reece Thompson plays Hal Hefner, a 15-year-old high-school student with a minor yet socially alienating (and painful) disability: he stutters uncontrollably. Determined to work through the problem, Hal opts for an extreme route -- he joins the school debating team, which sends him on a headfirst plunge into breakneck speech competitions -- and offers a much-needed boost toward correcting the problem. Blitz, like his onscreen alter ego, struggled with a stammer as a young man -- a disability he eventually surmounted -- which imparted him with a lifelong interest in speech and storytelling(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">If you could talk to the child that you used to be, what advice would you give him? That question forms the basis of this comic fantasy. Forty-year-old Russ Duritz (Bruce Willis) is a wealthy and powerful "image consultant" who has made a career out of telling people how to present themselves. But while he's a success in business, he's a failure in life; he's vain, mean-spirited, and hasn't been able to hold onto a marriage (or even a pet dog). One day, Russ is startled to meet Rusty (Spencer Breslin), a stocky kid whom he soon realizes is himself at the age of eight, having passed through a wrinkle in time. Young Rusty doesn't seem much happier than the grown-up Russ, so the older man takes his younger self under his wing and tries to teach him how to avoid the mistakes he's made, while Rusty encourages Russ to be a more caring human being. Along the way, Russ and Rusty become friends, and realize how much they can learn from each other. Disney's The Kid also stars Jean Smart as one of Russ' clients, Lily Tomlin as his assistant, and Daniel Von Bargen as his father(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Number 23</title>
    <desc lang="en">Jim Carrey and Virginia Madsen star in this dark psychological thriller from director Joel Schumacher. Walter Sparrow is leading a contented life until his wife Agatha innocently gives him a battered old paperback as a gift. As he reads, Sparrow is astonished by the parallels between his life and that of the novel's protagonist, Fingerling. But as the plot progresses it grows darker, featuring themes of transgressive sex, suicide and murder. It also hinges around Fingerling's obsession with the number 23 - a prime number that seems to pop up everywhere in the universe once you start to notice it. It's not long before 23 takes a similar hold on Sparrow. And, when he begins unjustly to view Agatha in the same distrustful light that Fingerling views his own spouse Fabrizia, it seems as if Sparrow has locked on to the same tragic trajectory as the story's lead character. Or can he find a way to wrench himself from the novel's grip?(n)</desc>

While Cross is dedicated to his work, he's just as committed to his home life, and is excited to learn he and his wife Maria (Carmen Ejogo) will be welcoming a third child. When a wealthy and well-connected woman is found dead and partially dismembered in her mansion, police chief Richard Brookwell (John C.

Clues point to French financier Leon Mercier (Jean Reno) as the killer's ultimate victim, but Cross and his team suspect Mercier has a secret he isn't willing to share, and the case becomes a personal obsession for Cross when the maniac first kills Monica and then Maria. Also starring Giancarlo Esposito and Cicely Tyson, Alex Cross marked Tyler Perry's debut as an action hero, playing the protagonist of James Patterson's series of best-selling crime novels; Cross was previously played on screen by Morgan Freeman in the films Kiss The Girls and Along Came A Spider(n)</desc>

The Food Standards Agency requires that ice-cream needs to contain milk protein and any kind of fat - vegetable being the one most commonly used. Martin Dickie and James Watt head to Brighton beach with an old-fashioned bicycle adorned with banners saying `Ice Vegetable Oil'. What will the public make of this product?.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Documentary revisiting the pride of African lions featured in Africa's Giant Killers: Natural World, which detailed a clash between drought-weakened elephants and hungry big cats in the northern stretches of the Kalahari Desert in Botswana. This follow-up rejoins the pride at the start of the rainy season, when the departure of the elephants brings a whole host of new problems for the lions. The males begin to turn against each other, and one inexperienced lioness places her cubs in mortal danger as a rival group challenges the area's resident lions. Wild fires caused by lightning devastate the landscape, and as the dust begins to settle, the pride must once again face off with the elephants or risk starvation. Narrated by Imogen Stubbs.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Broadcaster John Creedon retraces the final hours of Michael Collins, chairman of the fledgling Republic's provisional government, following the route his convoy took to reach West Cork on August 22, 1922 - the day of his assassination. The programme tells how Collins and his companions were lured into an ambush, resulting in a short gun battle in which the charismatic political leader was fatally shot in the head. Aiming to reconstruct the events of that fateful day, the presenter makes use of the same armoured car from the convoy, as well as testimonies from historians and Collins' own grand-niece.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Final Cut</title>
    <desc lang="en">Omar Naim's science-fiction thriller is set in a world where Zoe memory implants capture every memory. Retrieved after the subject's death, the implant is sent to a 'Cutter' for editing into a two-hour video for the bereaved. Alan Harkman is one of the best in the business and is hired by Jennifer Bannister to edit the memory of her husband, who was CEO of the company that developed Zoe. He also abused children, including their daughter, areas Harkman erases until he sees a face from his own past that sends him on his own quest. There is also a subplot with a rebel Cutter, Fletcher, who belongs to a group that believes the implants inhibit natural human expression, and wants Bannister's implant for their own reasons. This intelligent film was released in the same year as the similarly themed Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and The Manchurian Candidate but received a surprisingly limited release in Britain; this is a rare chance to enjoy it(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Crash</title>
    <desc lang="en">Issues of race and gender cause a group of strangers in Los Angeles to physically and emotionally collide in this drama from director and screenwriter Paul Haggis. Graham (Don Cheadle) is a police detective whose brother is a street criminal, and it hurts him to know his mother cares more about his ne'er-do-well brother than him. Graham's partner is Ria (Jennifer Esposito), who is also his girlfriend, though she has begun to bristle at his emotional distance, as well as his occasional insensitivity over the fact he's African-American and she's Hispanic. Rick (Brendan Fraser) is an L.A. district attorney whose wife, Jean (Sandra Bullock), makes little secret of her fear and hatred of people unlike herself. Jean's worst imaginings about people of color are confirmed when her SUV is carjacked by two African-American men -- Anthony (Chris Bridges, aka Ludacris), who dislikes white people as much as Jean hates blacks, and Peter (Larenz Tate), who is more open minded. Cameron (Terrence Howard) is a well-to-do African-American television producer with a beautiful wife, Christine (Thandie Newton). While coming home from a party, Cameron and Christine are pulled over by Officer Ryan (Matt Dillon), who subjects them to a humiliating interrogation (and her to an inappropriate search) while his new partner, Officer Hansen (Ryan Phillippe), looks on. Daniel (Michael Pena) is a hard-working locksmith and dedicated father who discovers that his looks don't lead many of his customers to trust him. And Farhad (Shaun Toub) is a Middle Eastern shopkeeper who is so constantly threatened in the wake of the 9/11 attacks that he decided he needs a gun to defend his family. Crash was the first directorial project for award-winning television and film writer Haggis(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Final Cut</title>
    <desc lang="en">Omar Naim's science-fiction thriller is set in a world where Zoe memory implants capture every memory. Retrieved after the subject's death, the implant is sent to a 'Cutter' for editing into a two-hour video for the bereaved. Alan Harkman is one of the best in the business and is hired by Jennifer Bannister to edit the memory of her husband, who was CEO of the company that developed Zoe. He also abused children, including their daughter, areas Harkman erases until he sees a face from his own past that sends him on his own quest. There is also a subplot with a rebel Cutter, Fletcher, who belongs to a group that believes the implants inhibit natural human expression, and wants Bannister's implant for their own reasons. This intelligent film was released in the same year as the similarly themed Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and The Manchurian Candidate but received a surprisingly limited release in Britain; this is a rare chance to enjoy it(n)</desc>

Since they are certified to dive in open waters, the couple breaks off from the group to go exploring. The Reef Explorer accidentally leaves without a proper head count, leaving them stranded in shark-infested waters. Kentis and producer wife Laura Lau did all the filming themselves in the actual ocean without extraneous special effects, while the actors wore special steel-mesh under their wetsuits in the scenes where actual sharks were involved. Open Water was shown at the Sundance Film Festival in 2004 as part of the American Spectrum competition(n)</desc>

Nick Halsey (Ferrell) was once a successful salesman with a happy marriage, but years of drinking are finally catching up with him, as he's fired from his job and his wife has decided she's had enough.

As Nick makes believe he isn't homeless in between beers, he strikes up a friendship with a kid from the neighborhood (Christopher Jordan Wallace), tries to reconnect with a girl he loved in high school (Laura Dern), and bonds with his neighbor Samantha (Rebecca Hall), who is pregnant and struggling to get by while her husband is away on business.

Nick Halsey (Ferrell) was once a successful salesman with a happy marriage, but years of drinking are finally catching up with him, as he's fired from his job and his wife has decided she's had enough. Nick's wife has kicked him out of the house and moved all his possessions onto their front lawn; hoping retain a bit of dignity and maybe raise some cash as he plots his next move, Nick puts a yard sale sign on his stuff and tries to convince the neighbors (and the cops) that he's simply selling some junk he doesn't need anymore. As Nick makes believe he isn't homeless in between beers, he strikes up a friendship with a kid from the neighborhood (Christopher Jordan Wallace), tries to reconnect with a girl he loved in high school (Laura Dern), and bonds with his neighbor Samantha (Rebecca Hall), who is pregnant and struggling to get by while her husband is away on business. Based on a short story by Raymond Carver, Everything Must Go was the first feature film from director and screenwriter Dan Rush(n)</desc>

Subsequently drowning in a sea of debt due to his student loans and his mother's medical bills, the disillusioned graduate hits a breaking point as the bank prepares to foreclose on his family home, and devises a plan to earn some quick cash while giving the rich a lesson in humility.

Joe Kingman (Johnson) was a star quarterback destined for greatness; not only is the Boston-based team he plays for well on their way to the championships, but he's got all the money and fame that a man could want out of life. A perpetual bachelor whose one brief marriage ended many moons ago, Kingman is stunned to learn that a long-forgotten youthful fling had more permanent consequences than he ever anticipated. Now, just as his career is set to blow up bigger than ever, this perpetual bachelor learns that he has a seven-year-old daughter named Peyton (Madison Pettis). So how does a lifelong jock who's used to partying all night and dropping 20-yard bombs all day adjust to a life of ballet classes, Barbie dolls, and afternoon play dates? Whatever road he chooses to take, it certainly won't be easy, especially since his ruthless, goal-oriented agent, Stella (Kyra Sedgwick), would rather see her client scoring touchdowns than cementing familial bonds(n)</desc>

Joe Kingman (Johnson) was a star quarterback destined for greatness; not only is the Boston-based team he plays for well on their way to the championships, but he's got all the money and fame that a man could want out of life. A perpetual bachelor whose one brief marriage ended many moons ago, Kingman is stunned to learn that a long-forgotten youthful fling had more permanent consequences than he ever anticipated. Now, just as his career is set to blow up bigger than ever, this perpetual bachelor learns that he has a seven-year-old daughter named Peyton (Madison Pettis). So how does a lifelong jock who's used to partying all night and dropping 20-yard bombs all day adjust to a life of ballet classes, Barbie dolls, and afternoon play dates? Whatever road he chooses to take, it certainly won't be easy, especially since his ruthless, goal-oriented agent, Stella (Kyra Sedgwick), would rather see her client scoring touchdowns than cementing familial bonds(n)</desc>

A bumbling thief named Sing (Stephen Chow) desires to be the toughest member of the dreaded gangster hit squad known as The Axe Gang, but to completely join the gang he has to commit murder. When Sing attempts to rob a crowded run-down apartment complex known as Pig Sty Alley, the locals begin to defend themselves with some high-flying kung fu skills, and a tiny war erupts between the local masters and the axe-wielding gang. After the gang busts the ancient kung fu king known as The Beast (Leung Siu Lung) out of jail, tensions reach a boiling point as Pig Sty Alley's landlady (Yuen Qiu) leads an all-out attack against the gang and Sing discovers his true heroic fate. Kung Fu Hustle, which set box-office records across Asia during its December 2004 release, also stars Yuen Wah and Xing Yu, and features fight choreography by legendary masters of martial arts cinema Yuen Woo Ping and Sammo Hung(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A mischievous magician gains the wisdom to become a powerful ruler after being swept away to a land of magic and mystery as director Sam Raimi and screenwriters Mitchell Kapner and David Lindsay-Abaire (Rabbit Hole) explore the genesis of author L. Frank Baum's enduring tales of Oz. Shady illusionist Oscar Diggs (James Franco) enchants curious audiences at a Kansas circus. A self-professed con man, he's a fast-talking performer who aspires to follow in the footsteps of inventors like Thomas Edison. Oscar is being chased across the circus grounds by the rampaging Strongman when a tornado blows in and everyone runs for cover. Seeing a hot-air balloon as his only chance for escape, the illusionist jumps in and cuts himself free. Magically transported to the wondrous world of Oz, he soon encounters Theodora (Mila Kunis), a temperamental witch who surmises that he is the wizard named after their land (Oscar's nickname is Oz), foretold to fall from the sky, defeat a nasty witch, and ascend to the throne. Theodora takes Oscar to the Emerald City to meet her sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz), a powerful witch who reveals that he cannot become the rightful ruler of Oz until he's accomplished his mission. Later, as Oscar and his new flying-monkey companion Finley (voice of Zach Braff) prepare to face their fearsome enemy, they're joined by the fragile but fearless China Girl (voice of Joey King) and benevolent witch Glinda the Good (Michelle Williams), who help them prepare for the arduous battle ahead. Together with the brave people of Oz, Oscar draws up a plan to rid the land of evil once and for all, and become the great and powerful king who will rule from his throne in the Emerald City(n)</desc>
