In Costa Rica, he meets, cooks and eats with five generations of the same family, including 106-year-old Jose, while on the Greek island of Ikaria 84-year-old goat farmer Nikos gives him clues to the secrets of the locals' long lives.

    <desc lang="en">The architect heads off to Italy, where it seems the residents have also been bitten by the `small buildings are beautiful' bug. The most spectacular place he visits is so high up in the mountains that it's only accessible by helicopter, but this difficulty is more than made up for by the views seen from it. Back in Britain, George meets a man turning a wrecked private jet into a crash pad and a Gypsy tattoo artist with big plans for an old railway carriage. George also challenges his pal, craftsman Will Hardie, to create a woodland retreat for less than the price of a family holiday.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The air ambulance is dispatched to collect Frances, an 80-year-old woman who fell three metres into her empty swimming pool while gardening, and has sustained a head wound that could have resulted in a life-altering bleed on the brain. Ruth, aged 86, arrives at St George's A&amp;E with her heart beating three times faster than the normal rate. Doctors are concerned it may not be pumping enough blood around her body, and quickly prescribe fast-acting medication. Plus, students Jerry and Sakille turn up at the hospital after Jerry crashed her car on the way home from a party. While Jerry stayed sober to serve as the designated driver, she concludes that balancing a full-time job with her studies and a hectic social life might not be a sensible idea.(n)</desc>

Chevy mugs, trips, falls, mashes his fingers and stubs his toes as he prepares to invite numerous dysfunctional relatives to his household to celebrate Christmas. Amidst the more outrageous sight gags (including the electrocution of a cat as the Christmas tree is lit) the film betrays a sentimental streak, with old wounds healing and long-estranged relatives reuniting in the Griswold living room. National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation was still capable of attracting an audience five years after its release -- it was one of the top-rated seasonal TV specials of 1994, outrating even the first network telecast of It's a Wonderful Life(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Who Wants to Be a Millionaire</title>
    <desc lang="en">Although the once-hot game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? had lost its luster as a prime-time ABC offering, the producers felt that there was enough life left in the property to warrant a Monday-through-Friday syndicated version. Taking over from the earlier series' host Regis Philbin was Meredith Vieira of The View. To make certain that the series would not be bankrupted after its first week on the air, the questions posed to contestants were considerably harder than those on the prime-time incarnation. Also, the famous "fastest finger" round was eliminated, taking some of the pressure off the contestants when they struggled to come up with answers. The most noteworthy change from the original version was the absence of Regis Philbin's familiar catchphrases: One would never hear Meredith Vieira chime in with the legendary "Is that your final answer?" The syndicated Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? was launched on September 16, 2002(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">What can you do when you are your boss's boss? When he cannot even choose a tie without help? Sandra Bullock has handed in her resignation. But not without first getting an ulcer and spending whole nights without sleeping. She plays Lucy Kelson, an outstanding lawyer who becomes Chief Counsel for the Wade Corporation, in New York. The owner of the company is George Wade (Hugh Grant), a self-centered millionaire who seeks Lucy's advice on legal matters but also on personal issues. Fed up of being considered a nanny, she quits her job. But Wade says he will accept the resignation only if Lucy can find a replacement of her stature. This is how June Carver (Alicia Witt) appears, a young woman lawyer with nothing but bad intentions. As her distrust for June grows, Lucy perceives that she feels something different for her boss. But is she in time to reverse the situation?(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Yes Man</title>
    <desc lang="en">Jim Carrey stars with Bradley Cooper, Zooey Deschanel and Molly Sims in the true story of a man who goes an entire year without uttering the word "no," a normal, everyday citizen who, with a single word, becomes a most extraordinary Yes Man. Freelance BBC radio producer Danny Wallace takes three simple words uttered by a stranger on a bus-"say yes more"-as a challenge and says "yes" to everything for a year. He says "yes" to pamphleteers on the street, the credit card offers stuffing his mailbox and solicitations on the Internet. He attends meetings with a group that believes aliens built the pyramids in Egypt, says "yes" to every invitation to go out on the town and furthers his career by saying "yes" in meetings with executives. And, yes, he does win $48,000, meet the world's only hypnotic do, earn a nursing degree and travel the globe. It may be stranger than fiction, but every hilarious moment is true!(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">First-time screenwriter Stelios Pavlou enjoyed a major success with this script that he wrote while working in an English liquor store by sending it to actor Samuel L. Jackson, who signed on for one of the lead roles. Jackson is Elmo McElroy, a kilt-wearing, golf club-wielding Los Angeles native who has invented an illegal drug formula that he hopes will provide him with a last major score of 20 million dollars before he retires from a life of crime. He travels to Liverpool, England, where he hopes to find a buyer for his creation among the denizens of the city's rave scene, but his plans go awry when those who are in on the deal start turning up dead. Elmo's only protector is a chain-smoking, Yank-hating local hood named Felix De Souza (Robert Carlyle), who reluctantly partners with the violence-prone American to finish the deal and cash in, sparking a gang war between Elmo's vengeful one-time employer, The Lizard (Meat Loaf); Felix's boss, Durant (Ricky Tomlinson); crooked cop Virgil Kane (Sean Pertwee); a beautiful assassin, who also happens to be Felix's ex-girlfriend (Emily Mortimer); and an offbeat, yoga-practicing nightclub owner and mobster named Iki (Rhys Ifans). For its U.S. release, the title of The 51st State was changed to Formula 51(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Denzel Washington stars in this powerful and moving film about the early days of forced racial integration in the US, and how a high school football team helped bring in a new era of racial harmony. It's 1971. One all-white school and one all-black school have been forcibly merged, and a black coach appointed over the existing white football coach. It could be a recipe for disaster, but the two men shares certain qualities: integrity, honour and a strong work ethic. Together they mould a group of angry, disillusioned young men into a dynamic, winning football team - and provide a model for future integration. A top class film with a superb cast(n)</desc>

They also portray a pair of ageing lotharios and take a look back at some of Harry's comedy characters that never saw the light of day - until a certain Mr Walliams got his hands on them.

The Thunder from Down Under has already clinched one ranking event title this season, overcoming England's Michael Holt 5-2 in the final of the Riga Open in Latvia in June.

But living together often has its problems, like the Barbary macaques in Gibraltar who have their babies stolen by others out to impress their boss, the matriarchal ring-tailed lemur societies where females battle one another with their children in tow, and the hamadryas baboons of Ethiopia where the males rule with an iron fist.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Richard Hammond presents this chilly version of Total Wipeout, which sees the contestants wrapping up warm to tackle a snow-covered course with winter-themed obstacles and seasonal challenges. They must manoeuvre themselves past Granny's House, watching out for the angry dog nipping at their ankles and a front door guaranteed to smack them in the face. They then cling onto the ski lift to avoid plunging into the icy waters, before riding the conveyor belt that throws them onto those old Wipeout favourites, the big red balls. Amanda Byram laughs it up at the side of the course.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Free to Murder Again. The Texas penal system wakes up from a nightmare in the A&amp;E program American Justice: Free to Murder Again. The subject of the documentary is serial killer Kenneth McDuff, the biggest mistake the parole board ever made. McDuff was first sentenced to death in 1968 for killing three teenagers. Seemingly, his incarceration meant the end of his murder spree. But due to the overcrowding of Texas jails, McDuff was eventually released after serving only 21 years. Soon, the criminal was back on the streets harassing children and adults alike. In 1991, McDuff abducted and killed a young woman only to repeat the pattern two years later with a pregnant mother of two. When he was captured and resentenced to death, his murderous trail was reported to include a handful of others. McDuff's situation alerted the government to the failures of the parole boards. His case eventually resulted in a slew of new prison constructions and tough law reforms(n)</desc>

However, Britain still had a powerful navy and some of the finest fighter planes ever built and had also made two powerful technological breakthroughs - radar and the cracking of the German Enigma codes - that would give it a vital edge in the Battle of Britain. Prime minister Winston Churchill then began the fightback, with commando raids and help for the resistance in occupied Europe.(n)</desc>

Not only do the females have difficulty finding food for their young, but a fire destroys the cover they need to ambush the few animals that remain - and the number of cubs gradually dwindles to just two.(n)</desc>

Eve's sisters -- Georgia (Keaton), who is a few years older and the editor of a successful fashion magazine, and Maddy (Lisa Kudrow), a few years younger and a working actress with a spot on a soap opera -- have also had to deal with Dad, but only by long distance when he makes one of his frequent telephone calls. Dad now doesn't have long to live, and the siblings must pull together and make peace with their father and each other. Sisters Nora Ephron and Delia Ephron adapted the screenplay from Delia's novel; the supporting cast includes Adam Arkin, Cloris Leachman, and Mary Steenburgen(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me</title>
    <desc lang="en">Mike Myers is back as the self-styled sexiest spy in the world in this achingly funny sequel. This time Austin goes back to the 60s to trap his nemesis, Dr Evil - but Evil's not the only adversary he must face this time. There's also Evil's scaled-down accomplice Mini-Me, not to mention the grotesque Fat Bastard. Heather Graham co-stars as Austin's squeeze this time around, although there's a blink-and-you'll-miss-it reappearance by Liz Hurley from the first movie and additional appearances from the likes of Robert Wagner and Rob Lowe(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Snow Dogs</title>
    <desc lang="en">Miami dentist Ted Brooks is delighted to hear that he has been named his mother's will, and travels to Alaska to claim his inheritance. But he discovers his new property is slightly unusual: he now owns a team of sled dogs. It turns out his mother was an Alaskan sled-racing champion! Another shock awaits Ted in the frozen wastes: his real dad is a grumpy old white man who's only interested in Ted's dogs. The fun comes as thick and fast as a blizzard when Ted decides to gain his dad's respect by defending his mother's title. The only trouble is, he's never raced sled dogs in his life... Two Oscar winners come together in this hilarious movie, as Cuba Gooding Jr plays the dentist who spends a lot of his time up to his waist in snow, while James Coburn is his father, who's out to get his son's inheritance. Laughter comes in flurries as Gooding proves how cool he is, in a very different way from his normal roles!(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Whacked Out Sports</title>
    <desc lang="en">Generally telecast on the weekend late-night schedule, the half-hour Whacked Out Sports was a reality "clip" show devoted to unusual sports activities and embarrassing bloopers. The series' specialty seemed to be spotlighting eccentric contestants indulging in offbeat sports events with bizarre rules. In each market that the series played, viewers were invited to send in video clips of "crazy stuff never seen on TV" -- especially if "hot girls" were involved (that's what it said on the press release!). Seen on the NBC-owned stations in the larger markets, Whacked Out Sports was initially broadcast on September 7, 2006(n)</desc>

Mere end 40 år efter Neil Armstrongs historiske skridt forbereder mennesket sig på at vende tilbage til månen med et ambitiøst mål for øje: Der skal bygges en permanent base. Man bygger nye raketter og rumfærger og uddanner astronauter til den første månelanding i december 2019. I sommeren 2008 foretog astronauter en generalprøve af deres rejse til månen på Devon Island ved Nordpolen. Mandskabet på 30 mænd og kvinder slog lejr ved udkanten af Haughton-krateret, som er et 20 km bredt bækken, der blev skabt på den øde ø af et asteroidenedslag. Det er en tro kopi af Shackleton-krateret på månen, hvor de amerikanske, europæiske og japanske astronauter lander i 2019(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Amazing Spider-Man 2</title>
    <desc lang="en">The web-slingin' wall-crawler hits the screens once again in this follow-up to Marc Webb's 2012 reboot of the series. Andrew Garfield returns as Peter Parker, who squares off against the villainous Electro, played by Jamie Foxx. As the film opens, we find Richard (Campbell Scott) and Mary Parker (Embeth Davitz) stealing away with some crucial Oscorp files while leaving young Peter in the care of Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben. Flash forward about a decade, and Peter (Garfield) is swinging into action as Spider-Man; having successfully thwarted the hijacking of an Oscorp truck by notorious Russian criminal Aleksei Sytsevich (Paul Giamatti), Peter ditches the costume just in time to meet up with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) at their high school graduation. Despite his deep love for Emma, however, Peter remains haunted by his promise to her late father not to get emotionally involved with her for fear that she could be targeted by Spider-Man's enemies. Meanwhile, young Harry Osborne (Dane DeHaan) inherits OsCorp and a deadly retrovirus from his father Norman (Chris Cooper), and brilliant but timid OsCorp scientist Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx) gets infused with a powerful dose of electricity while attempting to fix a faulty power circuit in the lab. Upon regaining consciousness, Max discovers that he has the power to harness electrical currents - the higher the voltage the more powerful he becomes. When a battle with Max in Times Square shorts out Spidey's web-shooters, Peter goes to work on developing a more reliable model of his signature weapon while Harry grows convinced that Spider-Man's blood is the key to his survival. Later, villainous OsCorp chairman Donald Menken (Colm Feore) steals the company out right out from under Harry, driving the vengeful youth to break Max -- now Electro -- out of the heavily-guarded Ravencroft Institute for a two-pronged attack on Menken and Spider-Man. The stage for that battle is set when New York City goes dark just as Peter declares his love to Gwen, plunging the wise-cracking web-slinger into a fight that could forever alter the course of his life(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Drumline</title>
    <desc lang="en">After decades of movies about college sports, the bands who take the field at halftime finally get their day in the sun in this musical comedy drama. Devon Miles (Nick Cannon) is a talented young percussionist from Harlem who wins a music scholarship to Atlanta A &amp; T, a prestigious African-American university. For years, Atlanta A &amp; T has won awards for their show-style marching band, who combine expert musicianship (incorporating funk, R&amp;B, and jazz rhythms into the traditional marching band repertoire) with choreography, dancing cheerleaders, and roof-raising showmanship. Dr. Aaron Lee (Orlando Jones), the school's band director, gives Devon a spot in the marching band's drumline, the heart and soul of a show-style band, but discovers Devon's previous musical education hardly meets his usual standard when he learns that his new drummer can't read music. Devon soon earns a reputation as a stubborn individualist within the band, not necessarily a good thing in an ensemble where a strictly unified performance is considers the ideal. Devon's cocksure attitude and streetwise style doesn't mesh very comfortably with Sean Taylor (Leonard Roberts), a disciplined senior who resents the presence of the upstart freshman in the drumline, and things become even less harmonious when Devon begins making a play for Laila (Zoe Saldana), a beautiful girl who is also being courted by Sean. Songwriter and record producer Dallas Austin, who has worked with Boyz II Men, TLC, and Pink, served as executive producer for Drumline, helped produce the film's musical score, and contributed his own experiences as a marching band member to the screenplay(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Drumline</title>
    <desc lang="en">After decades of movies about college sports, the bands who take the field at halftime finally get their day in the sun in this musical comedy drama. Devon Miles (Nick Cannon) is a talented young percussionist from Harlem who wins a music scholarship to Atlanta A &amp; T, a prestigious African-American university. For years, Atlanta A &amp; T has won awards for their show-style marching band, who combine expert musicianship (incorporating funk, R&amp;B, and jazz rhythms into the traditional marching band repertoire) with choreography, dancing cheerleaders, and roof-raising showmanship. Dr. Aaron Lee (Orlando Jones), the school's band director, gives Devon a spot in the marching band's drumline, the heart and soul of a show-style band, but discovers Devon's previous musical education hardly meets his usual standard when he learns that his new drummer can't read music. Devon soon earns a reputation as a stubborn individualist within the band, not necessarily a good thing in an ensemble where a strictly unified performance is considers the ideal. Devon's cocksure attitude and streetwise style doesn't mesh very comfortably with Sean Taylor (Leonard Roberts), a disciplined senior who resents the presence of the upstart freshman in the drumline, and things become even less harmonious when Devon begins making a play for Laila (Zoe Saldana), a beautiful girl who is also being courted by Sean. Songwriter and record producer Dallas Austin, who has worked with Boyz II Men, TLC, and Pink, served as executive producer for Drumline, helped produce the film's musical score, and contributed his own experiences as a marching band member to the screenplay(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Following their television series Home Improvement and the features The Santa Clause (1994) and Jungle 2 Jungle (1997), the actor/director team of Tim Allen and John Pasquin collaborate once again on this high-concept comedy. Allen stars as Joe Scheffer, a nice guy video specialist for a Minneapolis pharmaceutical company who's plodding through both his thankless job and an unhappy divorce from his ex-wife Callie (Kelly Lynch). When Joe brings his daughter Natalie (Hayden Panettiere) to the office with him on Take Our Kids to Work Day, he's humiliated in a spat with company bully Mark McKinney (Patrick Warburton) over a parking space. It's the last straw for the mild-mannered Joe, who challenges McKinney to a rematch, hires a has-been action movie star (Jim Belushi) to instruct him in martial arts, and pays a stylist to make over his wardrobe and hair. As Joe's image improves and the big day approaches, he finds his new self-respecting stance has positive effects in both the workplace, as he lands a long-overdue promotion, and in his romantic life, as both Callie and a cute "wellness coordinator" (Julie Bowen) start warming up to him. The levelheaded Natalie, however, seems to prefer the previously non-confrontational dad she already loved. Joe Somebody (2001) is the feature debut of screenwriter John Scott Shepherd, who actually worked as a corporate filmmaker in Minneapolis(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Romantic comedy directed by Adam Brooks. Ryan Reynolds plays Will Hayes, an advertising executive whose marriage is on the cusp of ending in divorce. But before it does, his 10-year-old daughter Maya asks her father to explain how he met her mother. Instead of giving her a straight answer, Reynolds recounts his relationships with three women over the previous 16 years, changing their names and then inviting Maya to guess which woman he married. So, did Reynolds fall for his college sweetheart Emily; the kooky apolitical friend April he met while working on the Bill Clinton campaign in 1992; or is she the ambitious, carefree journalist Summer?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Following their television series Home Improvement and the features The Santa Clause (1994) and Jungle 2 Jungle (1997), the actor/director team of Tim Allen and John Pasquin collaborate once again on this high-concept comedy. Allen stars as Joe Scheffer, a nice guy video specialist for a Minneapolis pharmaceutical company who's plodding through both his thankless job and an unhappy divorce from his ex-wife Callie (Kelly Lynch). When Joe brings his daughter Natalie (Hayden Panettiere) to the office with him on Take Our Kids to Work Day, he's humiliated in a spat with company bully Mark McKinney (Patrick Warburton) over a parking space. It's the last straw for the mild-mannered Joe, who challenges McKinney to a rematch, hires a has-been action movie star (Jim Belushi) to instruct him in martial arts, and pays a stylist to make over his wardrobe and hair. As Joe's image improves and the big day approaches, he finds his new self-respecting stance has positive effects in both the workplace, as he lands a long-overdue promotion, and in his romantic life, as both Callie and a cute "wellness coordinator" (Julie Bowen) start warming up to him. The levelheaded Natalie, however, seems to prefer the previously non-confrontational dad she already loved. Joe Somebody (2001) is the feature debut of screenwriter John Scott Shepherd, who actually worked as a corporate filmmaker in Minneapolis(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Racing Stripes</title>
    <desc lang="en">A horse of a different pattern becomes a spoiler in a high-stakes race in the family-friendly comedy-drama. Nolan Walsh (Bruce Greenwood) is a farmer who once earned his living training racehorses before his wife was killed in an accident while riding, which led him to leave the racing game. Nolan tends to his farm and looks after his daughter Channing (Hayden Panettiere) and a large flock of animals, who speak to one another but not to humans. After a traveling circus passes through town, a zebra pony is left behind; Nolan takes in the animal, intending to return it to the circus, but at Channing's insistence they keep the zebra, naming him Stripes (voiced by Frankie Muniz). Channing loves Stripes, and the zebra is welcomed by the other critters on the farm, including grumpy Shetland pony Tucker (voiced by Dustin Hoffman), slow-moving hound dog Lightning (voiced by Snoop Dogg), a New Jersey-born pelican named Goose (voiced by Joe Pantoliano), skinny-brained rooster Reggie (voiced by Jeff Foxworthy), and deep-thinking goat Franny (voiced by Whoopi Goldberg). Channing discovers that Stripes can outrun nearly any horse around, and Woodzie (M. Emmett Walsh), a local character who has spent years handicapping the ponies, is convinced the zebra would be shoo-in in the Kentucky Open, a prestigious race held at the estate of champion horse breeder Clara Dalrymple (Wendie Malick). Channing believes Stripes can win, but he'll need the help of Nolan, who isn't so sure he's ready to start training again; meanwhile, Stripes gets plenty of advice from the other farm animals about his big step onto the race track. Mandy Moore, David Spade, and Steve Harvey also contribute their voice talents to the picture(n)</desc>

Joining forces with another group of survivors following a terrifying encounter in a seemingly abandoned church, Jim soon learns the truth behind the deserted streets and the menacing creatures that lurk in the shadows. It's soon revealed that the chimpanzees had been harboring a deadly virus that sends its victims into a furious, murderous rage, and in the days following the initial exposure, the entire population was nearly wiped out due to the resulting homicidal rampage. Is there still a glimmer of hope for humanity -- or has the deadly "rage" virus found its way to foreign shores and infected the entire planet?(n)</desc>

Rob (John Cusack), an obsessive record collector in his mid-thirties, is struggling to reconcile his adolescent enthusiasm for pop music with adult responsibilities and a more mature outlook. He runs a record shop with his friends Barry (Jack Black) and Dick (Todd Louiso), who are known to drive away customers whose taste in music doesn't match their exacting standards -- which may have something to do with why the shop is losing money. But Rob's biggest problem is his failing relationship with Laura (Iben Hjejle), a lawyer who needs more out of the relationship than Rob is capable of giving. To Rob's horror, Laura starts dating Ian (Tim Robbins), his upstairs neighbor, known throughout the building for his long and noisy sex sessions. Rob, on the other hand, finds himself catching the attention of singer/songwriter Marie DeSalle (Lisa Bonet), as he tries to deal with his breakup by tracking down his previous ex-girlfriends and taking a fresh look at what he's been doing wrong. Based on the acclaimed novel by Nick Hornby, High Fidelity also features Catherine Zeta-Jones, Lili Taylor, and Joelle Carter as three of Rob's ex-lovers, and Sara Gilbert as Dick's new girlfriend, who gets a crash course in U.K. punk bands that influenced Green Day(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Note</title>
    <desc lang="en">A struggling human interest columnist finds a simple scrap of paper with a profound message may be the key to saving her column from cancellation in this inspirational, made for television drama starring Genie Francis and Ted McGinley. Peyton MacGruder (Francis) is the "Heart Healer" columnist for the local Middleborough Times newspaper. It's Christmas time, and just as the crew of Flight 848 reports a minor electrical problem, Peyton is summoned to her editor's office for a serious discussion about the future of the "Heart Healer" column. According to the results of a recent reader's survey, the "Heart Healer" column was voted the least interesting item that the paper had to offer, and as a result Peyton is about to get the axe. Just as Peyton's editor warns the writer to improve her standing with readers of hit the pavement, word breaks in the newsroom that Flight 848 has crashed, killing everyone aboard. King Danville, Peyton's friend and colleague at the paper, has lost a dear friend in the crash. Pondering whether or not the passengers realized they were going to die while drowning his sorrows at the local sports bar, King wonders aloud whether they had time to say goodbye to their loved ones, half-jokingly suggesting that Peyton work the concept into her failing column. The following day, Peyton is jogging along the beach when she spies smarmy television reporter Truman Harris interrupting a memorial service for the victims, all the while struggling to find an angle that doesn't seem exploitative. That angle arrives in the form of a note that Peyton finds during another walk along the coast. Sealed inside a small plastic bag half filled with cookie crumbs is a note to "T" from "Dad." Peyton is deeply moved by the heartfelt note, and vows to use the "Heart Healer" column as a means for getting the note to its intended recipient. In order to do so, however, Peyton will be forced to contend with her television counterpart Harris, a tactless reporter whose penchant for sensationalizing a story is only matched by his willingness to resort to underhanded tactics in order to take sole credit for all of Peyton's hard work. And while tracking down "T" proves no easy task, Peyton quickly discovers that her latest story truly resonates with readers upon being informed by her publisher that her "Heart Healers" column has gained a loyal following across the country(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The origins of the Caped Crusader of Gotham City are finally brought to the big screen in this new adaptation of the perennially popular comic-book series. As a child, Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) lived a comfortable life as the son of wealthy parents, but the realities of life in crime-ridden Gotham City were brought home to him when his mother and father were murdered. Wayne pledged to bring justice and order back to the city and avenge the death of his parents, and one day he is approached by Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), a teacher who guides him in the study of martial arts and the ways in which an ordinary man can become a champion. With the help of Ducard and gadget master Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), Wayne develops a secret identity as Batman, a masked fighter for justice who is determined to bring peace and safety back to Gotham. Batman Begins also features Michael Caine as faithful manservant Alfred Pennyworth, Gary Oldman as Lt. James Gordon, Katie Holmes as Wayne's sweetheart, Rachel Dawes, and Cillian Murphy as the villainous Scarecrow(n)</desc>

Learning to hunt is key to the cubs' chances of surviving in the wild. But this task is a daunting one. The East African plains are full of enemies.

    <desc lang="en">The One with Two Parts. Part two of The One with the Two Parts is a hospital farce. Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) has to go to a doctor, but has no insurance. To alleviate the problem, Monica (Courteney Cox) and Rachel switch identities so that Rachel can use Monica's coverage. Complications ensue when the two become attracted to their doctors (guest stars George Clooney and Noah Wyle). Asked out on dates by the cute practitioners, Monica and Rachel begin to bicker over who will date who -- listing each other's worst attributes in front of the doctors. Meanwhile, Joey (Matt LeBlanc) and Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) are not getting along because Joey is still dating Phoebe's twin sister, Ursula, forgetting Phoebe's birthday -- despite the fact that the identical siblings share the same birthday. Finally, Ross (David Schwimmer) is still afraid of being a father until Marcel the Monkey swallows some Scrabble tiles and Ross has to rush him to the hospital. His ability to take care of Marcel convinces him that he can handle fatherhood. This episode originally aired on February 23, 1995(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Inside the GPO</title>
    <desc lang="en">Documentary marking the 100th anniversary of the Easter Rising by going behind the scenes at the GPO, Ireland's busiest post office. Perhaps best known for serving as the Dublin headquarters of the uprising's leaders back in 1916, the historic building on O'Connel Street has been home to An Post since 1984, and currently staffed by 950 people responsible for everything from co-ordinating mail delivery, to keeping the facilities suitably tidy. The series begins with an introduction to cleaner Sue Gannon and patrolman Philip Freer, best friends who started working at the GPO on the same day back in 1997, and branch manager Shay Cullen, who hopes to make the GPO the leading office in the An Post league tables following a dismal performance two years ago.(n)</desc>

Nick Marshall (Mel Gibson) is a successful advertising executive living in Chicago who has long fancied himself a ladies' man, though he has precious little understanding of women beyond figuring out how to seduce them. One day, Nick receives a substantial electric shock in an accident in his bathroom; while he's not seriously injured, when he comes to, he discovers something remarkable has happened -- he can suddenly hear what women are thinking. At first, Nick finds himself learning all sorts of things he didn't want to know, but he also realizes how this can be used to his advantage -- especially after his old boss, Dan Wanamaker (Alan Alda) is replaced by a woman, Darcy Maguire (Helen Hunt). But Nick begins to feel differently about his unusual gift when he discovers Darcy is infatuated with him, and he finds himself falling for her. What Women Want also features Bette Midler as Nick's analyst, Delta Burke and Valerie Perrine as two of his co-workers, and Marisa Tomei as one of Nick's significant others(n)</desc>

A likeable young man despite his depressive disposition, Zia (Patrick Fugit) puts blade to wrist only to find that the pain of life doesn't end with the coming of death. Now trapped in a bleak metaphysical landscape populated entirely by suicide victims blearily searching for the joys that eluded them in the physical realm, Zia soon learns that the love is one of the latest arrivals in the dreary land of the dead. As Zia sets out to locate his ill-fated former companion and experience the joys that eluded the couple in life, he is joined in his quest by a lovelorn Russian rocker named Eugene (Shea Wigham) and an accidental tourist named Mikal (Shannyn Sossamon), who's looking for a way out of the sorrowful stir(n)</desc>

Though his mother may not have a clue as to what fate is about to befall her frightened child, a group of specially appointed guardians who have been watching over Timmy since birth know the truth about the events that are beginning to unfold. Timmy is a half-blood, and when the red moon is full, the creature who once appeared to be a normal boy will finally gain the power to take control of his family's destiny. But until that fateful night, Timmy's life will be in constant danger by the renegade faction of lycanthropes who are willing to kill in order to maintain their vicious way of life. It won't be long until the red moon rises, but until that prophesied moment, the forces of light and the forces of darkness will clash in the ultimate battle for true supremacy. Jason X director James Isaac takes the helm for a frightening tale of fate and fantasy co-starring Elias Koteas, Jason Behr, and Kim Coates(n)</desc>

A likeable young man despite his depressive disposition, Zia (Patrick Fugit) puts blade to wrist only to find that the pain of life doesn't end with the coming of death. Now trapped in a bleak metaphysical landscape populated entirely by suicide victims blearily searching for the joys that eluded them in the physical realm, Zia soon learns that the love is one of the latest arrivals in the dreary land of the dead. As Zia sets out to locate his ill-fated former companion and experience the joys that eluded the couple in life, he is joined in his quest by a lovelorn Russian rocker named Eugene (Shea Wigham) and an accidental tourist named Mikal (Shannyn Sossamon), who's looking for a way out of the sorrowful stir(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Shadow Zone: The Undead Express</title>
    <desc lang="en">A horror semi-parody targeted at the young adult market that ravenously gobbles up horror books like R.L. Stine's Goosebumps series, this made-for-TV vampire tale stars Chauncey Leopardi as Zach, a teenage rebel with a flair for telling ghost stories, who stumbles on an underground cabal of vampires when he takes a fateful ride on a New York subway. The vampire's leader, Valentine (Ron Silver), proposes a deal to young Zach, offering him safe passage to the world above, thus enabling the trapped vampire -- who can only mingle with humanity through the willing assistance of an innocent youth -- to reach the surface as well. Our young hero balks at this idea and escapes to the surface with a wild story for his skeptical pals, who shun him until one of their number is kidnapped by the undead subway dwellers in exchange for Zach's cooperation. Though atmospherically photographed, this low-budget production is a bit too corny to provide either laughs or chills, and it suffers further from lethargic pacing(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Set in 1991, just three years before the release of Jeff Buckley's debut album Grace and six years before his untimely death at age 30, director Dan Algrant's Greetings From Tim Buckley follows the troubled young musician as he prepares to participate in a tribute concert for his late father while at the same time struggling to emerge from under his father's colossal shadow. As the concert at St. Ann's Church approaches, rising musician Tim (Penn Badgley) wrestles with the anger of being abandoned by his dad (who later died of a drug overdose), and starts to fall for a Allie (Imogen Poots), a pretty intern who's helping to organize the performance.

When his ex-wife Susan (Teri Polo) announces that she's getting remarried to Rick Barnes (Vince Vaughn), a recent arrival in town and a popular, wealthy philanthropist, Frank struggles with jealousy but feels that Rick might be a stabilizing influence for his son. When Danny begins relating unsettling stories about Rick, Frank at first chalks it up to youthful rebellion, but when Danny stridently claims to have witnessed his new stepfather committing murder, Frank's instincts tell him the story is true. As he investigates the new man in his family's life, Frank uncovers alarming facts about Rick, who's not the man he appears to be.

An investigation into police corruption has led Avila and his partner, Sgt. Amy Wallace (Laurie Metcalf), to Officer Dennis Peck (Richard Gere). Avila suspects something about Peck from the beginning; his influence and dominance over others seems to extend further than the reach of his badge. When officers who wish to testify against Peck start dying, the depth of his corruption becomes increasingly clear; at his disposal, he has an army of cops and criminals alike. He even agrees to assassinate a sleazy businessman's own parents, and humiliates the businessman while they make the deal. In his drive to dominate others, Peck attempts to seduce almost every woman around him and is obsessed with children and fatherhood. Peck is most dangerous when the investigation threatens his territory and his extended family; he stalks Avila and turns him against his wife (Nancy Travis)(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Boiler Room</title>
    <desc lang="en">In this drama that explores greed and corruption in American business, Giovanni Ribisi plays Seth Davis, an intelligent and ambitious college dropout who runs a casino in his apartment. Eager to show his father that he can succeed, Seth lands a job with a small stock brokerage firm. He is given a space in the company's "boiler room," where he makes cold calls to prospective clients. As it turns out, Seth has a genuine talent for cold calling, which gains him the approval of his superiors, the admiration of his father, and the attentions of one of his co-workers, Abby Hilliard (Nia Long). However, the higher up the ladder Seth rises, the deeper he sinks into a quagmire of dirty dealings, until he's breaking the law in order to keep his bosses happy and his paychecks coming. The Boiler Room also features Tom Everett Scott, Scott Caan, Jamie Kennedy, Nicky Katt, and Ben Affleck in a cameo as the headhunter who brings Seth into the firm. Ribisi and Scott also appeared together in That Thing You Do; Ribisi was the drummer replaced by Scott, who then led The One-Ders to fictional pop stardom(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Emperor's Club</title>
    <desc lang="en">A dedicated teacher learns some important lessons about himself years after he retired from the classroom in this drama. William Hundert (Kevin Kline) is an instructor at St. Benedict's School for Boys, an exclusive private academy on the East Coast where Hundert drills his charges on the moral lessons to be learned through the study of Greek and Roman philosophers. Hundert is fond of telling his students, "A man's character is his fate," and he strives to impress upon them the importance of the ordered and examined life. In 1976, however, Hundert finds himself with an especially challenging group of students -- party-minded Fred Masoudi (Jesse Eisenberg) , introverted Martin Blythe (Paul Dano), bright but mischievous Deepak Mehta (Rishi Mehta), and most notably, openly rebellious Sedgewick Bell (Emile Hirsch). The son of a powerful politician, Bell pointedly runs against the current of Hundert's example, questioning the importance of the material, flouting the school's rules, talking out of turn in class, and devoting as much time to his interest in girls as in his studies. However, Hundert sees the possibility of great things in Bell, and encourages him to take part in the school's annual academic competition for the title of Mr. Julius Caesar. Hundert even goes so far as to bend the rules in scoring to favor Bell in the early stages of the contest, but his faith is betrayed when Bell is discovered cheating during the contest finals. Years later, Hundert is reunited with his students, where they learn the years have taught them all a great deal about their virtues and weaknesses. The Emperor's Club also features Harris Yulin, Rob Morrow, and Edward Herrmann(n)</desc>

Ben (Jimmy Fallon) is a high-school teacher who meets Lindsay (Drew Barrymore), who has a successful career in business. Ben and Lindsay don't appear to have much in common on the surface, but they hit it off and are soon involved in a serious romance. But when spring rolls around, Lindsay becomes aware of the true love of Ben's life -- the Boston Red Sox. Despite the team's lamentable record, Ben has been a fiercely loyal Red Sox fan since childhood, and Lindsay finds it hard to compete with his passion for baseball, while Ben is forced to choose between the obsessions of his youth and the enthusiasms of a responsible adult. Fever Pitch was shot in part in Boston during the 2004 baseball season, which to the surprise of the filmmakers saw the Red Sox winning baseball's world series for the first time since 1918(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Based on the novel by John Katzenbach, author of Just Cause (1995), this prison camp drama combines elements of A Soldier's Story (1984) and the classic Stalag 17 (1953). Colin Farrell stars as Lt. Tommy Hart, a second-year Harvard Law School student who enlists to fight in World War II but ends up being taken prisoner by the Germans. When a murder at the Nazi-run Stalag Luft 13 leaves a black Tuskegee airman named Lt. Lincoln Scott (Terrence Dashon Howard) accused of the crime, high-ranking prisoner (and fourth-generation war hero) Col. William McNamara (Bruce Willis) persuades camp commandant Col. Werner Visser (Marcel Iures) to allow the prisoners to hold their own trial. Hart is recruited to defend his fellow officer, but as he reluctantly investigates, he discovers that not all of his fellow allied soldiers are fighting the same war and that his "client" may well have been framed. In the meantime, it becomes apparent that McNamara is using events to mask his true intent, a mission to destroy a nearby munitions plant that he still intends to carry out despite his incarceration. Hart's War (2002) co-stars Vicellous Shannon, Cole Hauser, Rory Cochrane, and Jonathan Brandis(n)</desc>

Alec Baldwin plays Mackin, a career thief who picks his jobs shrewdly and carefully, and prefers to spend his downtime with his collection of rare jazz LP's and looking after his dog. Pointy (Michael Jai White) is a young upstart gangster trying to develop a taste for refinement and the good life. When Pointy sets up Mackin, Mackin is forced to retaliate, and before long both men and their associates are in the middle of a war neither is especially interested in winning, which begins to escalate in comic fashion. The skirmish eventually attracts the attention of a female cop (Rebecca De Mornay) who's become interested in Mackin's method of operation.

    <title lang="en">Moonlight Mile</title>
    <desc lang="en">A family attempts to deal with the emotional impact of an unexpected loss in this emotional drama set in the early 1970s. Diana Floss (Careena Melia) is a woman in her early twenties who is only days away from marrying her boyfriend, Joe Nast (Jake Gyllenhaal), to the delight of her parents, Ben and Jo Jo (Dustin Hoffman and Susan Sarandon). However, Diana finds herself in the wrong place at the wrong time when an altercation breaks out in a diner, and she's murdered for no good reason. Ben and Jo Jo are devastated, and they both turn to Joe for comfort, treating him as a member of the family, with Ben offering him a job at his real estate firm and Jo Jo grateful for his company, despite her unflappable surface. Joe also finds himself needing comfort, and he becomes involved with Bertie (Ellen Pompeo), a woman who waits tables at a local watering hole owned by her boyfriend, who has been listed as Missing in Action in Vietnam for the past three years. However, as the wheels of justice slowly turn and the Floss' lawyer, Mona Camp (Holly Hunter), prepares Ben and Jo Jo for the upcoming murder trial, Joe is tortured by a guilty secret -- he and Diana had a falling out, and planned to call off the wedding shortly before her unexpected death. Moonlight Mile was written and directed by Brad Silberling, who has had his own experiences with death and grieving to draw from -- he was dating actress Rebecca Schaeffer when she was murdered by a stalker in 1989(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A woman approaching middle age yet still childless decides to get pregnant by artificial insemination, only to discover that the donor she chose may not be the father of her child in this comedy starring Jennifer Aniston and Jason Bateman. Wally Mars (Bateman) is a dyed-in-the-wool pessimist. Hopelessly neurotic and unrepentantly narcissistic, he gets no joy out of life except for the time he spends with his best friend Kassie (Jennifer Aniston). However, despite the fact that Wally pines to be more than just friends with Kassie, she isn't convinced they'd make a good couple. When Kassie announces to Wally that she's found the perfect sperm donor, he's crestfallen; as far as he's concerned, the ideal candidate is standing right in front of her. Later, Kassie selects handsome stranger Roland (Patrick Wilson) to provide the seed. Things get complicated when Kassie's best friend Debbie (Juliette Lewis) throws an "insemination party" to commemorate the big event, and Wally intercepts Roland's special delivery, drunkenly replacing it with his own before blacking out. Pregnant and content, Kassie leaves the city for Minnesota, where she gives birth to a healthy baby boy. Flash-forward seven years, and Kassie returns to New York with her son, Sebastian (Thomas Robinson), who shares an uncanny number of physical and psychological traits with embittered bachelor Wally. Before long Wally and Sebastian have become good friends, and Wally becomes convinced that the boy is his biological son. His ideal family is finally within reach, and if he can just figure out a means of breaking the news to Kassie gently, perhaps she'll find it in her heart to forgive him, and recognize that he'll make the perfect father for Sebastian(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A brutal, gory revenge thriller starring Gerard Butler and directed by F Gary Gray. Could anything be worse than seeing your wife and child brutally killed in front of you? Well, probably not, but seeing one of their killers walk free after striking a bargain with the prosecuting lawer wouldn't make things any easier. And so it is for Clyde Shelton. But the experience doesn't destroy him; instead it eats away at him for a decade, until he snaps and takes sadistic revenge on the freed murderer. And then, even after he himself has been jailed, he embarks on a deadly campaign against everyone else connected with the case - including the police and legal representatives. Also starring Jamie Foxx, Leslie Bibb and Colm Meaney(n)</desc>
