    <title lang="en">The Royal House of Windsor</title>
    <desc lang="en">The royal documentary continues, charting the drama and intrigue of Prince Charles' love-life via intimate letters. In the 1970s, the Prince of Wales resolved to avoid repeating the mistakes of his great uncle, King Edward VIII, and sought advice on marriage from another great uncle - Lord Mountbatten. Taking the heir apparent under his wing, Mountbatten fashioned himself as kingmaker, and arranged a secret meeting in Paris, allowing Charles to meet his disgraced `Uncle David' in person. The prince developed a sympathetic view of the exiled king, and his example fails to stop Charles falling in love with an unsuitable woman, who ends up marrying one of her many past boyfriends. Returning to his first love, Camilla Parker Bowles - now a mother of two - stability continues to elude Charles, until pressure from all sides prompts him to turn his eye to Lady Diana Spencer.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Ghost World</title>
    <desc lang="en">Filmmaker Terry Zwigoff, who enjoyed breakthrough success with his 1994 documentary Crumb, shifts gears as he examines the lives of two young women on the verge of leaving their adolescence behind in his first dramatic feature. Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) are two close friends who've just graduated from high school, and are trying to decide what to do with their lives. Enid is a dark-haired arch cynic who is tired of living at home with her ineffectual dad (Bob Balaban) and his annoyingly perky girlfriend Maxine (Teri Garr), while Rebecca is prettier and a bit cheerier, but no more certain about her future. While the two girls have vague plans of getting an apartment together, they seem content to while away their summer hanging out and indulging in their shared infatuation with Josh (Brad Renfro), a friend from school who works at a convenience store and doesn't seem to be especially attracted to either of them. Enid discovers that in order to get her diploma, she'll have to take an additional class over the summer, where she winds up studying art with Roberta (Illeana Douglas), who is determined to encourage Enid's creative impulses, whether Enid likes it or not. More significantly, Enid meets Seymour (Steve Buscemi), a geeky record collector more than twice her age, and while they would seem to have little in common (and Rebecca thinks he's a creep), Enid discovers a kindred spirit in fellow misfit Seymour, who shares her disgust with the world around them, and a relationship begins to develop between the two. Ghost World is based on the award-winning graphic novel by comic artist Daniel Clowes, who also wrote the film's screenplay(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Katie Derham makes use of archive footage and family records to tell the story of how Vera Lynn came to become one of the UK's most well-known musical stars. Vera celebrates her 100th birthday on March 20th, and marks the occasion by reminiscing about her early days in showbusiness, with help from her daughter Virginia. She recalls starting out as Vera Welch in the 1920s, first appearing on stage at the tender age of seven, before charming the nation's servicemen and becoming the `forces sweetheart' during the Second World War. She also remembers becoming the first British artist to achieve a number one in America in the 1950s, and a similar feat in 2009, when she became the oldest living singer to reach the same position in the UK charts. Along the way, Second World War veterans and entertainment industry figures - including Paul McCartney, Barry Humphries and Miriam Margolyes - pay tribute to the power of her voice.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Morecambe and Wise Story: Look Back in Laughter</title>
    <desc lang="en">Documentary making use of old performances, chat-show appearances and archive interviews to shed light on the success of Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise. The film explores the pair's working-class roots in the north of England, and their early encounters. Eric's mother Sadie claimed to be the first person to spot their potential as a comedy double-act when, as children, they spent an entire train journey to Coventry annoying her with their antics. The Second World War would see the duo split up, but they were reunited by chance, and by 1968 they had become established household names, and were on track to become the most-watched comedy act in the history of British TV.(n)</desc>

Budgerigars swarm in the Australian desert, gathering at a precious waterhole, and although birds of prey try to ambush them, they are mesmerised by the array of bright colours on show. On the island of Borneo, a bearded pig hunts for seafood on the beach, while in the Rajasthan desert, nomads haggle over the price of camels, which can provide vital transport during this lean season. The mugger crocodiles of Sri Lanka stalk the animals taking a much-needed drink and a young leopard learning to hunt discovers there is no such thing as an easy meal. Colin Salmon narrates.(n)</desc>

Budgerigars swarm in the Australian desert, gathering at a precious waterhole, and although birds of prey try to ambush them, they are mesmerised by the array of bright colours on show. On the island of Borneo, a bearded pig hunts for seafood on the beach, while in the Rajasthan desert, nomads haggle over the price of camels, which can provide vital transport during this lean season. The mugger crocodiles of Sri Lanka stalk the animals taking a much-needed drink and a young leopard learning to hunt discovers there is no such thing as an easy meal. Colin Salmon narrates.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Jaws 3</title>
    <desc lang="en">An ocean-themed Florida amusement park comes under attack from an angry Great White shark in this third installment of the horror series. The film maintains only a loose relationship to the original Steven Spielberg hit, centering on Mike (Dennis Quaid) and Sean (John Putch), the sons of police chief Martin Brody (originally played by Roy Scheider). Mike works at Sea World, where a baby Great White shark has accidentially been let into the park. Soon, the baby's vicious and extremely powerful mother comes in search of her child. The film focuses most of its attention on the series of tense shark attacks that follow, as tourists run for their lives while the park workers struggle to destroy the sharp-toothed beast. The suspense sequences were made somewhat more memorable during the film's original release with 3-D photography, an attribute lost on video, thereby removing the most distinctive element of an otherwise run-of-the-mill sequel(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Miami Rhapsody</title>
    <desc lang="en">The discovery of marital troubles in her family causes a young woman to question her own upcoming nuptials in this clever romantic comedy. Sarah Jessica Parker stars as Gwyn, a bright, slightly neurotic advertising copywriter who is initially thrilled when her boyfriend Matt (Gil Bellows) finally proposes. Soon afterwards, however, she learns that her mother Nina (Mia Farrow) is indulging in an extra-marital affair with a handsome Latin stud (Antonio Banderas). This is only the first of several shocking revelations, as Gwyn soon learns of infidelity by her father (Paul Mazursky), brother (Kevin Pollack), and even newlywed sister (Carla Gugino). These indiscretions make Gwyn question the validity of the entire institution of marriage and doubt her own future. Director David Frankel, who also penned the screenplay, follows in the footsteps of Woody Allen in using introspective dialogue to detail the romantic troubles of a wealthy, neurotic Jewish family; practiced performances and a colorful use of Miami locations give the film its own personality(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Miami Rhapsody</title>
    <desc lang="en">The discovery of marital troubles in her family causes a young woman to question her own upcoming nuptials in this clever romantic comedy. Sarah Jessica Parker stars as Gwyn, a bright, slightly neurotic advertising copywriter who is initially thrilled when her boyfriend Matt (Gil Bellows) finally proposes. Soon afterwards, however, she learns that her mother Nina (Mia Farrow) is indulging in an extra-marital affair with a handsome Latin stud (Antonio Banderas). This is only the first of several shocking revelations, as Gwyn soon learns of infidelity by her father (Paul Mazursky), brother (Kevin Pollack), and even newlywed sister (Carla Gugino). These indiscretions make Gwyn question the validity of the entire institution of marriage and doubt her own future. Director David Frankel, who also penned the screenplay, follows in the footsteps of Woody Allen in using introspective dialogue to detail the romantic troubles of a wealthy, neurotic Jewish family; practiced performances and a colorful use of Miami locations give the film its own personality(n)</desc>

Al Pacino is Carlito Brigante, a high-level Puerto Rican drug dealer sprung from a three-decade jail sentence after only five years, thanks to a technicality and his sleazy, cocaine-addled lawyer, Dave Kleinfeld (Sean Penn). Carlito renounces his previous ways and takes a job as the manager of a club that Kleinfeld has invested in, planning to save enough money so that he can eventually move to the Caribbean. But no sooner is Carlito back on the streets of New York than his old life claws at him in the form of both old partners (Luis Guzman) and vicious up-and-comers (John Leguizamo). Nevertheless, Carlito stays clean and even restarts his relationship with a dancer named Gail (Penelope Ann Miller), until he is finally led astray by Kleinfeld, who manipulates Carlito into participating in the murder of a Mafia don from whom Kleinfeld has stolen a million dollars. At that point, the race is on to see whether Carlito and Gail can escape his world for good. The film is based on two novels about Carlito written by New York State judge Edwin Torres(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Drumline</title>
    <desc lang="en">After decades of movies about college sports, the bands who take the field at halftime finally get their day in the sun in this musical comedy drama. Devon Miles (Nick Cannon) is a talented young percussionist from Harlem who wins a music scholarship to Atlanta A &amp; T, a prestigious African-American university. For years, Atlanta A &amp; T has won awards for their show-style marching band, who combine expert musicianship (incorporating funk, R&amp;B, and jazz rhythms into the traditional marching band repertoire) with choreography, dancing cheerleaders, and roof-raising showmanship. Dr. Aaron Lee (Orlando Jones), the school's band director, gives Devon a spot in the marching band's drumline, the heart and soul of a show-style band, but discovers Devon's previous musical education hardly meets his usual standard when he learns that his new drummer can't read music. Devon soon earns a reputation as a stubborn individualist within the band, not necessarily a good thing in an ensemble where a strictly unified performance is considers the ideal. Devon's cocksure attitude and streetwise style doesn't mesh very comfortably with Sean Taylor (Leonard Roberts), a disciplined senior who resents the presence of the upstart freshman in the drumline, and things become even less harmonious when Devon begins making a play for Laila (Zoe Saldana), a beautiful girl who is also being courted by Sean. Songwriter and record producer Dallas Austin, who has worked with Boyz II Men, TLC, and Pink, served as executive producer for Drumline, helped produce the film's musical score, and contributed his own experiences as a marching band member to the screenplay(n)</desc>

When top airplane engineer Ted Crawford discovers that his wife has been cheating on him he takes a devastatingly direct route to revenge: he drives home and shoots his errant spouse in the face. He then waits for the police to turn up and confesses to the crime. With his wife in a coma, Crawford is arrested and enters the justice system. It should, of course, be the simplest prosecution ever. And lawyer Willy Beachum can be forgiven for thinking that his last case as a criminal attorney (before he switches to company law) will be a doddle. However, once in court, Crawford, representing himself, proceeds to tear apart the ample evidence that's stacked against him. Can he possibly get away with his crime?(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Carlito's Way</title>
    <desc lang="en">Carlito's Way is a tale of a former hood trying to escape his former life. Al Pacino is Carlito Brigante, a high-level Puerto Rican drug dealer sprung from a three-decade jail sentence after only five years, thanks to a technicality and his sleazy, cocaine-addled lawyer, Dave Kleinfeld (Sean Penn). Carlito renounces his previous ways and takes a job as the manager of a club that Kleinfeld has invested in, planning to save enough money so that he can eventually move to the Caribbean. But no sooner is Carlito back on the streets of New York than his old life claws at him in the form of both old partners (Luis Guzman) and vicious up-and-comers (John Leguizamo). Nevertheless, Carlito stays clean and even restarts his relationship with a dancer named Gail (Penelope Ann Miller), until he is finally led astray by Kleinfeld, who manipulates Carlito into participating in the murder of a Mafia don from whom Kleinfeld has stolen a million dollars. At that point, the race is on to see whether Carlito and Gail can escape his world for good. The film is based on two novels about Carlito written by New York State judge Edwin Torres(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Drumline</title>
    <desc lang="en">After decades of movies about college sports, the bands who take the field at halftime finally get their day in the sun in this musical comedy drama. Devon Miles (Nick Cannon) is a talented young percussionist from Harlem who wins a music scholarship to Atlanta A &amp; T, a prestigious African-American university. For years, Atlanta A &amp; T has won awards for their show-style marching band, who combine expert musicianship (incorporating funk, R&amp;B, and jazz rhythms into the traditional marching band repertoire) with choreography, dancing cheerleaders, and roof-raising showmanship. Dr. Aaron Lee (Orlando Jones), the school's band director, gives Devon a spot in the marching band's drumline, the heart and soul of a show-style band, but discovers Devon's previous musical education hardly meets his usual standard when he learns that his new drummer can't read music. Devon soon earns a reputation as a stubborn individualist within the band, not necessarily a good thing in an ensemble where a strictly unified performance is considers the ideal. Devon's cocksure attitude and streetwise style doesn't mesh very comfortably with Sean Taylor (Leonard Roberts), a disciplined senior who resents the presence of the upstart freshman in the drumline, and things become even less harmonious when Devon begins making a play for Laila (Zoe Saldana), a beautiful girl who is also being courted by Sean. Songwriter and record producer Dallas Austin, who has worked with Boyz II Men, TLC, and Pink, served as executive producer for Drumline, helped produce the film's musical score, and contributed his own experiences as a marching band member to the screenplay(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In desperate need of a vacation after being unceremoniously dumped by his TV-star girlfriend, a man travels to a lavish Hawaiian resort to nurse his wounds and forget his heartache, only to discover that his ex and her handsome new boyfriend are currently staying at the exact same island hot spot. Peter Bretter (Jason Segel) may be just another struggling musician, but for the past six years he's been dating Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell), one of the hottest stars on television. Sarah is everything in the world to Peter, so when she kindly but firmly tells him that they should each go their separate ways, he is absolutely devastated. Later, after attempting to salvage his ego by awkwardly attempting to become a womanizer and nearly losing his job because of a nervous breakdown, an emotionally fragile Peter attempts to put the past behind him by escaping to the sun-soaked beaches of Oahu. While at first it seems as if Peter has discovered the perfect prescription for a bad case of lost love, his plan soon turns to dust when Sarah and her new rock-star boyfriend, Aldous (Russell Brand), turn up at the exact same resort. Though accepting Sarah's lavish new lifestyle won't be easy for the crestfallen Peter, the laid-back companionship of flirtatious resort employee Rachel (Mila Kunis) -- not to mention a continuous regimen of fruity cocktails -- goes a long way in mending the wounds of a broken heart. Forgetting Sarah Marshall was penned by Segel and produced by Judd Apatow. Fun with Dick and Jane screenwriter Nicholas Stoller makes his directorial debut. The cast also includes Paul Rudd, Bill Hader, Jack McBrayer, and Jonah Hill(n)</desc>

Mitch (Luke Wilson) returns home from a less-than-pleasant business trip one evening to discover his wife, Heidi (Juliette Lewis), involved in a ménage à trois with two blindfolded strangers. Feeling less than welcome at home after this, Mitch rents a house near the campus of a nearby college; two of Mitch's old college buddies, Beanie (Vince Vaughn) and Frank (Will Ferrell), stop by to cheer him up. They soon become regular guests at Mitch's place, despite the fact that Frank only recently wed Marissa (Perrey Reeves), while Beanie and his wife, Lara (Leah Remini), are busy with two kids. Beanie decides to throw a housewarming party for Mitch, and since Beanie sells audio equipment for a living, he's able to trick out the big bash with a massive PA system and an appearance by Snoop Dogg. Mitch soon finds he's the not-entirely-willing proprietor of the school's leading party spot, which raises the ire of Pritchard (Jeremy Piven), a dean at the college who was the target of Mitch, Frank, and Beanie's abuse when they were all students. Pritchard arranges to have Mitch's neighborhood zoned into a student housing district, but Beanie and Frank respond by forming a fraternity and making Mitch's home their headquarters. Mitch, however, is not enthusiastic about the idea, especially as he's trying to impress Nicole (Ellen Pompeo), a beautiful divorcee who is less than enchanted with Frank and Beanie's "party hearty" lifestyle. Old School director Todd Phillips knows more than a bit about the seamy side of fraternity life as director of the infamous unreleased documentary Frat House(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Academy Award winner Clint Eastwood directs Sean Penn and Tim Robbins in Oscar-winning performances in this tale of a seemingly senseless murder ... and how the tragedy reawakens the buried trauma of a long-ago crime. In Boston 25 years ago, 11-year-old Dave Boyle unwittingly gets into a car with two strangers. When he returns four days later, Dave is different in a way that destroys his friendship with Sean Devine and Jimmy Marcus. Now Sean's (Kevin Bacon) a cop, Jimmy's (Sean Penn) a neighborhood store owner with a prison record and mob connections, and Dave's (Tim Robbins) trying hard to keep his demons safely submerged. But when Jimmy's daughter is murdered, each of the men must confront a past that none wants to acknowledge. As the investigation tightens around these three, an ominous story unfolds--of friendship, family and innocence lost too soon(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Ark of the Covenant, the sacred container housing the stone tablets on which Moses inscribed the Ten Commandments, has inspired intrepid quests since it disappeared over 2,500 years ago. Hollywood's Indiana Jones grappled with Nazis to capture the Ark, which is believed to possess incredible destructive powers. And for the last 20 years a real-life adventurer, Professor Tudor Parfitt, has been searching for the last resting place of the Ark. Inspired by ancient documents and codes in Oxford and Jerusalem, the quest has taken Parfitt, a Professor of Modern Jewish Studies at London's prestigious School of Oriental and African Studies, on an incredible journey across the Middle East, Arabia and Africa. And now, controversially, he believes he can finally answer the riddle of the Ark and reveal its location. But the Professor is overwhelmed when he finally comes face-to-face with the ancient artefact that he believes to be the Ark, in the last place he expects to find it and looked after by people who have no idea of the significance of their possession. His theory is built upon incredible DNA research that reveals a lost tribe of Israel, and his research asks major question about what the Ark really was(n)</desc>

Harrison Ford, returning to the Ryan role after his first go-round in 1992's Patriot Games, is assigned to a delicate anti-drug investigation after a close friend of the President (a Reaganesque Donald Moffat) is murdered by a Colombian drug cartel. When Ryan discovers that the President's wealthy friend was in league with the cartel, the President's devious national security adviser (Harris Yulin) and an ambitious CIA deputy director (Henry Czerny) send a secret paramilitary force into Colombia to wipe out the drug lords. The force is captured and then abandoned by the President's lackeys. It falls to Ryan to enter Colombia and rescue them, aided only by a renegade operative named Clark (Willem Dafoe), with both his life and career on the line(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Germany v England.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Germany v England (Kick-off 7.45pm). Mark Pougatch presents coverage of the friendly international at Signal Iduna Park in Dortmund, where England continue their World Cup preparations. Gareth Southgate's men face Lithuania in a qualifier on Sunday as they look to cement their place at the top of Group F, while Germany travel to play Azerbaijan on the same day. The nations last met at this time last year in Berlin, when England staged a remarkable comeback having fallen 2-0 behind, only for goals by Harry Kane, Jamie Vardy and Eric Dier to seal a famous victory. With analysis from Lee Dixon, Ian Wright and Ryan Giggs, and commentary by Clive Tyldesley and Glenn Hoddle.(n)</desc>

The important plot points: Ross' son, Ben, is "misplaced" on a bus by the errant Chandler (Matthew Perry) and Joey (Matt LeBlanc). Ross (David Schwimmer) has a disturbing reaction to Monica's (Courteney Cox) kiwi-lime pie. And Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) doesn't get to sing at the Central Perk tonight -- but she does get to perform anyway. The DVD version of this episode includes material not seen in the syndicated version(n)</desc>

He then lived in Nazi-occupied Paris, where he entertained German officers and socialised with dancing girls, before an interrogation by the Gestapo forced him to move on again, but a betrayal meant he was sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau and then on to Bergen-Belsen.(n)</desc>

Though the gruff but lovable health inspector soon loses his job as a direct result of his questionable manners, he soon wins the heart of a shy waitress while attempting to go undercover to crack the case and ensure that the conspirators who engineered the poisonous plan are brought to justice(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Zombie Honeymoon</title>
    <desc lang="en">A young bride says "until death do us part," but finds that doesn't necessarily put an end to her romance in this offbeat blend of horror, comedy, and romance. Danny (Graham Sibley) and Denise (Tracy Coogan) are a young couple who have just gotten married and head off to a beachside bungalow to celebrate their honeymoon. While enjoying a sunny afternoon on the beach, Danny and Denise's idyllic getaway takes a turn for the worse when a monster rises from the ocean and attacks Danny. The creature spews poison into Danny's mouth, and soon the new husband is dead. But Danny isn't gone for long -- he unexpectedly regains consciousness, but Denise soon learns that her new mate has become a flesh-eating zombie, and that the former vegetarian now has a taste for human beings. But Danny still has one link with the world of the living -- he loves Denise with all his heart, and struggles to keep his monstrous appetites under control for her sake, while Denise remains deeply in love with Danny, and tries to adjust to the strange and monstrous changes taking place in the man she married. Zombie Honeymoon was written and directed by Dave Gebroe, who was inspired to make the film by his sister, a horror film fan who lost her husband in a surfing accident not long after they were wed(n)</desc>

Van Wilder's former assistant has learned the ways of the master, and now he's prepared to share his newfound knowledge with the stuffy students of the school known more for academia than rowdy mischief. Of course, by now Taj (Penn) knows that where there's a will there's a way, and there are plenty of fun-loving misfits at this esteemed institute of higher learning who are just looking for an excuse to ditch their studies and blow off a little steam by embracing their inner Van Wilder(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Bank Job</title>
    <desc lang="en">Jason Statham and Saffron Burrows star in director Roger Donaldson's cinematic account of the true-life 1971 London bank robbery that baffled the authorities and fascinated the public. Terry Leather (Statham) was a small-time car dealer who was trying to leave his shady past behind and start a family. Though he'd never been involved in any major crimes, he wasn't exactly on the straight and narrow his whole life either. Martine Love (Burrows) is a beautiful model from Terry's old neighborhood who knows that her former neighbor is no angel. When Martine proposes a foolproof plan to rob a Baker Street bank, Terry recognizes the danger but realizes this may be the opportunity of a lifetime. As the operation gets underway, the resourceful band of thieves burrows its way into a safe-deposit vault at the Lloyds Bank in Marylebone, quickly hitting a literal treasure trove of cash and priceless gems. But while the crew did know that the safe-deposit boxes contained millions in riches, they didn't realize that they also contained secrets that implicated everyone from London's most notorious underworld gangsters to powerful government figures, and even the Royal Family. Though the crime would make headlines all across Britain for several days after the fact, a government gag order eventually brought all reporting on the case to an immediate halt. Could it be that the most notorious bank robbers in recent memory were actually the most innocent people involved in this scandalous crime?(n)</desc>

Their lives are methodically being destroyed by a stranger who repeatedly delivers them terrifying videotapes containing disturbingly intimate views of their lives. This creates rapidly escalating tension that culminates in the murder of Renee and the subsequent incarceration of Fred who waits on Death Row in a dingy little cell. While awaiting his fate, Fred is tortured by terrifying visions. With neither warning, nor explanation, Fred is suddenly replaced by 18-year-old Pete (Balthazar Getty). As Pete committed no crime, the guards have no choice but to free him. The boy quickly returns to his job as an auto mechanic at the garage owned by wheelchair-bound Arnie. Pete moonlights by working with Mr. Eddy, a local gangster. Trouble begins when Pete falls for Eddy's blonde-bombshell moll Alice Wakefield (also played by Arquette).

    <title lang="en">No Country for Old Men</title>
    <desc lang="en">(2007) Ethan and Joel Coen's Oscar-laden thriller stars Josh Brolin as Llewelyn Moss, a trailer-dwelling welder and hunter. Hunting deer in the desert, he comes across a drugs exchange which has gone bloodily wrong, and among the detritus is a case containing $2m. He decides to appropriate the money, but it's not a wise move: he soon has the deadly assassin Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) on his trail, as well as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), and smiling bounty hunter Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson). As Moss tries to keep hold of the cash, and preserve both his own life and that of his wife Carla (Kelly Macdonald), a deadly game of cat-and-mouse is played out across the Tex-Mex border, as pursuers and the pursued try to gain the upper hand. In English, and Spanish with English subtitles. M,W,S(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The many emotional scars left by South Africa's history of institutionalized racism come under the microscope in this drama. As South Africa comes to terms with the legacy of apartheid, their government has created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, in which the perpetrators of racial violence and injustice must come face to face with their victims if they are to be forgiven for their crimes. Langston Whitfield (Samuel L. Jackson) is an African-American journalist who is assigned to cover these hearings by The Washington Post; Whitfield doubts the efficacy of this process, and sets out to interview Col. De Jager (Brendan Gleeson), a notorious former officer of the South African police who was famous for his violence against blacks in order to put this method to the test. While in South Africa, Whitfield meets Anna Malan (Juliette Binoche), an Afrikaner poet who is covering the hearing for a radio station and is both appalled and disturbed by the details of the violence inflicted against her countrymen. After striking up a friendship, Whitfield and Malan become romantically involved as they try to come to terms with their feelings about what they've learned. Also screened under the title Country of My Skull, In My Country was adapted from a book by South African author Antjie Krog(n)</desc>

Quentin, the oldest child, goes to Harvard, but he's very close with Caddy, the only daughter in the family who has a child out of wedlock. Second son Jason attempts to rule the family with an iron fist, but he's full of resentment towards Caddy's bastard child. All of them attempt to care for the developmentally disabled Benjy (Franco). Franco employs a fractured approach to the narrative in an attempt to capture Faulkner's distinctive prose style.

She thinks she may have found the right guy in Jim Winston (Freddie Prinze Jr.), but she has reason to believe that he might be guilty of murder. Since she's not sure he has actually done anything, she decides to find out the truth, and her investigation has unexpectedly comic consequences. Head Over Heels was directed by Mark S.

    <title lang="en">Excess Baggage</title>
    <desc lang="en">This first production from Alicia Silverstone's own company is a quirky comedy in which neglected teenage heiress Emily and unwilling kidnapper Vincent hit the road in a cross-country escapade. Emily attempts to fake her own kidnapping, tying and locking herself in a car boot, in a desperate cry for attention, but her plans go awry when she is accidentally driven away by Victor, a laconic car thief. When Victor discovers the girl, he hits the road with her, but soon it is hard to tell who is the kidnapper and who the victim, as the troublesome Emily vents her annoyance on her new-found companion. However, as the mis-matched pair are chased across the country by creepy friend of the family Ray , their icy disdain for one another begins to melt into something much deeper(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Ever After</title>
    <desc lang="en">Andy Tennant's romantic comedy fantasy is set in 16th-century France, where, following the death of her father, Danielle De Barbarac is assigned kitchen duties in the castle by her stepmother Baroness Rodmilla de Ghent. A chance meeting with Prince Henry, heir apparent to the throne, leads to the potential for a romance that she fears could be ruined if he discovers a masquerade. A 'fairy-godmother' in the shape of Leonardo da Vinci eventually smoothes the path of true love but thanks to Barrymore, this is not another soft retelling of Cinderella but a punchy, energetic film with Barrymore in excellent form as the forthright Danielle. Edited for language and mild violence(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In this Dogma 95-inspired first feature for acclaimed performers Jennifer Jason Leigh and Alan Cumming, the two star as Joe and Sally Therrian, a couple who have recently reconciled after a yearlong separation, and who decide to throw a sixth anniversary party in their honor. They invite a bevy of Hollywood types, including Skye Davidson (Gwyneth Paltrow), a young, beautiful, Ecstasy-pushing actress appointed to play a character based on Sally in the new feature film based on Joe's successful novel. Also featured are Cal and Sophia Gold (played by real-life marrieds Kevin Kline and Phoebe Cates), the former a co-star of Sally's and the latter her best friend who has given up the business to raise a family; Mac (John C. Reilly), the director of the new film and his actress wife Clair (Jane Adams), who has continued working after the recent birth of their child; Judy and Jerry Adams (Parker Posey and John Benjamin Hickey), the Therrians' managers; and Gina (Jennifer Beals), Joe's ex-girlfriend, who is often regarded as his first big love. Things are complicated when their contentious neighbors (Mina Badie and Denis O'Hare) make an appearance, and a mystery gift causes the event to unravel over the course of one long evening. The film was also written by Cumming and Leigh, another first for both actors(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Deliver Us From Eva</title>
    <desc lang="en">Three men discover that meddling in their sister-in-law's love life only makes their own lives more complicated in this romantic comedy. Eva Dandridge (Gabrielle Union) developed a sense of responsibility early on in life, when after the death of her parents she was left to care for her three younger sisters, Kareenah (Essence Atkins), Bethany (Robinne Lee), and Jacqui (Meagan Good). All four of the Dandridge sisters have grown up to be attractive, intelligent, and successful; Kareenah is happily married to Tim (Mel Jackson), while Bethany is engaged to Michael (Duane Martin), and Jacqui is going steady with Darrell (Dartanyan Edmonds). However, Eva still watches over her siblings like a hawk, and while her sisters love Eva dearly, Tim, Michael, and Darrell wish their sister-in-law would stay out of their business. The guys decide that if Eva had a boyfriend, she might be less interested in running other people's lives, and they turn to Ray (LL Cool J), a notorious ladies' man, for help. Ray is short on cash, so the guys make him a deal -- they'll give him 5,000 dollars to romance Eva, sweep her off her feet, and then dump her a few weeks later. Ray agrees, and while getting past her no-nonsense demeanor takes some doing, before long she's head over heels for him. However, Ray unexpectedly finds himself falling in love with Eva, and Eva, when offered a job in another town, decides to stay on to be with Ray. Even worse, the other Dandridge sisters are so impressed with the romantic Ray that they start demanding a bit more TLC from their own men(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Caveman's Valentine</title>
    <desc lang="en">A man struggles back from madness to avenge the death of someone he knew in an intelligent thriller based on the acclaimed novel by George Dawes Green. Romulus Ledbetter (Samuel L. Jackson) once had a career as an acclaimed concert pianist, a position at the Juilliard School of Music, and a loving wife and children. But Ledbetter's life has been devastated by paranoid schizophrenia; now homeless, Ledbetter wanders the streets of New York City as he rails against Cornelius Gould Stuyvesant, a man whom he believes controls all the evil in the world while following his movements from a perch atop the Chrysler Building. Most nights, Ledbetter takes shelter in a cave in Central Park, earning him the nickname "the Caveman." One morning, Ledbetter discovers a frozen corpse caught in the branches of a tree near his cave; the body is that of Scotty (Sean MacMahaon), a homeless drug addict who was close friends with his pal Matthew (Rodney Eastman). Ledbetter is determined to get justice for Scotty, and he's also eager to prove himself to his daughter Lulu (Aunjanue Ellis), now a New York City police officer. While Ledbetter is at first convinced that his nemesis Stuyvesant is responsible for Scotty's death, in time he focuses on another suspect: David Leppenraub (Colm Feore), a famous photographer known for his controversial erotic images of young men, who occasionally hired Scotty as a model. As Ledbetter attempts to investigate Leppenraub's possible role in the murder, he soon gains an unexpected ally -- Moira (Ann Magnuson), a noted sculptor and Leppenraub's sister. The Caveman's Valentine marked the major-studio debut for director Kasi Lemmons, who made an impressive debut in 1997 with the independent drama Eve's Bayou(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Jonathan Silverman, Oscar Nunez, Cesar Millan, Rhea Perlman, and Eddie Griffin headline this installment of the popular film series featuring everyone's favorite fun-loving St. Bernard. Animal handler Eddie (Silverman) may deal with some of the best beasts in the business by day, but when it comes to his personal life there are no pets allowed. So strict is Eddie in enforcing this policy that when his young son Billy discovers a stray dog named Beethoven and his young litter of puppies, he insists that the boy find another place for the homeless pooches to live. But when dog-nappers make off with the canine star of the latest film that Eddie is working on, producers start to turn up the pressure for Eddie to find a replacement. Now, the harried father's only hope is to replace the missing canine with Beethoven, a natural star if there ever was one. Of course it doesn't take long for Beethoven to win Eddie's heart, and take Hollywood by storm, in the process proving that you can teach an old dog new tricks after all(n)</desc>

Thus it is that Peter and Stewie make a mutually uncomfortable effort to bond. . .and it's a frightening thing to see. On the other hand, some viewers might get a case of the creeps while watching the episode's subplot, in which Stewie's slacker brother Chris becomes friends with Herbert, one of the weirdest of Family Guy's many peripheral characters.
