After huge delays and eye-watering legal costs, the couple have finally built the two-storey extension that was the key to creating a family home with character. George sees how the industrial heritage of this unique building is beautifully complemented by a 21st-century glass and sheet-metal extension that finally realises the old water tower's hidden potential.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly making a film about conjoined twins sounds like a recipe for stomach-churning grossness, but Stuck on You gets its laughs from others, not the twins. Bo and Walt run a diner in Martha's Vineyard, but Walt yearns for Hollywood stardom. Bo agrees to humour him and they hit LA, where Walt lands a part in a TV series starring Cher (herself): the shy Bo has to be hidden by scenery or "brushed out" from the scene. But Bo harbours a love for LA-based May (Wen Yann Shih), their romance previously conducted on-line, while Walt falls for April (Eva Mendes), an understanding pool babe. Can the disparate pair find love, success and happiness? With cameos from Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Dragonfly</title>
    <desc lang="en">Joe Darrow works as a doctor in the emergency room of Chicago Memorial Hospital. His wife, Emily Darrow, was last seen in a rainstorm in Venezuela, where she was on a retreat with the Red Cross offering humanitarian aid. She vanished in a bus accident. There were no survivors and her body was never found. That rich, green, exotic land is left behind as Joe is challenged to persevere through sad, rainy days back home. Joe promised Emily that if anything ever happened to her, he would visit her patients in the oncology ward. Strangely, the children seem to know him, and they say they've seen Emily in their near-death experiences. Joe starts to believe that his wife is using the near-death experiences of her terminal patients to communicate with him, through images the children report seeing in their dreams, and symbols they are inexplicably compelled to draw. While the children see Joe as a kindred spirit, the hospital staff worries about how these interactions are agitating them. At home, Joe begins finding other ethereal evidence of his wife's attempt to contact him from beyond the grave, some of it featuring the image of a dragonfly, which was the shape of the birthmark on her shoulder. His friends and a caring neighbor (Kathy Bates) worry that Joe is losing his marbles, especially as his quest becomes more frantic, putting his job in jeopardy(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Directed by Mike Newell, the fourth installment to the Harry Potter series finds Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) wondering why his legendary scar -- the famous result of a death curse gone wrong -- is aching in pain, and perhaps even causing mysterious visions. Before he can think too much about it, however, Harry boards the train to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he will attend his fourth year of magical education. Shortly after his reunion with his best friends, Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson), Harry is introduced to yet another Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher: the grizzled Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson), a former dark wizard catcher who agreed to take on the infamous "DADA" professorship as a personal favor to Headmaster Dumbledore (Michael Gambon). Of course, Harry's wishes for an uneventful school year are almost immediately shattered when he is unexpectedly chosen, along with fellow student Cedric Diggory (Robert Pattinson), as Hogwarts' representative in the Tri-Wizard Tournament, which awards whoever completes three magical tasks the most skillfully with a thousand-galleon purse and the admiration of the international wizard community. As difficult as it is to deal with his schoolwork, friendships, and the tournament at the same time (not to mention his feelings toward the ever unfathomable Professor Snape (Alan Rickman), Harry doesn't realize that the most feared wizard in the world, Lord Voldemort, is anticipating the tournament, as well(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Summer of Love: How Hippies Changed the World</title>
    <desc lang="en">The first of a two-part documentary recounting the 1967 coming-together that would change the world. The film traces the roots of the hippies to a 19th-century German sect of wandering naturalists that brought its freethinking ideas to California after the Second World War. There it merged with people expressing an interest in Eastern mystical concepts of human nature expounded by thinkers like Aleister Crowley and Aldous Huxley. Added to the mix was the CIA-developed drug LSD and a wave of student activists and anti-war protestors. The outcome was San Francisco's Summer of Love.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Sgt Pepper's Musical Revolution - with Howard Goodall</title>
    <desc lang="en">The composer explores why the Beatles' 50-year-old album is still revered as an innovative, revolutionary and influential release. With the help of out-takes, studio conversations between the band and never-heard-before outside of Abbey Road, Howard gets `under the bonnet' of the album, taking the music apart and reassembling it to reveal how it works. Producer George Martin and his team constructed the album sound by sound, layer by layer - a formula that became the norm for just about every rock act who followed.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Elton John, Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard, Alabama Shakes, Jack White, Nas, Ana Gabriel, Beck, Los Lobos and Steve Martin are among the modern artists who test their skills against the demands of the recording machine that literally made American music. There are no edits, no overdubs, and no retakes, and the disc only allows for three minutes of recording time. Despite these limitations, today's recordings for American Epic have one advantage - the freshly recorded sound is crystal clear and of an astonishing depth, transporting listeners vividly into the past - and the future. Narrated by Robert Redford. Last in the series.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A ragtag group of juvenile delinquents assigned the task of cleaning up an abandoned hotel find out just how deadly community service can be when they are stalked by a monstrous, four-hundred-pound maniac with a grudge in director Gregory Dark's wrestling-infused survival horror flick. It was a mere four years ago that seven-foot menace Jacob Goodnight (WWE superstar Kane) was shot in the head and left for dead by a local police officer. But Jacob wasn't going down that easy. With a steel plate subsequently attached to his skull and ten razor-sharp fingernails ready to scrape grey matter from the skulls of his victims, Jacob retreated to the abandoned Blackwell Hotel, where he resided in the darkened, rotting hallways while planning his ultimate revenge. As fate would have it, Jacob wouldn't have to go far to satiate his raging bloodlust, though, and as the unsuspecting teens make their way through the crumbling corridors of the once-luxurious inn guided by the very same policeman who fired that misguided bullet years earlier, the notorious killer sharpens his nails, stalks his prey, and prepares for a little payback(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">An adopted girl returns to her homeland of Russia to explore the dilapidated mountain farm she has recently inherited, only to discover that it harbors a deadly secret in the feature debut from Aftermath director Nacho Cerdà. Shortly after the mysterious death of her birth mother, young Marie was adopted and brought to live in the United States. When Marie receives word that she has inherited an isolated farm in her native Russia, she soon sets out to explore the vast estate and peel away the thick gauze obscuring her secret-shrouded past. Confounded by the local's refusal to show her to the "damned" locale and determined not to give up after coming this far, Marie convinces a man to take her there only to discover that he has inexplicably vanished shortly after arrival. As Marie sets out to explore the ominous and expansive property alone, a surprise encounter with a man named Boris, who claims to have been lured to the house under similar circumstances, sets into motion a chilling series of events in which the ghosts of the past -- as well as deceased doppelgangers of both Marie and Boris -- prevent the frightened pair from leaving. In the terrifying hours that follow, both of these tormented lost souls will find that sometimes the past is best left forgotten(n)</desc>

It was a mere four years ago that seven-foot menace Jacob Goodnight (WWE superstar Kane) was shot in the head and left for dead by a local police officer. But Jacob wasn't going down that easy. With a steel plate subsequently attached to his skull and ten razor-sharp fingernails ready to scrape grey matter from the skulls of his victims, Jacob retreated to the abandoned Blackwell Hotel, where he resided in the darkened, rotting hallways while planning his ultimate revenge. As fate would have it, Jacob wouldn't have to go far to satiate his raging bloodlust, though, and as the unsuspecting teens make their way through the crumbling corridors of the once-luxurious inn guided by the very same policeman who fired that misguided bullet years earlier, the notorious killer sharpens his nails, stalks his prey, and prepares for a little payback(n)</desc>

Shortly after the mysterious death of her birth mother, young Marie was adopted and brought to live in the United States. When Marie receives word that she has inherited an isolated farm in her native Russia, she soon sets out to explore the vast estate and peel away the thick gauze obscuring her secret-shrouded past. Confounded by the local's refusal to show her to the "damned" locale and determined not to give up after coming this far, Marie convinces a man to take her there only to discover that he has inexplicably vanished shortly after arrival. As Marie sets out to explore the ominous and expansive property alone, a surprise encounter with a man named Boris, who claims to have been lured to the house under similar circumstances, sets into motion a chilling series of events in which the ghosts of the past -- as well as deceased doppelgangers of both Marie and Boris -- prevent the frightened pair from leaving. In the terrifying hours that follow, both of these tormented lost souls will find that sometimes the past is best left forgotten(n)</desc>

For years, police have pursued the Genovese, but they remain frustratingly immune to arrest.

    <desc lang="en">Crime of Passion: The Pamela Smart Story. Youth, seduction, and violence populate the landscape of the A&amp;E program American Justice: Crimes of Passion -- The Pamela Smart Story. As an attractive motivated schoolteacher, Pam Smart was carving out a successful middle-class life. But, inwardly, she was passionately dissatisfied. Her husband held her back, yet she couldn't afford to live alone. Then, Smart met teenager Bill Flynn. He fell for her and she seemed flattered by the attention. Eventually, their relationship became intimate and Smart found the answer to all her problems. Through manipulation and claims of abuse, she convinced her young lover to kill her husband and that's just what he did with the help of two friends.

Youth, seduction, and violence populate the landscape of the A&amp;E program American Justice: Crimes of Passion -- The Pamela Smart Story. As an attractive motivated schoolteacher, Pam Smart was carving out a successful middle-class life. But, inwardly, she was passionately dissatisfied. Her husband held her back, yet she couldn't afford to live alone. Then, Smart met teenager Bill Flynn. He fell for her and she seemed flattered by the attention. Eventually, their relationship became intimate and Smart found the answer to all her problems. Through manipulation and claims of abuse, she convinced her young lover to kill her husband and that's just what he did with the help of two friends. But, Smart's calculating manner gave her away when police suspected her of being less than grief-stricken. What followed was the first live broadcast trial in history.

    <desc lang="en">In the second of two programmes about relationships in the wild, Liz Bonnin explores the ways in which animals get together. She observes a form of extreme flirting in a troop of capuchin monkeys in South America, which sees the females go to extraordinary lengths to attract the alpha male, reveals how African hyenas find it tough getting a girl and how an orang-utan in America chooses its partner in a very 21st-century way. For other animals, it turns out smell is a deal-breaker, while for others, it's all about having the best moves on the dance floor.(n)</desc>

Imagine the team's surprise when Charlotte betrays them to their nemesis, Col. Decker (Lance LeGault). When it turns out that Charlotte had done this because Decker had promised to catch her brother's murderer, the Team decides to ( a ) rescue Charlotte and solve the mystery themselves, and ( b ) play Decker for a sucker by staging a fake attack on a National Guard outpost, using little more than a record of movie sound effects. And as a bonus, Murdock (Dwight Schultz) imagines that he is a TV set, spewing out ersatz sitcoms!(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Reign Of Fire</title>
    <desc lang="en">Medieval fantasy meets futuristic science fiction in this effects-heavy action epic from former X-Files director Rob Bowman. In present-day London, 12-year-old Quinn Abercromby witnesses the awakening of a hibernating dragon from a centuries-long slumber, the result of a construction dig supervised by his mother and an incident for which Quinn feels partially responsible. Twenty years later, the adult Quinn (Christian Bale) is the fire chief of a refortified castle community, responsible for dousing the blazes lit by the dragon's prodigious number of flame-spewing offspring, airborne juggernauts that have wreaked havoc across the globe, torching civilization and turning humans into an endangered species. Hope arrives in the form of Denton "Dragon Slayer" Van Zan (Matthew McConaughey), an American known to be the only man to ever kill one of the dragons, and Alex (Izabella Scorupco), a scientist/pilot who's a member of Van Zan's army, a zealous fighting force that includes a secret weapon: the Archangels, paratroopers using themselves as bait to attract and then dispatch the deadly beasts.

    <title lang="en">I, Robot</title>
    <desc lang="en">(2004) Set just three decades into the future, Alex Proyas's all-action science-fiction film is inspired by Isaac Asimov's 1950s short story. The science of robotics is so advanced that humanoid-looking servants have been developed, ready to obey any command from a human. When the chief designer of US Robotics, the biggest manufacturer of this new brand, is found dead in the company's atrium after a fall from the upper floor, it has all the hallmarks of suicide, and Chicago cop Del Spooner (Will Smith) is assigned to the case. But technophobe Spooner doesn't believe that all robots are harmless. Despite opposition from both his superiors and the company, he investigates further and soon his suspicions centre on one robot, Sonny (voiced by Alan Tudyk). Is "he" one of an army of conscious, violent robots ready to challenge their human masters? ; HD Wide(n)</desc>

A trip to the Springfield Family Fun Center proves to be a lucky one for successful bully Nelson Muntz (voice of Nancy Cartwright) when he wins a brand new BB gun, and Bart Simpson (also voiced by Cartwright), suitably impressed, asks if he can come over some time and try it out. Bart's mother Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) is aware of Nelson's thuggish tendencies and doesn't care for guns, so she forbids Bart to spend time with Nelson. Bart stops by his house after school anyway, and while trying out the gun accidentally kills a bird. Marge arrives just in time to see Bart in action, and rather than yell at her boy, she tells him she's given up on him. Bart senses he's finally crossed a dangerous line, and when he sees several unhatched eggs in the late bird's nest, he takes the back to his tree house in order to hatch them. While Bart tries to keep the egg-hatching project a secret, when Marge finds out it gives her a new faith in her son. However, when the eggs finally hatch, to the surprise of everyone what emerges aren't birds but Bolivian Tree Lizards, which have been declared a menace to wildlife by the U.S. Wildlife Department. "Bart The Mother" featured a voice cameo from Phil Hartman as Troy McClure in what proved to be his final appearance on the show; the episode first aired on September 27, 1998(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">With the cake week completed, and one of their number already eliminated from the competition, the 11 remaining home bakers must now prove their skill at making biscuits, a task that can be deceptively difficult, and one that has undone many a confident Bake Off contestant in the past. The opening signature challenge this week is to create 24 biscotti, Italian delicacies that must be baked twice to deliver the perfect crisp crunch. Next is Paul Hollywood's technical challenge, in which the contestants tackle Arlettes - labour-intensive, puff pastry-based treats from southwest France. Finally, for the showstopper, the judges demand bespoke edible biscuit boxes, filled with 36 biscuits of different flavours. After all three rounds have concluded, it falls to Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins to announce which of the bakers will be asked to leave the tent.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Biscuits.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">With the cake week completed, and one of their number already eliminated from the competition, the 11 remaining home bakers must now prove their skill at making biscuits, a task that can be deceptively difficult, and one that has undone many a confident Bake Off contestant in the past. The opening signature challenge this week is to create 24 biscotti, Italian delicacies that must be baked twice to deliver the perfect crisp crunch. Next is Paul Hollywood's technical challenge, in which the contestants tackle Arlettes - labour-intensive, puff pastry-based treats from southwest France. Finally, for the showstopper, the judges demand bespoke edible biscuit boxes, filled with 36 biscuits of different flavours. After all three rounds have concluded, it falls to Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins to announce which of the bakers will be asked to leave the tent.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Eat Well for Less</title>
    <sub-title lang="en">The Guest Family.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The Guests from Loughborough eat a diet of convenience food that is not only unwholesome, it is also very expensive. Mum Lisa is aware she has to make her family more healthy, but is going about it the wrong way, buying into costly `superfoods' rather than good old-fashioned fruit and veg. Can Gregg and Chris help the Guests bring more variety to their plates - and in turn, knock a whopping 50 per cent off their shopping bill? Along the way, they also investigate how canned fish compares to fresh and which oil is best for cooking, as well as the diet cons to watch out for.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Great British Bake Off</title>
    <sub-title lang="en">Bread.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">The 10 remaining home-bakers must steel themselves to face the full force of Paul Hollywood's discerning eye as Bread week arrives. For the signature bake, the contestants are given an hour-and-a-half to prepare quick breads with no proving - which results in creative flavours such as sweet chocolate loaves and manchego and prosciutto-stuffed bread coming to the fore. Next up is the technical challenge, in which Paul lulls the bakers into a false sense of security by asking them to make baguettes, a relatively simple task that concludes with `the male judge' delivering one of his most brutal verdicts yet. Finally, a bicycle, a snake, a lion and even Brighton Pavilion find their way into the tent's ovens as the showstopper challenge sees the competitors crafting edible 3D bread sculptures.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">MasterChef: The Professionals</title>
    <desc lang="en">The first pair of semi-finalists are sent to Mayfair's Connaught Hotel to work a shift in the two Michelin-starred kitchen of French chef Helene Darroze, who then asks them to make her signature dish featuring calamari, blue lobster, clams, black squid ink, acquerello rice and Parmigiano-Reggiano foam. They then face a final test in which they must use what they have learned from their experience to cook a main course and a dessert for Marcus Wareing and Monica Galetti, who will pick one of them to go through to the last round of the contest.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Parenthood</title>
    <desc lang="en">This feel-good ensemble comedy tracks a quartet of suburban siblings and their families over the course of a single summer. Hardworking Gil Buckman (Steve Martin) and his stay-at-home wife, Karen (Mary Steeenburgen), have just a few months to help their oldest son, Kevin (Jasen Fisher), overcome his high-strung behavior problems before he'll be relegated to special-education classes. Gil's difficult relationship with his own father, Frank (Jason Robards), has led him to become a would-be super-dad for his three kids, so he takes his son's difficulties more than a little personally. Gil's sister, Helen (Dianne Wiest), is trying to raise a moody, adolescent son (Leaf Phoenix) and an independent-minded daughter (Martha Plimpton) with no help from her well-off ex-husband, who's more interested in his new wife and family. Gil and Helen's sister, Susan (Harley Jane Kozak), meanwhile, must participate in the too-scripted Big Life Plans of her anal-retentive husband, Nathan (Rick Moranis), whose overachiever zeal infects even their toddler daughter. When long-lost brother Larry (Tom Hulce) show up with yet another get-rich-quick scheme, he brings with him a surprise addition to the family. Screenwriters Babaloo Mandel, Lowell Ganz, and Ron Howard negotiate their varied subplots with a deftness and comedic touch that transforms this conflicted clan into a suburban everyfamily(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Parenthood</title>
    <desc lang="en">This feel-good ensemble comedy tracks a quartet of suburban siblings and their families over the course of a single summer. Hardworking Gil Buckman (Steve Martin) and his stay-at-home wife, Karen (Mary Steeenburgen), have just a few months to help their oldest son, Kevin (Jasen Fisher), overcome his high-strung behavior problems before he'll be relegated to special-education classes. Gil's difficult relationship with his own father, Frank (Jason Robards), has led him to become a would-be super-dad for his three kids, so he takes his son's difficulties more than a little personally. Gil's sister, Helen (Dianne Wiest), is trying to raise a moody, adolescent son (Leaf Phoenix) and an independent-minded daughter (Martha Plimpton) with no help from her well-off ex-husband, who's more interested in his new wife and family. Gil and Helen's sister, Susan (Harley Jane Kozak), meanwhile, must participate in the too-scripted Big Life Plans of her anal-retentive husband, Nathan (Rick Moranis), whose overachiever zeal infects even their toddler daughter. When long-lost brother Larry (Tom Hulce) show up with yet another get-rich-quick scheme, he brings with him a surprise addition to the family. Screenwriters Babaloo Mandel, Lowell Ganz, and Ron Howard negotiate their varied subplots with a deftness and comedic touch that transforms this conflicted clan into a suburban everyfamily(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Parenthood</title>
    <desc lang="en">This feel-good ensemble comedy tracks a quartet of suburban siblings and their families over the course of a single summer. Hardworking Gil Buckman (Steve Martin) and his stay-at-home wife, Karen (Mary Steeenburgen), have just a few months to help their oldest son, Kevin (Jasen Fisher), overcome his high-strung behavior problems before he'll be relegated to special-education classes. Gil's difficult relationship with his own father, Frank (Jason Robards), has led him to become a would-be super-dad for his three kids, so he takes his son's difficulties more than a little personally. Gil's sister, Helen (Dianne Wiest), is trying to raise a moody, adolescent son (Leaf Phoenix) and an independent-minded daughter (Martha Plimpton) with no help from her well-off ex-husband, who's more interested in his new wife and family. Gil and Helen's sister, Susan (Harley Jane Kozak), meanwhile, must participate in the too-scripted Big Life Plans of her anal-retentive husband, Nathan (Rick Moranis), whose overachiever zeal infects even their toddler daughter. When long-lost brother Larry (Tom Hulce) show up with yet another get-rich-quick scheme, he brings with him a surprise addition to the family. Screenwriters Babaloo Mandel, Lowell Ganz, and Ron Howard negotiate their varied subplots with a deftness and comedic touch that transforms this conflicted clan into a suburban everyfamily(n)</desc>

Satan (Harvey Keitel) is considering retirement, and is pondering which of his sons should take over the family business -- ambitious Adrian (Rhys Ifans), strapping Cassius (Tommy "Tiny" Lister Jr.), or Nicky (Adam Sandler), an accident-prone demon who prefers to stay in his room playing his favorite heavy metal tunes. When Satan decides to stay on for another 10,000 years, Adrian is outraged, and leaves Hell to go to New York, where he and Cassius attempt to round up enough souls to vote Satan out of power. Satan, understandably upset, sends Nicky to bring Adrian and Cassius back home, but Nicky finds life on Earth is more complicated than he expected. Things don't get any easier when he develops a crush on Valerie (Patricia Arquette), a good-hearted mortal woman. Little Nicky also features Michael McKean as a city official trying to put Nicky behind bars, Kevin Nealon as Hell's gatekeeper, Rodney Dangerfield as Satan's father, Robert Smigel as the voice of Beefy -- a talking dog who is Nicky's guide on earth, Allen Covert as Todd -- Nicky's new roommate, and Peter Dante and Jonathan Loughran as a pair of metalheads who dig Satan.

    <title lang="en">The Good Guy</title>
    <desc lang="en">After executive producing the acclaimed documentary Manda Bala and the J.M. Coetzee adaptation Disgrace, Julio DePietro makes his feature debut as a writer-director with The Good Guy, a drama about ambitious young Wall Streeters fighting each other -- and sometimes their own decent nature -- to get ahead in the world. Our narrator, Tommy (Scott Porter of TV's Friday Night Lights), is young, clever, charming, and attractive. He's got a smart, pretty girlfriend, Beth (Alexis Bledel of Gilmore Girls), an urban conservationist. He's also very good at his investment broker job, impressing his ruthless, cynical boss, Cash (erstwhile "Brat Pack" member Andrew McCarthy). When a key member of Tommy's sales team suddenly leaves for a competitor, Tommy needs to fill his spot quickly, and takes a chance on the bumbling Daniel (Bryan Greenberg, Bride Wars), a former Marine and computer geek who seems a bit naïve about high finance and a bit nervous around women. Tommy takes Daniel under his wing, showing him how to dress, where to socialize, and how to charm attractive women. Their relationship is threatened when Daniel begins spending more time with Beth, joining her book club, and becoming her confidant. Tommy begins to question his decision to share his wisdom with Daniel, while Daniel is forced to decide what success really means to him, and where his loyalties lie. The Good Guy also stars Anna Chlumsky (In the Loop) and Aaron Yoo (Disturbia). The film had its world premiere at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Mr. Monk Gets Jury Duty. Adrian Monk is a highly gifted detective whose career is jeopardised by his overwhelming fear of germs, crowds, small places, and almost everything else...(although he's making progress on milk). Monk's disorder was triggered by the murder of his beloved wife, Trudy, which continues to haunt him as the only unsolved mystery in his career. Ordered to take a leave of absence from the police department, Monk hires Sharona, a nurse who helps him try to get reinstated on the force, and in the process, becomes an unlikely Dr. Watson to his Sherlock Holmes. When the police department find themselves unable to crack a high-profile case, they have no choice but to bring back the only man for the job...phobias and all(n)</desc>

However, whereas Mark, Chris, Julian and Billy normally renovate an existing property, for the first time they are knocking down a building and reconstructing it from the ground up - making it worth almost £1million. With just nine days to complete the job, they'll need help - and lots of it.

    <desc lang="en">Alfre Woodard and Kathy Bates star in writer/director Tyler Perry's family drama about an upper-crust family and their working-class counterparts, who discover that scandal knows no social boundaries. Charlotte Cartwright (Bates) and Alice Pratt (Woodard) may be from different sides of the tracks, yet over the years they've managed to nurture a strong and healthy friendship. That friendship is put to the ultimate test, however, when their adult children begin to act out in ways that neither parent ever saw coming. Alice's daughter Andrea (Sanaa Lathan) is married to a trusting husband named Chris (Rockmond Dunbar), but lately she's been betraying that trust by sleeping with her boss, William (Cole Hauser), who just so happens to be Charlotte's son. William is married to Jillian (KaDee Strickland), and in addition to being unfaithful, he's also scheming to take over the role of COO at his mother's lucrative construction firm. Meanwhile, Alice's other daughter, Pam (Taraji P. Henson), and her husband, Ben (Perry), a faithful family man and construction worker, have both recognized that their family has strayed from the course of righteousness, and become determined to help their loved ones back on the right path. When paternity secrets, shady double dealings, and a series of other scandals become too much for Charlotte and Alice to take, the two women set out on a cross-country trip in order to clear their heads and devise a plan for saving their families(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Alfre Woodard and Kathy Bates star in writer/director Tyler Perry's family drama about an upper-crust family and their working-class counterparts, who discover that scandal knows no social boundaries. Charlotte Cartwright (Bates) and Alice Pratt (Woodard) may be from different sides of the tracks, yet over the years they've managed to nurture a strong and healthy friendship. That friendship is put to the ultimate test, however, when their adult children begin to act out in ways that neither parent ever saw coming. Alice's daughter Andrea (Sanaa Lathan) is married to a trusting husband named Chris (Rockmond Dunbar), but lately she's been betraying that trust by sleeping with her boss, William (Cole Hauser), who just so happens to be Charlotte's son. William is married to Jillian (KaDee Strickland), and in addition to being unfaithful, he's also scheming to take over the role of COO at his mother's lucrative construction firm. Meanwhile, Alice's other daughter, Pam (Taraji P. Henson), and her husband, Ben (Perry), a faithful family man and construction worker, have both recognized that their family has strayed from the course of righteousness, and become determined to help their loved ones back on the right path. When paternity secrets, shady double dealings, and a series of other scandals become too much for Charlotte and Alice to take, the two women set out on a cross-country trip in order to clear their heads and devise a plan for saving their families(n)</desc>

It's Halloween night, and four friends -- Allison (Vanessa Horneff), Elliott (Wil Horneff), Trevor (Karl Jacob), and Brian (Sean Reid) -- are on a road trip en route to a friend's wedding when their car breaks down after running into something. Looking for help, the four happen upon the farmhouse of an elderly couple, Elvin (Richard Little) and May (Barbara Wilhide), which is located next to a huge barn. Elvin and May have already become lost in the darkness of the barn, and soon two of the lost travelers are suffering the same fate as they search for friendly strangers. However, while they can barely see a hand in front of their face, they discover they're not alone in the barn, which has become home to a huge swarm of bloodthirsty bats. The Roost is framed by an introduction and postscript from a television horror show host, played by Tom Noonan(n)</desc>

In 1900's Vienna there's only one show in town - and that's the one featuring mesmeric entertainer Eisenheim. His magical abilities are wowing the crowds, with an act that ranges from mere tricks to an apparent capacity to raise the dead. However, he has also long been in love with Duchess Sophie von Teschen, a fact which puts him in dangerous competition with the violent, scheming Crown Prince Leopold. And, after Eisenheim uses one of his performances as an opportunity to humiliate the Crown Prince, Leopold jumps at the opportunity to have the magician arrested by Inspector Uhl on grounds of necromancy. It's only then, during Eisenheim's interrogation, that we learn the full story of his life and the political plot that he's stumbled upon..(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The 1981 mythological fantasy adventure Clash of the Titans is resurrected in this remake from Incredible Hulk director Louis Leterrier. Discovered at sea as an infant by a weary fisherman, demigod Perseus (Sam Worthington) grows up with no real knowledge of his celestial origins until his watchful guardian, Io (Gemma Arterton), informs him that he is the offspring of Zeus (Liam Neeson). When Zeus' brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes) casually wipes out Perseus' family, the grieving son vows to show the gods just what kind of damage humankind can inflict on its creators. Before long, Perseus and a small group of soldiers are venturing out into the desert in order to find a way to stop the Kraken, a terrifying force of nature that an indignant Hades has vowed to unleash upon man should they fail to offer up beloved princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) as a sacrifice. Along the way, the soldiers encounter a trio of frightening witches with second sight, contend with Hades' devoted servant Calibos (Jason Flemyng), battle giant scorpions, and come face to face with Medusa (Natalia Vodianova), the dreaded gorgon whose gaze has the power to turn men into stone(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Wet Hot American Summer</title>
    <desc lang="en">1980s teen comedies finally get the parody they so richly deserve with Wet Hot American Summer, the first feature film from writer/director David Wain and co-screenwriter Michael Showalter, formerly of the sketch comedy troupe the State. It's the last day of the summer season at Camp Firewood, and as camp director Beth (Janeane Garofalo) prepares to wrap things up, the staff of teenage counselors realize this is their last chance to do something about the summer romances that have been brewing for the past three months. Sweet but shy Coop (Michael Showalter) is crazy about pretty Katie (Marguerite Moreau), but there's the problem of her severely moody boyfriend Andy (Paul Rudd). Meanwhile, Victor (Ken Marino) is trying to score with sexy Abby (Marisa Ryan), who is known to make friends easily, and McKinley (Michael Ian Black) and Ben (Bradley Cooper) attempt to keep their hot and heavy relationship a secret. Meanwhile, arts and crafts teacher Gail (Molly Shannon) turns to her students for comfort as her marriage falls apart, drama coach Susie (Amy Poehler) tries to whip the talent show into shape with Ben's help, and camp chef Gene (Christopher Meloni) deals with his unique sexual quirks with the help of a talking can of vegetables (voiced by H. Jon Benjamin). Beth even finds time for romance with socially inept astrophysicist Henry (David Hyde Pierce), but first Henry has to save Camp Firewood from a large piece of space junk about to re-enter Earth's atmosphere. Like Wain and Showalter, Ken Marino, Michael Ian Black, and Joe Lo Truglio (who appears in a small role) were also members of the State; fellow State alumnus Kerri Kenney was cast in a supporting role in the film, but her character didn't appear in the final cut(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Fourteen-year-old Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan) is just experiencing the pangs of first love when she's viciously murdered by her neighbor Mr. Harvey (Stanley Tucci), a predatory wolf with a deceptively mundane appearance. As her family slowly begins drifting apart while struggling to make sense of their loss, Susie bravely attempts to find her footing in the hereafter. Meanwhile, down on earth, Mr. Harvey is feeling confident that he's covered his tracks well enough to get away with the crime, and begins honing in on his next victim -- Susie's younger sister, Lindsey (Rose McIver), who's beginning to suspect that he's not the harmless suburbanite he portrays himself to be. Director Peter Jackson reteams with King Kong and Lord of the Rings trilogy co-screenwriters Philippa Boyens and Fran Walsh to adapt Alice Sebold's bestselling novel for the big screen(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Annie Hall</title>
    <desc lang="en">Woody Allen's romantic comedy of the Me Decade follows the up and down relationship of two mismatched New York neurotics. Jewish comedy writer Alvy Singer (Allen) ponders the modern quest for love and his past romance with tightly-wound WASP singer Annie Hall (Diane Keaton, née Diane Hall). The twice-divorced Alvy knows that it's not easy to find a mate when the options include pretentious New York intellectuals and lifestyle-obsessed Rolling Stone writers, but la-di-dah-ing Annie seems different. Along the rocky road of their coupling, Allen/Alvy weigh in on such topics as endless therapy, movies vs. TV, the absurdity of dating rituals, anti-Semitism, drugs, and, in one of the best set pieces, repressed Midwestern WASP insanity vs. crazy Brooklyn Jewish boisterousness. Annie wants to move to Los Angeles to find that fame that finally does in the relationship -- but not before Alvy gets in a few digs at vacuous, mantra-fixated California. Originally entitled Anhedonia (the inability to enjoy oneself), Annie Hall blended the slapstick and fantasy from such earlier Allen films as Sleeper (1973) and Bananas (1971) with the more autobiographical musings of his stand-up and written comedy, using an array of such movie techniques as talking heads, splitscreens, and subtitles. Within these gleeful formal experiments and sight gags, Allen and co-writer Marshall Brickman skewered 1970s solipsism, reversing the happy marriage of opposites found in classic screwball comedies. Hailed as Allen's most mature and personal film, Annie Hall beat out Star Wars for Best Picture and also won Oscars for Allen as director and writer and for Keaton as Best Actress; audiences enthusiastically responded to Allen's take on contemporary love and turned Keaton's rumpled menswear into a fashion trend(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">A Good Woman</title>
    <desc lang="en">One of Oscar Wilde's most popular plays is given a new screen interpretation in this period comedy. In New York in the early '30s, Mrs. Erlynne (Helen Hunt) is a widow who lives comfortably through the largesse of several married men, and when she runs out of wealthy suitors in Manhattan, she decides to find greener pastures among the wealthy elite of Italy's Amalfi coast. Mrs. Erlynne sets her sights on Robert Windermere (Mark Umbers), a wealthy Englishman who is married to the young, innocent and very beautiful Meg (Scarlett Johansson). Mrs. Erlynne gingerly tries to separate Robert from his wife and his money, fueling suspicions within Amalfi society as well as the audience that they are involved. Humiliated and ready to beat him at his own game, Meg begins to consider the advances of the handsome Lord Darlington (Stephen Campbell Moore), one of her husband's close friends. In the midst of all the attempted infidelity, the genially eccentric Tuppy (Tom Wilkinson) struggles to win Mrs. Erlynne's hand, while only one of the interconnected parties know that she carries a shocking secret. A Good Woman was based on Wilde's +Lady Windermere's Fan, with its title drawn from that show's subtitle, "A Play About a Good Woman."(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Peter La Fleur owns Average Joe's Gym, a scruffy establishment with a loyal clientele, while across the street Globo Gym, owned by White Goodman, is all glass and chrome and full of toned muscle. When La Fleur learns that he must pay the bank $50,000 in 30 days, Goodman is overjoyed: he can acquire his rival's building, knock it down and have the car park his gym's always needed. But La Fleur decides to set up a money-earning dodgeball tournament (a sport that consists of not being hit by balls hurled by the opposing team). And, of course, La Fleur's team of misfits end up in a face-off against Goodman's tough pros in the final. Rawson Marshall Thurber's debut feature is a mix of verbal and physical humour, and, if the outcome is never in doubt, both Vaughn and Stiller throw themselves into the venture with enjoyable gusto(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Dark Girls</title>
    <desc lang="en">When Africans were first brought to the United States as slaves, many slave owners took a strange approach to diving the labor among the humans they owned -- lighter skinned blacks were assigned to work inside the house, performing more precise but less physically demanding chores, while their darker skinned brethren were forced to perform punishing manual labor in the fields. In the 21st Century, a grim vestige of this tradition lives on in African-American culture, as women with dark complexion often find themselves looked down upon by their peers, considered less attractive, less intelligent and less refined than women with a lighter skin tone. A variety of African-American women discuss this phenomenon, sharing their thoughts on the social and cultural implications of this subtle but common form of prejudice, in the documentary Dark Girls. Directors Bill Duke and D. Channsin Berry feature interviews with women sharing their own experiences as dark skinned African-Americans, children who reveal how young these beliefs are implanted in girls, and men who share their feelings about women and skin color. Dark Girls was an official selection at the 2011 Toronto Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Jerry Maguire</title>
    <desc lang="en">Taking a refreshing approach to an old story, this romantic comedy is one of those rare Hollywood features that contains a little something for almost everyone: sports, romance, humor, satire, a touch of pathos, insight and even some subtle drama. At the onset, Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) is a busy and highly successful manager of 72 noted sports personalities. Like most of Sports Management International's top employees, he is ruthlessly ambitious and greedy. He spends most of his time zooming across the country trying to figure out ways to promote his clients--not to help them, but to make money for his employer. But late one night in yet another faceless hotel, something inside Jerry snaps. Hastily, he pens a fiery letter titled "The Things We Think and Do Not Say: The Future of Our Business," a passionate call to start caring more for the clients than the revenue they generate. The memo nets Jerry a standing ovation from his peers, but his bosses are not impressed and soon afterward, Jerry gets canned. As he walks out, he asks others to join him, but only one lowly accountant, Dorothy(Renee Zellweger), dares show solidarity. For her, a widow with a small son, it is a strong sign of her quiet devotion to his cause. All of his clients but Rod Tidwell, the wide receiver for the Arizona Cardinals desert him. So does his equally ruthless fiance Avery Bishop. Still, Jerry is determined to reassemble his life and so begins wooing promising college draft pick Frank Cushman, a young quarterback with real star potential. He also begins looking carefully at Dorothy. She and her son live with her caustic older sister Laurel. Despite the obstacles presented by Laurel and her divorced friends, Dorothy and Jerry begin a tentative relationship that goes well until they reach a final obstacle, one that could have lasting consequences for her little boy(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Minus Man</title>
    <desc lang="en">Notable as the directorial debut of Blade Runner co-scripter Hampton Fancher, this darkly comic thriller stars affable Owen Wilson as Vann Siegert, a different brand of serial killer: one who actually believes he's doing his deeply depressed victims a service of mercy. Wandering up the West Coast, Vann chooses victims from a parade of colorful social misfits -- including a haggard junkie (singer Sheryl Crow) whose pain he ends with a nip from his flask of poison amaretto -- and expounds on his motives with a pocket tape recorder (a drawling monologue that serves as the film's narrative voice-over). A brief layover in Owensville eventually finds Vann in the company of quarreling middle-aged couple Doug and Jane (Brian Cox and Mercedes Ruehl), who grow fond of the young drifter's amiable demeanor and take him on as a boarder. After landing a job at the local post office, Vann catches the eye of co-worker Ferrin (Janeane Garofalo), and a tentative romance blossoms -- but even love can't distract Vann from his crusade to terminate people's unhappiness: "They come to me like moths, because I shine," he explains. Though not the complex psychological game it purports to be, The Minus Man is an intriguing character study -- imagine a kindler, gentler version of Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer -- with some clever twists and fine performances, including a touching portrayal from the usually acerbic Garofalo. Geared more to the art-movie crowd than to fans of Hitchcockian thrills, this film opened to raves at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Far From Home: The Adventures of Yellow Dog</title>
    <desc lang="en">In this family adventure story, John and Catherine McCormick (Bruce Davison and Mimi Rogers) relocate from Vancouver to the coast of British Columbia, where sailing enthusiast John teaches his sons Angus (Jesse Bradford) and Silas (Joel Palmer) basic seamanship and outdoor survival skills. Angus has rescued a stray Golden Labrador he calls Yellow and considers his best friend, though his folks aren't so sure he's responsible enough to care for the dog. One day, John takes Angus and Yellow sailing; a sudden gale bursts out, and the boy and his dog are thrown overboard. They wash up on a rugged coastal area, where Angus' abilities to survive in the wild are put to the test. As Angus and Yellow fend off wild animals, build a shelter, and signal for help, John and Catherine work with the Coast Guard in a desperate search for their missing son. Far from Home: The Adventures of Yellow Dog was the final film by Canadian director Phillip Borsos, who died of leukemia within a month of its U.S. release(n)</desc>

The scene is the magnificent but isolated home of scientist Dr. Loren (John Hoyt), his wife (Irene Tedrow), and their attractive young daughter Jana (Inger Stevens). To insulate himself from the world, Dr. Loren has created a household staff of robots, who cater to the Lorens' every whim. Eventually, Jana becomes fed up with her sheltered existence and demands that Dr. Loren dismantle all of his robots -- something which, for reasons made painfully clear in the episode's second act, he cannot bring himself to do. Written by Rod Serling, "The Lateness of the Hour" was the first of six Twilight Zone episodes to be shot on videotape, as part of an overall CBS economy drive. The episode originally aired December 2, 1960(n)</desc>
