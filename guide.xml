Four aging former mobsters -- Joey "Bats" Pistella (Burt Reynolds), Bobby Bartellemeo (Richard Dreyfuss), Mike the Brick (Dan Hedaya), and Tony "The Mouth" Donato (Seymour Cassel) -- live in the same rundown Miami apartment complex, the Raj Mahal. New owners hope to clear out the current tenants and replace them with a younger, more lucrative clientele. But the veteran gangsters don't want to move, so to scrape up the extra rent money, they take a job executing the father of a Miami mob boss. They happen to know he's already dead, so all they have to do is make it look like they did the hit. Their problems start when loudmouthed ladies' man Tony tells too much to Ferris (Jennifer Tilly), a stripper, and soon she's talked him into murdering her mother (Lainie Kazan) in exchange for her silence. The Crew also features Carrie-Anne Moss as a detective and Jeremy Piven as a mob kingpin out to avenge his father's death(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Conjuring</title>
    <desc lang="en">A demonic entity lays claim to family living in a secluded farmhouse, prompting them to seek the aid of two renowned paranormal researchers in this tale of possession inspired by actual events. The story gets underway as paranormal researchers Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) evaluate a mysterious doll discovered by a trio of young roommates in 1968. Believing their house to be haunted by the wayward spirit of a deceased young girl, they give the girl permission to inhabit the doll, and soon their lives become a waking nightmare. Informed by Ed and Lorraine that they have fallen victim to an inhuman spirit (aka a demon) seeking a human host, the roommates entrust the doll to the Warrens, who place it in their personal museum for safekeeping. Flash forward three years to Harrisville, RI, where the Perron family have just moved into their country dream home -- an 18th century farmhouse that offers plenty of space for parents Carolyn (Lili Taylor) and Roger (Ron Livingston), as well as their five daughters Andrea (Shanley Caswell), Nancy (Hayley McFarland), Christine (Joey King), Cindy (Mackenzie Foy), and April (Kyla Deaver). It seems like the ideal place to raise a family until a series of unsettling events leave the Perron family convinced they are not alone. Terrified, Carolyn reaches out to the Warrens for help, and learns that a demonic entity has attached itself to her family, and has no intentions of letting them go. Meanwhile, the deeper the Warrens delve into the farmhouse's history, the clearer it becomes that this spirit has a murderous agenda, and that no one will be safe until it is driven back into darkness(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This action drama puts a new spin on Shaft, one of the key "blaxploitation" films of the 1970s. John Shaft (Samuel L. Jackson), the namesake nephew of the legendary private eye (Richard Roundtree), is a street-smart police detective who with his partner Carmen Velez (Vanessa L. Williams) has been assigned to a racially motivated murder case, in which a black college student was killed in front of a restaurant by Walter Williams Jr. (Christian Bale), the sociopathic son of a New York construction tycoon, who then fled the country rather than face prosecution. Diane Palmieri (Toni Collette), a waitress on a smoke break, saw the murder, but she doesn't want to talk to the police. Two years later, Walter is forced to return to New York, but without Diane's testimony, the city doesn't have much of a case. Soon, Shaft, Walter Junior, and Walter Senior's goons are all looking for Diane, with Junior enlisting the help of Peoples Hernandez (Jeffrey Wright), a small-time drug dealer who will do anything to move into the big leagues. Shaft and Carmen find Diane, but discover that she had a good reason for being on the lam for the past two years. Amidst all this activity, John gets frequent advice from his uncle, with whom he ponders the idea of quitting the force and opening a detective agency. Shaft was directed by John Singleton, from a screenplay by Singleton, Richard Price, and Shane Salerno(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Negotiator</title>
    <desc lang="en">(1998) F Gary Gray's action-thriller starring Samuel L Jackson and Kevin Spacey. When police hostage negotiator Danny Roman (Jackson) unwittingly gets involved in a colleague's attempt to expose financial fraud within the force, he quickly finds himself in very deep water. With the colleague found shot dead, and the embezzlement being pinned on him, Roman snaps and takes a surprising course of action: he turns his police role on its head and - in an effort to buy himself time to prove his innocence - takes hostage a number of people in the Internal Affairs Department, including his chief accuser Terence Niebaum (JT Walsh). Roman's next step is to demand the presence of Chris Sabian (Spacey), a fellow hostage negotiator who works on the other side of the city, and so, Roman hopes, is unconnected with the plot to frame him. But can such a reckless strategy have any chance of paying off? Also starring David Morse, Siobhan Fallon and Paul Giamatti. M,W,R(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Negotiator</title>
    <desc lang="en">(1998) F Gary Gray's action-thriller starring Samuel L Jackson and Kevin Spacey. When police hostage negotiator Danny Roman (Jackson) unwittingly gets involved in a colleague's attempt to expose financial fraud within the force, he quickly finds himself in very deep water. With the colleague found shot dead, and the embezzlement being pinned on him, Roman snaps and takes a surprising course of action: he turns his police role on its head and - in an effort to buy himself time to prove his innocence - takes hostage a number of people in the Internal Affairs Department, including his chief accuser Terence Niebaum (JT Walsh). Roman's next step is to demand the presence of Chris Sabian (Spacey), a fellow hostage negotiator who works on the other side of the city, and so, Roman hopes, is unconnected with the plot to frame him. But can such a reckless strategy have any chance of paying off? Also starring David Morse, Siobhan Fallon and Paul Giamatti. M,W,R(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Notorious Metro City villian Megamind (voice of Will Ferrell) becomes an unlikely savior to the troubled metropolis after defeating beloved do-gooder Metro Man (voice of Brad Pitt) and creating a new opponent who refuses to play by the rules. Megamind was only an infant when his parents loaded him into an emergency escape pod and jettisoned him into space just as their planet was being sucked into a black hole. His destination: planet Earth. Meanwhile, another slightly more wholesome baby sets out on the same trajectory. But while the latter will ultimately land in the home of a wealthy couple and grow up to become Metro Man, hero of Metro City, poor Megamind finds his fate taking the opposite course when his pod crashes in a prison yard, leaving him to be raised by convicts. Later, in grade school, the kids all flock to Metro Man, leaving a frustrated Megamind to embrace a life of diabolical misdeeds. As the years go by, Metro Man and Megamind develop an intense adversarial relationship that pits them in battle over Metro City time and again. Undeterred by his unbroken losing streak, Megamind hatches an ingenious scheme to finally destroy Metro Man by kidnapping pretty reporter Roxanne Ritchi (voice of Tina Fey), and luring the predictable hero into a deadly trap. Then something unexpected happens -- Megamind's plan actually works. Now, with Metro Man out of the picture, Megamind and his Minion (voice of David Cross) stake their claim on Metro City. But what good is ultimate power when you don't even have to fight for it? Realizing that life is simply out of balance without Metro Man to be the hero, Megamind creates a new foe who will be just as righteous and powerful as his fallen adversary. Unfortunately, Megamind's schemes usually have a way of backfiring, and when Metro City's newest savior proves even more evil than Megamind, the blue-hued antihero prepares to fight back with everything he's got(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Margot Fonteyn inspired generations of ballerinas, while her late-flowering partnership with Rudolf Nureyev created the most dazzling ballet partnership in history. However, her life was marked by tragedy and disappointment. Darcey finds that Margot couldn't find love and never had children, got drawn into a failed foreign revolution, danced on for too long, and died in poverty. The former ballerina goes behind the scenes at the Royal Opera House and the Royal Ballet, and travels from London to New York and Panama, discovering that Margot did eventually find a kind of happiness - though one that came at a high price.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter is re-imagined as a contemporary high school comedy in this tale of a scheming student who plots to give her popularity a boost by painting herself the easiest lay in school. Like most high school kids, Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone) just wants to be popular. So much so than when her best friend, Rhiannon (Aly Michalka), asks Olive how her weekend went, the bored teen decides to whip up a spicy white lie just to make things interesting. But that minor exaggeration begins to take on a life of its own when it reaches the ears of motor-mouth gossip Jesus freak Marianne (Amanda Bynes), and in no time the entire student body is abuzz over unassuming Olive's unrepentant weekend of debauchery. Of course not a word of it is true, but that doesn't stop everyone in school from talking, and an amused Olive from deciding to go with the flow. Playing the role of the hussy to the hilt, the girl who used to be invisible begins dressing provocatively and turning heads in the hallways. The students aren't the only ones taking notice, either; Olive's English teacher, Mr. Griffith (Thomas Haden Church), is concerned that the kind of attention she's receiving isn't healthy for a developing girl, and his wife (Lisa Kudrow), the school guidance counselor, is in full agreement. The only people who seem remotely interested in the truth are Olive's trusting and open-minded parents (Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson). As Olive takes note of the parallels between her own situation and the plight of the Scarlet Letter heroine Hester Prynne, she realizes that she may be able to manipulate her newfound notoriety to give fellow classmate Brandon's (Dan Byrd) popularity a much-needed shot in the arm. Olive never thought her little game could possibly have any negative effect on anyone but herself, but when loose lips start sinking ships all around her, she realizes that it's high time for the truth to come out(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Britain's Biggest Armed Robbery.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">On a cold November morning in 1983, armed robbers targeted the Brinks Mat security depot at the Heathrow International Trading Estate. Following an extremely brutal military-style raid, the gang got away with over £26million of gold. The robbery - the country's biggest and most notorious - caused the price of gold to soar and sent ripples through the criminal underworld. This programme hears from police officers who followed the increasingly complex case, as it pieces together the legacy of the heist.(n)</desc>

He has been fighting his council in the Isle of Wight for a much bigger house and is also at loggerheads with the benefits office for capping his weekly payment. West Midlands mother-of-eight Marie Buchanan has recently split from her partner and is looking for a larger home, while Ipswich couple the Fisks have been in dispute with their neighbours, who objected to two houses being knocked into one to accommodate them and their 13 children.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A ragtag group of juvenile delinquents assigned the task of cleaning up an abandoned hotel find out just how deadly community service can be when they are stalked by a monstrous, four-hundred-pound maniac with a grudge in director Gregory Dark's wrestling-infused survival horror flick. It was a mere four years ago that seven-foot menace Jacob Goodnight (WWE superstar Kane) was shot in the head and left for dead by a local police officer. But Jacob wasn't going down that easy. With a steel plate subsequently attached to his skull and ten razor-sharp fingernails ready to scrape grey matter from the skulls of his victims, Jacob retreated to the abandoned Blackwell Hotel, where he resided in the darkened, rotting hallways while planning his ultimate revenge. As fate would have it, Jacob wouldn't have to go far to satiate his raging bloodlust, though, and as the unsuspecting teens make their way through the crumbling corridors of the once-luxurious inn guided by the very same policeman who fired that misguided bullet years earlier, the notorious killer sharpens his nails, stalks his prey, and prepares for a little payback(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The film begins in 1965, when disc jockey Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams) is assigned to take over the AFR's Saigon radio broadcasts. In contrast to the dull, by-rote announcers that have preceded him, Cronauer is a bundle of dynamite, heralding each broadcast with a loud "Goooooood morning, Vietnaaaaam," playing whatever records tickle his fancy (even those not officially sanctioned by his hidebound superiors), and indulging in wild flights of improvisational fancy. Cronauer's immediate superior Lt. Hauk (Bruno Kirby), whose own notions of humor are puerile and pathetic, jealously attempts to dethrone Vietnam's favorite rock jock. Fortunately, Cronauer's popularity is such that he enjoys the full protection of the higher-ups. But when Cronauer, after experiencing the horrors of war first-hand, insists upon telling his listeners the truth instead of the official government line, he is instantly replaced by the unfunny Hauk and must struggle to get back on the air(n)</desc>

Frank Martin (Jason Statham) is a former Special Forces officer who lives on the French Mediterranean and has a lucrative second career as a underworld courier for hire. Martin will deliver anything anywhere, but he has three iron-clad rules - once the plan is in motion it cannot be changed, neither he nor his customers are to ever use their real names, and under no circumstances will he open the package. Martin is hired to make a delivery to a wealthy but unscrupulous American known as Wall Street (Matt Schulze), but after taking possession of the package he realizes that whatever is inside happens to be alive. Breaking his own rule, Martin opens the bag to discover a beautiful Asian woman, Lai (Shu Qi), who is bound and gagged. Lai briefly escapes, but Martin captures her, and delivers her to Wall Street as promised. However, after being given a parcel to deliver by Wall Street, Martin finds out what Wall Street is up to - in partnership with Lai's father Mr. Kwai (Ric Young), Wall Street is part of a scheme to smuggle Asian illegal aliens into France. Martin's conscience gets the better of him, and he sets out to rescue Lai and put Wall Street and Mr. Kwai out of business; however, as if this wasn't enough of a challenge, Martin discovers a French detective, Tarconi (Francois Berleand) has gotten wind of his illegal business. The Transporter was the first English-language feature for Hong Kong-based director Corey Yuen, who along with directing a number of HK action flicks designed fight choreography for several American films(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Phone Booth</title>
    <desc lang="en">One man's life is thrown into turmoil by picking up a telephone in this claustrophobic thriller. Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell) is a brash, cynical, and self-centered public relations man who juggles a busy career with both a wife, Kelly (Radha Mitchell), and a mistress, Pamela (Katie Holmes). Stu steps into a phone booth on a busy New York street to make a call to Pamela without Kelly being the wiser, but as soon as Stu hangs up, the phone begins to ring. Curious, Stu picks it up -- and a stranger on the other end (voice of Kiefer Sutherland) informs him that if he hangs up the phone, he'll be shot. The red dot of an infrared rifle scope convinces Stu that the caller means business, and when another man tries to make his way into the booth, he's shot mere inches from Stu, calling the attention of the police. Captain Ramey (Forest Whitaker) naturally assumes that Stu was the killer, as Stu struggles to find a way to convince the police of what's happening before more lives are lost, without leaving the booth and putting his own life on the line. At one time proposed as a vehicle for Jim Carrey, Phone Booth was directed by Joel Schumacher, from a screenplay by exploitation icon Larry Cohen(n)</desc>

It was a mere four years ago that seven-foot menace Jacob Goodnight (WWE superstar Kane) was shot in the head and left for dead by a local police officer. But Jacob wasn't going down that easy. With a steel plate subsequently attached to his skull and ten razor-sharp fingernails ready to scrape grey matter from the skulls of his victims, Jacob retreated to the abandoned Blackwell Hotel, where he resided in the darkened, rotting hallways while planning his ultimate revenge. As fate would have it, Jacob wouldn't have to go far to satiate his raging bloodlust, though, and as the unsuspecting teens make their way through the crumbling corridors of the once-luxurious inn guided by the very same policeman who fired that misguided bullet years earlier, the notorious killer sharpens his nails, stalks his prey, and prepares for a little payback(n)</desc>

In contrast to the dull, by-rote announcers that have preceded him, Cronauer is a bundle of dynamite, heralding each broadcast with a loud "Goooooood morning, Vietnaaaaam," playing whatever records tickle his fancy (even those not officially sanctioned by his hidebound superiors), and indulging in wild flights of improvisational fancy. Cronauer's immediate superior Lt. Hauk (Bruno Kirby), whose own notions of humor are puerile and pathetic, jealously attempts to dethrone Vietnam's favorite rock jock. Fortunately, Cronauer's popularity is such that he enjoys the full protection of the higher-ups. But when Cronauer, after experiencing the horrors of war first-hand, insists upon telling his listeners the truth instead of the official government line, he is instantly replaced by the unfunny Hauk and must struggle to get back on the air(n)</desc>

Frank Martin (Jason Statham) is a former Special Forces officer who lives on the French Mediterranean and has a lucrative second career as a underworld courier for hire. Martin will deliver anything anywhere, but he has three iron-clad rules - once the plan is in motion it cannot be changed, neither he nor his customers are to ever use their real names, and under no circumstances will he open the package. Martin is hired to make a delivery to a wealthy but unscrupulous American known as Wall Street (Matt Schulze), but after taking possession of the package he realizes that whatever is inside happens to be alive. Breaking his own rule, Martin opens the bag to discover a beautiful Asian woman, Lai (Shu Qi), who is bound and gagged. Lai briefly escapes, but Martin captures her, and delivers her to Wall Street as promised. However, after being given a parcel to deliver by Wall Street, Martin finds out what Wall Street is up to - in partnership with Lai's father Mr. Kwai (Ric Young), Wall Street is part of a scheme to smuggle Asian illegal aliens into France. Martin's conscience gets the better of him, and he sets out to rescue Lai and put Wall Street and Mr. Kwai out of business; however, as if this wasn't enough of a challenge, Martin discovers a French detective, Tarconi (Francois Berleand) has gotten wind of his illegal business. The Transporter was the first English-language feature for Hong Kong-based director Corey Yuen, who along with directing a number of HK action flicks designed fight choreography for several American films(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Phone Booth</title>
    <desc lang="en">One man's life is thrown into turmoil by picking up a telephone in this claustrophobic thriller. Stu Shepard (Colin Farrell) is a brash, cynical, and self-centered public relations man who juggles a busy career with both a wife, Kelly (Radha Mitchell), and a mistress, Pamela (Katie Holmes). Stu steps into a phone booth on a busy New York street to make a call to Pamela without Kelly being the wiser, but as soon as Stu hangs up, the phone begins to ring. Curious, Stu picks it up -- and a stranger on the other end (voice of Kiefer Sutherland) informs him that if he hangs up the phone, he'll be shot. The red dot of an infrared rifle scope convinces Stu that the caller means business, and when another man tries to make his way into the booth, he's shot mere inches from Stu, calling the attention of the police. Captain Ramey (Forest Whitaker) naturally assumes that Stu was the killer, as Stu struggles to find a way to convince the police of what's happening before more lives are lost, without leaving the booth and putting his own life on the line. At one time proposed as a vehicle for Jim Carrey, Phone Booth was directed by Joel Schumacher, from a screenplay by exploitation icon Larry Cohen(n)</desc>

In order to properly participate in the New York City Fire Department's Calendar Contest, Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) and the girls journey from Manhattan to the exotic climes of Staten Island. There, the irascible Samantha (Kim Cattrall) wastes no time in fulfilling her fireman fantasy with hunky Ricky (Mike Lombardi), but is dismayed when their romp is interrupted when Ricky is called upon to fight an actual fire with his colleagues, who, Samantha is aghast to discover, are a bunch of regular Joes who don't live up to her hottie-with-a-hose fantasy. Carrie, meanwhile, finds herself pursued by Bill Kelley (John Slattery), a local politician. Although Carrie resists his overtures, she eventually yields to the older man. As for Charlotte (Kristin Davis), she decides that this will be the year she gets married, but her mission faces its first obstacle in the form of Arthur (Brad Beyer), whom she is currently dating. After he gets into a series of fist fights, Charlotte realizes it's time to move on to someone without bullying tendencies. The perpetually cynical Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) gets a lesson in strength and weakness when, despite her insistence that she doesn't need rescuing, Steve (David Eigenberg) escorts her home following her laser vision surgery and shows her that needing somebody's help shouldn't always be equated with weakness(n)</desc>

Following an encounter with Big's fiancée, the tall, beautiful, twentysomething Natasha (Bridget Moynahan), Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) asks herself if some New York women exist for the sole purpose of making other women feel like hell. To cheer her friend up, Samantha (Kim Cattrall) suggests a day at the spa. The day, however, turns out to be anything but rejuvenating: Acting on a tip that one of the massage therapists performs with more than his hands, Samantha makes a misguided advance on the man that gets her banned from the spa. Charlotte (Kristin Davis) realizes she has problems of another kind when her body issues prevent her from taking it all off in the steam room. Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) has a confrontation with her Ukrainian housekeeper, who insists on lecturing Miranda on everything from herbal teas to marriage. Eventually, all four friends enjoy validation: Samantha by getting the unwilling massage therapist fired; Charlotte by returning naked to the steam room, where another woman compliments her breasts; Miranda by firing her overbearing housekeeper after she replaces Miranda's vibrator with a statue of the Virgin Mary; and Carrie by discovering that for all of her outward charms, Natasha can't escape making certain embarrassing faux pas(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Supercross</title>
    <desc lang="en">Two siblings find themselves competing on and off the racetrack in this action-packed drama. K.C. Carlyle (Steve Howey) and his kid brother, Trip (Mike Vogel), are both racers in the rough and tumble world of supercross, a revved-up variation on motocross racing in which specially modified motorcycle negotiate specially built dirt tracks that send riders through tricky twists and turns, over rough terrain, and off high-flying jumps. Both are talented racers, but K.C. has a wilder and more reckless approach, while Trip follows a more cautious path. A more profound difference between them arises when K.C. is offered a lucrative deal to ride for a factory-sponsored team; he takes the deal, and leaves his brother behind to race on his own dime. However, when an accident takes Trip out of the running on the supercross circuit, he and K.C. set aside their differences as Trip helps coach his older brother so he can succeed in his drive to the championship. Made with the cooperation of a leading supercross race promoter, Supercross: The Movie also stars Sophia Bush and Cameron Richardson as the brothers' love interests, and Robert Carradine as a determined race coach(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Chain Reaction</title>
    <desc lang="en">Andrew Davis, whose previous credits include Under Siege and The Fugitive, brings all his experience to bear on this conspiracy-action-thriller. Keanu Reeves stars as Eddie Kasalivich, a brilliant physicist who's part of a university research team looking at alternative energy solutions. When they crack the holy grail, delivering free energy from water, they're ready to announce their find to the world. But an explosion at their laboratory destroys the work and kills the team leader and Kasalicich, together with Dr Lily Sinclair finds himself suspected of sabotage and murder. On the run, with the mysterious Paul Shannon and the even more shadowy Lyman Earl Collier co-ordinating the operation to track them down and, if necessary, 'terminate them with extreme predjudice', the pair have to not just prove their innocence but save their secret. The double and triple-dealings are balanced by the fast-moving chase sequences with Reeves, a veteran of Speed and The Matrix well used to handling the action role while Weiz's character is a feisty fighter rather than just eye candy(n)</desc>

The case involved tracking down a hactivist collective known as Krampus, who were thought to have been responsible for an incident in which the internet crashed all over Washington, DC. McGee and Abby brought in three known cyber-terrorists for questioning, and discover evidence that links the trio to an attempted breach of the Congress email server and archive. However, when this line of inquiry reaches a dead-end, the team picks up a new lead that suggests an isolated hacker from Wisconsin may be responsible. This `lone wolf' scenario does not seem plausible to McGee, though, as he recalls a lesson his late dad taught him. Crime drama, starring Sean Murray.(n)</desc>

Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) learns that he'll be having a new co-worker at the Nuclear Power Plant, but he's more than a bit surprised by who it turns out to be -- Mindy Simmons (voice of Michelle Pfeiffer), a very sexy redhead. Homer is all the more amazed when he discovers just how much he and Mindy have in common -- they both love doughnuts, beer, hero sandwiches, televised sports, and napping. Homer is more than a bit infatuated with Mindy, and Mindy is obviously attracted to Homer, so when the two are sent to Capital City to represent the Springfield plant at the National Energy Convention, Homer is afraid he may not have the strength to remain faithful to Marge (voice of Julie Kavner). Meanwhile, after a visit to the doctor, Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright) comes home wearing glasses, corrective shoes, and salve in his hair. Bart is told he'll only need to keep up the regimen for a month, but his new nerdy look earns him the ire of the school bullies, and the not-entirely welcome friendship of the geekier kids. "The Last Temptation of Homer" was first aired on December 9, 1993; Werner Klemperer reprises his Hogan's Heroes role as Col.

    <title lang="en">101 Dalmatians</title>
    <desc lang="en">There are more puppies than you can shake a rolled up newspaper at in this live-action remake of the Disney animated favorite 101 Dalmatians. Roger (Jeff Daniels) is a designer of computer games who shares his home with his pet dalmatian, Pongo. One day, Roger takes Pongo for a walk in the park and the dog sets his eyes on a beautiful female dalmatian named Perdy. Perdy likes Pongo as much as he likes her, and thankfully Perdy's mistress, a fashion designer named Anita (Joely Richardson), is quite taken with Roger. Romance blooms between the human and canine couples, and Roger and Anita tie the knot (Pongo and Perdy are apparently still living in sin). Anita works for Cruella De Vil (Glenn Close), an intense fashion maven whose lust for fur doubtless places her high on PETA's hit list. Inspired by her dogs, Anita finds herself working up a design for a fur coat made with spotted fur, and Cruella leaps on the idea of making garments out of real dalmatians. But where to get the animals? Cruella has two nasty but not especially intelligent henchmen, Jasper (Hugh Laurie) and Horace (Mark Williams), who've been known to kill the odd endangered species at madame's request. Now they're sent on a mission to round up dalmatians, and when they fall a bit short of their goal, it comes to Cruella's attention that Perdy has just given birth to a litter of 15 pups. For this version, a number of real dalmatian puppies were combined with computer-generated animation and animatronic creatures from Jim Henson's Workshop, who respond better to direction (and are doubtless easier to clean up after) than the real thing(n)</desc>

It should, of course, be the simplest prosecution ever.

However, once the case comes to court, Crawford, representing himself, proceeds to tear apart the ample evidence that's stacked against him. Can he possibly get away with his crime?

    <title lang="en">101 Dalmatians</title>
    <desc lang="en">There are more puppies than you can shake a rolled up newspaper at in this live-action remake of the Disney animated favorite 101 Dalmatians. Roger (Jeff Daniels) is a designer of computer games who shares his home with his pet dalmatian, Pongo. One day, Roger takes Pongo for a walk in the park and the dog sets his eyes on a beautiful female dalmatian named Perdy. Perdy likes Pongo as much as he likes her, and thankfully Perdy's mistress, a fashion designer named Anita (Joely Richardson), is quite taken with Roger. Romance blooms between the human and canine couples, and Roger and Anita tie the knot (Pongo and Perdy are apparently still living in sin). Anita works for Cruella De Vil (Glenn Close), an intense fashion maven whose lust for fur doubtless places her high on PETA's hit list. Inspired by her dogs, Anita finds herself working up a design for a fur coat made with spotted fur, and Cruella leaps on the idea of making garments out of real dalmatians. But where to get the animals? Cruella has two nasty but not especially intelligent henchmen, Jasper (Hugh Laurie) and Horace (Mark Williams), who've been known to kill the odd endangered species at madame's request. Now they're sent on a mission to round up dalmatians, and when they fall a bit short of their goal, it comes to Cruella's attention that Perdy has just given birth to a litter of 15 pups. For this version, a number of real dalmatian puppies were combined with computer-generated animation and animatronic creatures from Jim Henson's Workshop, who respond better to direction (and are doubtless easier to clean up after) than the real thing(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Y Tu Mamá También and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban director Alfonso Cuarón returns to the helm to tell this futuristic tale in which society is without hope since humankind lost its ability to procreate. The year is 2027, and women can no longer give birth. The youngest inhabitant of the planet has just died at the age of 18, and all hope for humanity has been lost. As civilization descends into chaos, a dying world finds one last chance for survival in the form of a woman who has become inexplicably pregnant. Now, as warring nationalistic sects clash and British leaders try to maintain their totalitarian stronghold on the country, a disillusioned bureaucrat (Clive Owen) is brought back into the fold of activism by his guerrilla ex-wife (Julianne Moore). Reluctantly, he takes on the daunting task of escorting Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey), the refugee who represents humankind's last hope for survival, out of harm's way and into the care of a mysterious organization known as The Human Project. Chiwetel Ejiofor, Charlie Hunnam, and Michael Caine co-star in this adaptation of author P.D. James's gripping 1992 novel(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Y Tu Mamá También and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban director Alfonso Cuarón returns to the helm to tell this futuristic tale in which society is without hope since humankind lost its ability to procreate. The year is 2027, and women can no longer give birth. The youngest inhabitant of the planet has just died at the age of 18, and all hope for humanity has been lost. As civilization descends into chaos, a dying world finds one last chance for survival in the form of a woman who has become inexplicably pregnant. Now, as warring nationalistic sects clash and British leaders try to maintain their totalitarian stronghold on the country, a disillusioned bureaucrat (Clive Owen) is brought back into the fold of activism by his guerrilla ex-wife (Julianne Moore). Reluctantly, he takes on the daunting task of escorting Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey), the refugee who represents humankind's last hope for survival, out of harm's way and into the care of a mysterious organization known as The Human Project. Chiwetel Ejiofor, Charlie Hunnam, and Michael Caine co-star in this adaptation of author P.D. James's gripping 1992 novel(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">101 Dalmatians</title>
    <desc lang="en">There are more puppies than you can shake a rolled up newspaper at in this live-action remake of the Disney animated favorite 101 Dalmatians. Roger (Jeff Daniels) is a designer of computer games who shares his home with his pet dalmatian, Pongo. One day, Roger takes Pongo for a walk in the park and the dog sets his eyes on a beautiful female dalmatian named Perdy. Perdy likes Pongo as much as he likes her, and thankfully Perdy's mistress, a fashion designer named Anita (Joely Richardson), is quite taken with Roger. Romance blooms between the human and canine couples, and Roger and Anita tie the knot (Pongo and Perdy are apparently still living in sin). Anita works for Cruella De Vil (Glenn Close), an intense fashion maven whose lust for fur doubtless places her high on PETA's hit list. Inspired by her dogs, Anita finds herself working up a design for a fur coat made with spotted fur, and Cruella leaps on the idea of making garments out of real dalmatians. But where to get the animals? Cruella has two nasty but not especially intelligent henchmen, Jasper (Hugh Laurie) and Horace (Mark Williams), who've been known to kill the odd endangered species at madame's request. Now they're sent on a mission to round up dalmatians, and when they fall a bit short of their goal, it comes to Cruella's attention that Perdy has just given birth to a litter of 15 pups. For this version, a number of real dalmatian puppies were combined with computer-generated animation and animatronic creatures from Jim Henson's Workshop, who respond better to direction (and are doubtless easier to clean up after) than the real thing(n)</desc>

Yamamoto (Beat Takeshi) is a Japanese gangster who decides it's a good time to get out of Tokyo after a dalliance with a rival branch of the yakuza causes his boss to be killed. Yamamoto flies to Los Angeles and tries to locate his bother Ken (Claude Maki), who is involved in organized crime in California. However, before Yamamoto can track down his sibling, he runs afoul of Denny (Omar Epps), an African-American drug dealer who isn't about to take any back talk from a Japanese tourist. Yamamoto soon discovers, however, that Denny happens to be one of Ken's partners, and soon the adversaries are working together, cautiously developing a mutual respect as Yamamoto becomes one of the new kingpins in the Los Angeles drug cartels. But Denny and Yamamoto may have bitten off more than they can chew when they decide to declare war on the Italian syndicate after aligning themselves with another emigre from the yakuza, Shirase (Masaya Kato).

Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) has just stumbled into the find of a lifetime. Upon discovering a bullet-strewn pickup truck surrounded by the corpses of dead bodyguards, Moss uncovers two million dollars in cash and a substantial load of heroin stashed in the back of the vehicle.

Despite centuries of searching, very little evidence of the location of Cleopatra's tomb has ever been uncovered, but Kathleen's radical new theory on the queen's identity has led her to search where no-one else dared. Her hunch stunned the archaeological establishment as she uncovered a hidden network of tunnels and a vast city of the dead, as well as a 35-metre deep underground hole that bears all the hallmarks of a burial shaft.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Drama-documentary exploring the events of 1483, when Richard, the Duke of Gloucester, put 12-year-old Edward V and younger brother Richard of Shrewsbury into the Tower of London. Weeks later, he pronounced himself king and the boys were never seen again. For more than 500 years it has been thought by some that the monarch killed his own nephews to take the throne, while others believe no crime took place - and that the youngsters lived anonymously into old age. Hearing from experts including David Starkey and Philippa Gregory, the programme tests the competing theories.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Richard III: The New Evidence</title>
    <desc lang="en">Since the discovery of Richard III's remains under a car park in Leicester, scientists have been subjecting the 15th-century English king's skeleton to intense scrutiny and analysis, allowing them to reassemble his life in detail. Using the latest techniques, experts have been able to define the extent to which his spinal deformity would have affected his ability to be the warrior famed for leading the charge at the Battle of Bosworth. They have also pieced together his diet and revealed his lifestyle in his final years, with surprising results. The scientists have been helped in their investigations by a body double, 27-year-old Dominic Smee, who has the same form of scoliosis as Richard III, and this programme follows their findings.(n)</desc>

In the early 1970s, Donald Neilson terrorised the north of England with hundreds of burglaries and armed robberies, shooting dead three people in post office raids in 1974 and earning the nickname of the Black Panther. In 1975, he kidnapped 17-year-old Lesley Whittle and the discovery of her body horrified the nation, and when detectives linked the ransom demand with the robberies, they realised they were dealing with the same man.(n)</desc>

More than 150 years after Charles Darwin formulated his ground-breaking theory of evolution on the remote archipelago, Attenborough explains how life on the islands has continued to evolve in biological isolation, examining how the ever-changing volcanic landscape has given birth to species and sub-species that exist nowhere else in the world. He begins by revealing how Galapagos rose from the ocean four million years ago.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">When Todd Anderson (Storm P) signs a 30-million-dollar contract with the New Jersey Nets after being named the number one NBA draft pick of the year, his mother (Jenifer Lewis) vows to prevent her son from forgetting his roots. Not used to balancing his new life with his old, Todd mistakenly invites family and friends from his old neighborhood to his multi-million-dollar house for a cookout on the same day of an important endorsement interview. Though his extravagant family cookouts were welcome at his old digs, Todd's stuffy new neighbors -- particularly the conservative Republican Judge Halsted Crowley (Danny Glover) -- are less than thrilled with the arrival of Todd's massive family. Complicating the situation further is the eccentric neighborhood security guard (Queen Latifah), who takes on the heady assignment of ensuring that none of the private community's rules are broken, as well as two thugs who, determined to get an autographed pair of sneakers, hold up the cookout at gunpoint. Directed by Lance Rivera, The Cookout also features performances from Ja Rule, Eve, Farrah Fawcett, and Jonathan Silverman(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In 1966, Rubin "Hurricane" Carter was a top-ranked middleweight boxer whom many fight fans expected to become world champion. When three people were shot to death in a bar in Paterson, New Jersey, Carter and his friend John Artis, driving home from another club in Paterson, were stopped and questioned by police. Although the police asserted that Carter and Artis "were never suspects," a man named Alfred Bello, himself a suspect in the killings, claimed that Carter and Artis were present at the time of the murders. On the basis of Bello's testimony, Carter and Artis were convicted of murder, and Carter was given three consecutive life sentences. Throughout the trial, Carter proclaimed his innocence, saying that his African-American race and work as a civil rights activist were the real reasons for his conviction. In 1974, Bello and Arthur Bradley, who also claimed that Carter was present at the scene of the crimes, recanted their testimony, but Carter and Artis were reconvicted. In the early 1980s, Brooklyn teenager Lesra Martin worked with a trio of Canadian activists to push the State of New Jersey to reinvestigate Carter's case; in 1985, a Federal District Court ruled that the prosecution in Carter's second trial committed "grave constitutional violations" and that his conviction was based on racism rather than facts. Carter was finally freed, and he summed up his story by saying, "Hate got me into this place, love got me out." The Hurricane is based on Carter's incredible true story and stars Denzel Washington as Carter, Vicellous Shannon as Lesra Martin, and John Hannah, Liev Schreiber and Deborah Unger as the Canadian activists. Veteran filmmaker Norman Jewison directed(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Hurt Locker</title>
    <desc lang="en">Kathryn Bigelow's multiple-Oscar-winning film is a compelling fact-based, Iraq-set bomb disposal drama, scripted by journalist Mark Boal, drawing on his experiences while embedded with a United States Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal team in 2004. The focus is on the complex characters making up Bravo Company, who disable and destroy improvised explosive devices. The days are ticking down to the end of the bomb squad's tour, but their role puts the team in harm's way around the clock. And it doesn't help that one of the team is addicted to risk taking and pays scant attention to standard procedure, putting other lives in danger, as well as his own. The Hurt Locker provides a tense glimpse into the lives of these extraordinary men, and also probes the various psychologies of people whose job could kill them at any moment, as well as - briefly - exploring how they cope once away from their adrenaline-soaked vocation. Also starring Anthony Mackie, Ralph Fiennes, Guy Pearce, Brian Geraghty and Evangeline Lilly(n)</desc>

Not used to balancing his new life with his old, Todd mistakenly invites family and friends from his old neighborhood to his multi-million-dollar house for a cookout on the same day of an important endorsement interview. Though his extravagant family cookouts were welcome at his old digs, Todd's stuffy new neighbors -- particularly the conservative Republican Judge Halsted Crowley (Danny Glover) -- are less than thrilled with the arrival of Todd's massive family. Complicating the situation further is the eccentric neighborhood security guard (Queen Latifah), who takes on the heady assignment of ensuring that none of the private community's rules are broken, as well as two thugs who, determined to get an autographed pair of sneakers, hold up the cookout at gunpoint. Directed by Lance Rivera, The Cookout also features performances from Ja Rule, Eve, Farrah Fawcett, and Jonathan Silverman(n)</desc>

And it doesn't help that one of the team is addicted to risk taking and pays scant attention to standard procedure, putting other lives in danger, as well as his own. The Hurt Locker provides a tense glimpse into the lives of these extraordinary men, and also probes the various psychologies of people whose job could kill them at any moment, as well as - briefly - exploring how they cope once away from their adrenaline-soaked vocation. Also starring Anthony Mackie, Ralph Fiennes, Guy Pearce, Brian Geraghty and Evangeline Lilly(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Arthur and the Invisibles</title>
    <desc lang="en">On the heels of his first foray into romantic comedy, versatile French filmmaker Luc Besson breaks new ground yet again with this computer-animated, family-friendly adaptation of his own children's book Arthur and the Minimoys. Arthur is a wide-eyed ten-year-old whose vivid imagination is fueled by the colorful bedtime stories his grandmother reads to him each night. His dreams are filled with images of African tribes and the remarkable inventions detailed in the enigmatic book that his grandfather left behind after mysteriously disappearing four years ago. Arthur and his family are in danger of losing their home to an unscrupulous real-estate developer, but if there is any truth to the tales of a treasure hidden deep beneath their garden and the tiny, fairy-like creatures that his grandmother so frequently sketches, there may still be hope of saving their home before it's too late. Now, with nothing to guide him but the clues left behind by his grandfather, Arthur will set out to find the mythical world of Seven Kingdoms, where the Minimoys are said to dwell, and ensure that his troubled family always has a place to call home. An imaginative children's fantasy in the vein of J.M. Barrie's +Peter Pan, Arthur and the Invisibles features the voices of David Bowie, Snoop Dogg, Madonna, Mia Farrow, and Freddie Highmore(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Crying Game</title>
    <desc lang="en">In this successful psychological thriller, a reluctant agent of the Irish Republican Army discovers that some people just aren't who you expect them to be. Fergus (Stephen Rea) is an IRA "volunteer" who, despite personal misgivings, takes part in the kidnapping of a black British soldier, Jody (Forest Whitaker), stationed in Northern Ireland. The IRA hopes to use Jody as a bargaining chip to win the release of IRA operatives behind bars, but, while guarding Jody, Fergus becomes fast friends with his prisoner. Jody makes Fergus promise him that if he dies, Fegus will look in on his girlfriend, Dil (Jaye Davidson), and see if she's all right. Jody escapes, and Fergus doesn't have the heart to shoot him; as fate would have it, Jody runs from the woods into a street only to be run over by a British police vehicle, which then flushes out the IRA compound. Fergus escapes to London, where he's wanted by the law for Jody's kidnapping and also by his former girlfriend, IRA operative Jude (Miranda Richardson), who thinks he knows too much to fall into the hands of the British authorities. Good to his word, Fergus tracks down Dil, and soon the two outcasts find themselves entering into a love affair, although Fergus discovers that Dil is not the sort of woman he thought she was. Writer/director Neil Jordan won an Academy Award for his screenplay; the title song, which was a U.K. hit for Dave Berry in 1965, was re-recorded for the film by one-time Culture Club vocalist Boy George with backing by the Pet Shop Boys(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Cinderella Man</title>
    <desc lang="en">The true story of an athlete who achieved his greatest success against the most daunting odds of his life is brought to the screen in this historical drama. In the 1920s, James Braddock (Russell Crowe) from Bergen, NJ, was a promising contender in professional boxing; he had strength, spirit, and tenacity, but the combination of a serious hand injury and a 1929 defeat in a bout with light heavyweight champ Tommy Loughran sent his career into a serious tailspin. As Braddock's career in the ring dried up, the Great Depression put a stake through the heart of America's economy, and Braddock found himself working at the New York docks for pitiful wages as he tried to support his wife, Mae (Renée Zellweger), and three children. Desperate for money, Braddock turned to his former trainer and manager Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti), who was unexpectedly able to scare up a bout for him, battling John Griffin at Madison Square Garden. While conventional wisdom had it that Braddock was too old, out of shape, and out of practice to have any chance of winning, he defeated Griffin, and continued beating his opponents with a powerful left hook that had been intensified by years of punishing dock work. In a nation desperate for good news, Braddock's surprising comeback became a tonic to struggling workers and unemployed people, and all eyes were on Braddock when in 1935 he took on powerful heavyweight champion Max Baer (Craig Bierko) in what was both literally and figuratively the fight of his life(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Head over Heels</title>
    <desc lang="en">If you think you've seen a man killing someone, does that mean you shouldn't be dating him? This and other questions about modern relationships are explored in this offbeat romantic comedy. Amanda Pierce (Monica Potter) has found a great job (restoring paintings for the Metropolitan Museum of Art) and a great place to live: a spacious East Side apartment that she shares with four successful models, played by Ivana Milicevic, Shalom Harlow, Sarah O'Hare, and Tomiko Fraser. Amanda is still in the market for a great boyfriend, since most of her previous relationships have ended in broken promises or infidelity. She thinks she may have found the right guy in Jim Winston (Freddie Prinze Jr.), but she has reason to believe that he might be guilty of murder. Since she's not sure he has actually done anything, she decides to find out the truth, and her investigation has unexpectedly comic consequences. Head Over Heels was directed by Mark S. Waters, whose first feature, The House of Yes, also starred Freddie Prinze Jr.(n)</desc>

Justin Chambers stars as D'Artagnan, a country-bred lad whose skill with a sword has led to aspirations of becoming a Musketeer, one of the French king's elite guard. Upon arriving in Paris, however, he finds that the Musketeers have been disbanded by order of Cardinal Richelieu (Stephen Rea), who is usurping the king's authority with the help of a lethally gifted henchman, Febre (Tim Roth). Soon, D'Artagnan is embroiled in an effort to prevent a war between his native country and England, meeting up with a beautiful love interest (Mena Suvari) along the way. As he has often done before, director Hyams doubles as his own cinematographer(n)</desc>

When Hannah leaves for a six-week business trip in Scotland, Tom is surprised to realize how truly lonely he is without her. Life just isn't the same without Hannah around, so the moment she returns, Tom resolves to ask for her hand in marriage. But apparently Hannah's trip wasn't all business, because upon returning home Hannah announces that she has gotten engaged to a dashing Scotsman and will soon be starting a new life overseas. She's convinced that Tom will be thrilled for her, and wants him to play a crucial role in the wedding.

    <desc lang="en">Peter La Fleur owns Average Joe's Gym, a scruffy establishment with a loyal clientele, while across the street Globo Gym, owned by White Goodman, is all glass and chrome and full of toned muscle. When La Fleur learns that he must pay the bank $50,000 in 30 days, Goodman is overjoyed: he can acquire his rival's building, knock it down and have the car park his gym's always needed. But La Fleur decides to set up a money-earning dodgeball tournament (a sport that consists of not being hit by balls hurled by the opposing team). And, of course, La Fleur's team of misfits end up in a face-off against Goodman's tough pros in the final. Rawson Marshall Thurber's debut feature is a mix of verbal and physical humour, and, if the outcome is never in doubt, both Vaughn and Stiller throw themselves into the venture with enjoyable gusto(n)</desc>

He can hardly believe his luck; but the night goes wrong when he arrives to pick up his date, and has a painful accident in the toilet, failing to stow his tackle before zipping up. Thirteen years later Ted still yearns for what might have been and hires private dick Pat Healy to find Mary. The detective succeeds but also falls for her and feeds Ted false information so he can keep her for himself. But a suspicious Ted takes matters into his own hands and finds he's in the middle of a love pentagon also involving an architect and an NFL quarterback. With the addition of gags involving a speed-freaked dog, Mary's use of what she believes is Ted's hair gel and a minstrel troupe who follow Ted around, the resulting comedy may not be subtle but is very funny(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Thunder Soul</title>
    <desc lang="en">Most fans of classic soul and funk don't spend much time listening to high school bands, but mention the Kashmere Stage Band and they'll sit up and take notice. In the 1970s, the jazz band at Houston, Texas' Kashmere High School was one of the best in the nation, and even scored regional hits with their recordings. Comprised of students from one of Houston's roughest neighborhoods, the Kashmere Stage Band was the brainchild of Conrad O. Johnson Sr., the school's band director who replaced the band's staid repertoire with a mix of lively jazz and funk tunes and current R&amp;B favorites, and instilled a powerful work ethic in his students that turned the ensemble into an award winner. Johnson, known to his students as "Prof," transformed an otherwise ordinary band into something ground-breaking, and in the documentary Thunder Soul, filmmaker Mark Landsman offers a telling profile of Johnson and his band, featuring photos and footage of the band in their heyday as well as interviews from a recent reunion in which the Kashmere alumni paid tribute to Prof with their first concert in decades. Thunder Soul received its world premiere at the 2010 South by Southwest Film Festival(n)</desc>

When a professor specializing in stem-cell research is murdered, the detectives at first suspect that the killer was a pro-life zealot. It soon develops that the actual target for extermination was the professor's wife (also murdered in the attack), who was raising money and public awareness for Muslim women's rights. Ultimately, the clues lead to a young Muslim extremist who calls himself Mousah Salim, but who is actually an American named Greg Landen (Wil Horneff). In prosecuting the case, the lawyers try to ferret out the motivation behind Landen's wild-eyed fanaticism, with surprising results.
