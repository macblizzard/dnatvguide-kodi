In the early 1980s, a hastily assembled army of Afghan "freedom fighters" achieved the remarkable feat of fending off Soviet invaders despite the fact that the odds were overwhelmingly stacked against them. At the time, Texas congressman Charlie Wilson (Hanks) was a key member of the hugely powerful House Appropriations Committee. Illuminated to the specifics of this remarkable war by a high-profile Houston socialite, Wilson spearheaded an effort to provide hundreds of millions of dollars in weapons and training to the Mujahideen with more than a little help from brilliant but prickly CIA operative Gust Avrokotos(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Joe Darrow works as a doctor in the emergency room of Chicago Memorial Hospital. His wife, Emily Darrow, was last seen in a rainstorm in Venezuela, where she was on a retreat with the Red Cross offering humanitarian aid. She vanished in a bus accident. There were no survivors and her body was never found. That rich, green, exotic land is left behind as Joe is challenged to persevere through sad, rainy days back home. Joe promised Emily that if anything ever happened to her, he would visit her patients in the oncology ward. Strangely, the children seem to know him, and they say they've seen Emily in their near-death experiences. Joe starts to believe that his wife is using the near-death experiences of her terminal patients to communicate with him, through images the children report seeing in their dreams, and symbols they are inexplicably compelled to draw. While the children see Joe as a kindred spirit, the hospital staff worries about how these interactions are agitating them. At home, Joe begins finding other ethereal evidence of his wife's attempt to contact him from beyond the grave, some of it featuring the image of a dragonfly, which was the shape of the birthmark on her shoulder. His friends and a caring neighbor (Kathy Bates) worry that Joe is losing his marbles, especially as his quest becomes more frantic, putting his job in jeopardy(n)</desc>

With artillery shells flying over their heads, the two antagonists gain mutual respect for one another--and as they wake up after a long night's sleep, it appears that they have become far more than friends (if the sly, contented look on Margaret's face is any indication). Meanwhile, B.J. (Mike Farrell) hires a helicopter and conducts a frenzied search for the missing couple(n)</desc>

(Mike Farrell), but only on condition that they perform a variety of menial tasks for him. Before long, Charles has become the 4077's "favorite" loan shark, exacting servitude from virtually everyone in camp. But with the help of Radar (Gary Burghoff), Charles meets his Waterloo--or should we say "whistle-loo"?--during a mammoth poker game(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Smell of Music. Sorely annoyed when Charles (David Ogden Stiers) insists upon playing his French horn incessantly, Hawkeye (Alan Alda) and B.J. (Mike Farrell) issue an ultimatum: Either Charles ceases and desists, or they will refuse to take showers. Before long, the unbathed Hawk and Beej have become so intolerable that they have been "exiled" from the 4077th's mess hall--and practically everywhere else. Ultimately, the feud is settled with a torrent of cold water and a well-calculated "traffic accident", but not before Col. Potter (Harry Morgan) has tackled the more serious issue of a suicidal patient. With this episode, M*A*S*H settled into its fabled Monday-night timeslot, where it would play to spectacular ratings for the next five years(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Golf: The Masters Live: 2017 Day Three.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Hazel Irvine introduces coverage of the third day from the Augusta National in Georgia, as the opening Major of the year continues. Jordan Spieth was the defending champion here last year and seemed destined to retain his crown as he led at the end of the third round, meaning he topped the leaderboard at The Masters for a seventh consecutive round, making it a new tournament record. However, a disappointing round of one-over par saw him finish day three just one stroke clear of compatriot Smylie Kaufman, who himself had carded a three-under 69, and was chasing his first Major success. Meanwhile, Bernhard Langer was the leading European contender on an overall score of one-under, and Danny Willett was tied for fifth alongside Jason Day and Dustin Johnson, though few would have expected the man from Sheffield to claim the first Major of his career as Spieth collapsed on day four. With commentary by Peter Alliss, Ken Brown, Paul Azinger and Andrew Cotter.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">An aging slacker and former sperm donor discovers that he is the biological father of 533 children, and that 142 of them have filed a lawsuit to learn his true identity in this Dreamworks comedy starring Vince Vaughn. Aside from the fact that he was a regular visitor at a fertility clinic 20 years ago, there's nothing particularly remarkable about David Wozniak (Vince Vaughn): He drives a meat-delivery truck for his father's butcher business, he can't seem to hold down a relationship, and lately he's taken to growing marijuana as a means of paying off an $80,000 debt. He's so inept at even the simplest things that his girlfriend Emma (Cobie Smulders) can't stand the sight of him after she reveals that she's pregnant with his child. When an attorney tracks David down and reveals that he is the biological father of 533 children, and that 142 of them have filed a lawsuit to learn his true identity, the former donor panics, recruiting his lawyer friend Brett (Chris Pratt) to defend the privacy agreements he signed at the clinic. When Brett returns with an envelope containing profiles of all 142 children named in the lawsuit, however, David can't help but look, and before long he's surreptitiously injecting himself into the lives of his unsuspecting offspring. Meanwhile, as he begins to grow excited at the prospect of having his own child, he finds that sometimes the best fathers are the men who seem the least fit for parenting(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">A Beautiful Mind</title>
    <desc lang="en">The true story of prominent mathematician John Forbes Nash Jr. is the subject of this biographical drama from director Ron Howard. Russell Crowe stars as the brilliant but arrogant and conceited professor Nash. The prof seems guaranteed a rosy future in the early '50s after he marries beautiful student Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) and makes a remarkable advancement in the foundations of "game theory," which carries him to the brink of international acclaim. Soon after, John is visited by Agent William Parcher (Ed Harris), from the CIA, who wants to recruit him for code-breaking activities. But evidence suggests that Nash's perceptions of reality are cloudy at best; he is struggling to maintain his tenuous hold on sanity, and Alicia suspects a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. Battling decades of illness with the loyal Alicia by his side, Nash is ultimately able to gain some control over his mental state, and eventually goes on to triumphantly win the Nobel Prize. Based loosely on the book of the same name by Sylvia Nasar, A Beautiful Mind (2001) co-stars Paul Bettany, Adam Goldberg, Anthony Rapp, Christopher Plummer, and Judd Hirsch(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Carol Fuchs adapts writer/director Sandra Nettelbeck's screenplay for the 2001 romantic drama Mostly Martha for this Scott Hicks directed remake starring Catherine Zeta-Jones, Aaron Eckhart, and Patricia Clarkson. Kate Armstrong (Jones) is the master chef who is equally intense both in and out of the kitchen. Though Kate's "Type A" personality serves her well when whipping up meals in the trendy Manhattan eatery where she has made a name for herself, it threatens to sink her when she is named as the guardian of her nine-year-old niece Zoe (Little Miss Sunshine's Abigail Breslin). To complicate matters, an impetuous new sous chef named Nick Palmer (Eckhart) has recently joined the kitchen staff and his freewheeling personality seems to stand in direct opposition to Kate's unwavering perfectionism. Yet, despite the fact that they couldn't be more different on the surface, there's no denying the strong attraction between Kate and Nick. As the rivalry between the competitive cooks gradually gives way to romance, the lessons learned by compromising in the kitchen reveal to Kate the importance of learning to openly express herself in order to truly connect with Zoe and find romance with the good-natured Nick(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The true story of prominent mathematician John Forbes Nash Jr. is the subject of this biographical drama from director Ron Howard. Russell Crowe stars as the brilliant but arrogant and conceited professor Nash. The prof seems guaranteed a rosy future in the early '50s after he marries beautiful student Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) and makes a remarkable advancement in the foundations of "game theory," which carries him to the brink of international acclaim. Soon after, John is visited by Agent William Parcher (Ed Harris), from the CIA, who wants to recruit him for code-breaking activities. But evidence suggests that Nash's perceptions of reality are cloudy at best; he is struggling to maintain his tenuous hold on sanity, and Alicia suspects a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. Battling decades of illness with the loyal Alicia by his side, Nash is ultimately able to gain some control over his mental state, and eventually goes on to triumphantly win the Nobel Prize. Based loosely on the book of the same name by Sylvia Nasar, A Beautiful Mind (2001) co-stars Paul Bettany, Adam Goldberg, Anthony Rapp, Christopher Plummer, and Judd Hirsch(n)</desc>

David Attenborough explores how animals attempt to overcome the challenges that face them at each of the six crucial stages of life as they strive towards ultimate success - passing on their genes. This episode follows animals as they grow up in the adult world, developing new skills and learning how to survive on their own. A tiger cub grows up in a very dangerous society. She needs the support of both parents if she is to become an independent adult, but the appearance of a rival to her father may change everything. The veined octopus spends almost all of its time feeding as it races towards adulthood, but this leaves it exposed to predators. In order to protect itself it searches for bits of discarded coconut shell that will fit neatly together. Then it uses them as protective armor. A pair of young cheetah siblings are in a race against starvation. They can only survive by working together to bring down big prey for the first time - an impala weighing more than both cheetahs put together(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Twenty-one years after being torn apart by forces beyond their control, two lovers who have never forgotten one another get a second chance at happiness in this romantic drama from bestselling author Nicholas Sparks. Dawson (Luke Bracey) and Amanda (Liana Liberato) were just teenagers when they fell hopelessly and helplessly in love. Unfortunately for them, it just wasn't meant to be -- at least not then. Two decades later, in the wake of a mutual friend's death, Dawson (James Marsden) and Amanda (Michelle Monaghan) are reunited as adults. Their passion still burns as bright as ever, too, but just when it seems as if their happy ever after is finally within reach, they discover that the very same threat that separated them in youth has returned stronger, and more determined to divide them than ever before(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Best of Me</title>
    <desc lang="en">Twenty-one years after being torn apart by forces beyond their control, two lovers who have never forgotten one another get a second chance at happiness in this romantic drama from bestselling author Nicholas Sparks. Dawson (Luke Bracey) and Amanda (Liana Liberato) were just teenagers when they fell hopelessly and helplessly in love. Unfortunately for them, it just wasn't meant to be -- at least not then. Two decades later, in the wake of a mutual friend's death, Dawson (James Marsden) and Amanda (Michelle Monaghan) are reunited as adults. Their passion still burns as bright as ever, too, but just when it seems as if their happy ever after is finally within reach, they discover that the very same threat that separated them in youth has returned stronger, and more determined to divide them than ever before(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">(2001) Alan Cumming and Jennifer Jason Leigh wrote, produced and directed The Anniversary Party , still finding the energy to star as Joe and Sally Therrian, a Hollywood couple celebrating their sixth anniversary. He's a writer trying his hand at directing, she's an actress who's feeling time catching up with her. Invited to the party are a host of friends from their demi-monde, including Kevin Kline as Cal Gold, no longer first call when a rom-com leading man is needed; and Gwyneth Paltrow as Skye Davidson, a rising young star. Also invited are the Therrians' neighbours Ryan and Monica Rose (Denis O'Hare and Mina Badie) who have nothing in common with the gathering of once bright young things. But as the night progresses and drink and drugs begin to take effect, truths are revealed, old enmities expressed and sexual scores settled in a cool, intelligent film that is about smart people whose lives are ruined by having to act dumb(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A scrawny rat named Remy (voice of Patton Oswalt) finds his dreams of culinary superstardom stirring up sizable controversy in the kitchen of a fine French restaurant in director Brad Bird's madcap computer-animated comedy. It's hard being a rat with culinary aspirations, but Remy is convinced he has what it takes to break the stereotypes and follow in the footsteps of star chef Auguste Gusteau (voice of Brad Garrett). As fate would have it, Remy is currently situated in the sewers directly beneath Gusteau's elegant restaurant. Soon Remy teams up with a young chef with little talent named Linguini (voice of Lou Romano). Together they are able to create some fabulous dishes, but they live in fear that someone will discover their secret and object strenuously to a rat being in a kitchen. When Remy's passion for cooking turns the haughty world of French cuisine upside down, the rat who would be king of the kitchen learns important lessons about life, friends, and family while questioning whether he should pursue his culinary calling or simply go back underground and return to his life as a sewer rat(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Simpson and Delilah. Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) has never been happy about his premature baldness, and has tried a number of products that claim to restore hair growth, with no luck. However, when a new hair growth treatment called Dimoxinil goes on the market, Homer is eager to try it -- until he discovers a supply costs 1,000 dollars. Homer's pal Lenny (voice of Harry Shearer) suggests he simply falsify an insurance form from work to pay for the formula, and before long Homer's desire for hair overpowers his scruples and he gives it a try. To Homer's ecstatic surprise, the Dimoxinil works like a charm, and he discovers a full head of hair makes a profound difference in his life -- he's more confident, more enthusiastic in bed, and when his boss Mr. Burns (also voiced by Shearer) mistakes him for "a young go-getter," he's given a big promotion. Homer soon finds he's in over his head, but with the help of his selfless assistant Karl (voice of Harvey Fierstein), Homer looks like he's on the fast track to success at the Nuclear Power Plant. However, Smithers (also voiced by Shearer), Burns' right-hand man, resents Homer's status as Mr. Burns' new favorite employee, and is soon looking for a way to move Homer out of the picture. "Simpson and Delilah" was first broadcast on October 18, 1990(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The four heat winners enter the quarter-final, in which they face the daunting challenge of the Critic's Brief. Guest judge Jay Rayner gives them a simple instruction for a main dish - the twist being, the amateur cooks don't know who has set it until they come face to face with the food critic to hear his verdict. It's then back to the kitchen to prepare a dessert, again based on Rayner's brief - and this time, the one that doesn't make the grade fails to make it through to knockout week.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">John Torode and Gregg Wallace put more keen cooks to the test in first of two heats this week. As usual they begin by serving up their Calling Card, a dish that showcases their talents. The judges' two favourites then sit it out while the others reinvent what they've just made, creating a new plate of food based on the main ingredient from the first round. After this cook-off, one of the amateurs is sent home, before the remaining four prepare dinner for a trio of former MasterChef champions, after which Friday's first two quarter-finalists will be decided.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Heartbreakers</title>
    <desc lang="en">After the little white lies of Romy and Michele's High School Reunion (1997), director David Mirkin focuses on scheming of a different sort in Heartbreakers. Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt play Max and Page Conners, a mother and daughter who share everything with each other: relationship advice, hair and makeup hints, and the money they win in costly divorce settlements with rich men. When the film opens, the Conners are putting the finishing touches on conning Dean (Ray Liotta), an auto-body shop owner. When the dust from that scam clears, Page announces she's ready to move away from her mother and set up shop on her own -- but in order to clear an outstanding debt, Max insists they bankrupt one more bachelor together. They settle upon phlegmatic Palm Springs widower William B. Tensy (Gene Hackman), a chain smoker with a heart of gold and a similarly bountiful bank account. Only two things stand in their way: Tensy's Teutonic caretaker Miss Madress (Nora Dunn) and beachfront bartender Jack (Jason Lee), a wry stargazer with whom Page becomes unexpectedly smitten. Heartbreakers is the third collaboration from writers Steven Mazur and Paul Guy, whose previous screwball comedy was 1997's international hit, Liar Liar(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Immigration Tango</title>
    <desc lang="en">Love crosses international boundaries and makes a big mess en route in this romantic comedy. Carlos Sanchez (Carlos Leon) is from Latin America, and Elena Dubrovnik (Elika Portnoy) is from Russia. Carlos and Elena are in love and living in the United States, but while they'd like to stay, they have a problem -- their visas are soon to expire, and they aren't sure when or if they'll be able to get green cards that will allow them permanent residence. Carlos and Elena are close friends with Mike White (McCaleb Burnett) and Betty Bristol (Ashley Wolfe), who were born and raised in the States. Like Carlos and Elena, Mike and Betty are planning to marry but haven't done so yet, and when they learn of their friends' dilemma, someone comes up with a solution -- Carlos will marry Betty, Mike will marry Elena, and once their respective green cards come through, both couples will divorce and everyone lives happily ever after. However, the plan doesn't go as smoothly as expected -- suspicious immigration agents are keeping a close watch on Carlos and Elena, so the newlyweds have to live with their respective spouses and act happily married in order to maintain the illusion of matrimony, which leads the four friends into a variety of romantic complications. Immigration Tango received its world premiere at the 2010 Boston International Film Festival(n)</desc>

When difficulties start interfering with their tricks, psychoanalysis appears as an alternative to pills.

When he finally meets her, she is completely fascinated by her father's lifestyle, so much so, that she wants to go into partnership with him. At the casting for this film, Lohman dressed and behaved like a 14-year-old, until, under pressure from Ridley Scott, she admitted to being 22(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Slumdog Millionaire</title>
    <desc lang="en">Accused of cheating and desperate to prove his innocence, an eighteen-year-old orphan from the slums of Mumbai reflects back on his tumultuous life while competing to win 20 million rupees on India's Who Wants to Be a Millionaire in Danny Boyle's inspirational drama. Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) may not have a penny to his name, but that could all change in a matter of hours. He's one question away from taking the top prize on India's most popular television game show, but as with everything else in Jamal's life, it isn't going to be easy. Arrested by police under suspicion of cheating, Jamal is interrogated by the authorities. The police simply can't believe that a common "slumdog" could possibly possess the knowledge to get this far in the game, and in order to convince them of how he gained such knowledge, Jamal begins reflecting back on his childhood. As young boys, Jamal and his older brother, Salim, lived in squalor, and lost their mother in a mob attack on Muslims. Subsequently forced to rely on their own wits to survive, the desperate siblings fell back on petty crime, eventually befriending adorable yet feisty young Latika as they sought out food and shelter on the unforgiving streets of Mumbai. Though life on the streets was never easy, Jamal's experiences ultimately instilled in him the knowledge he needed to answer the tough questions posed to him on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. And though Jamal makes a convincing case for himself, one question still remains: why would a young man with no apparent desire for wealth or fame be so determined to win big on a national game show? Of course, it won't be long until everyone finds out the answer to this burning question, because as Jamal sits down to find out whether he will be rich beyond his wildest dreams, 60 million viewers remain transfixed to their televisions eager to see if he'll correctly answer the final question(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Slumdog Millionaire</title>
    <desc lang="en">Accused of cheating and desperate to prove his innocence, an eighteen-year-old orphan from the slums of Mumbai reflects back on his tumultuous life while competing to win 20 million rupees on India's Who Wants to Be a Millionaire in Danny Boyle's inspirational drama. Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) may not have a penny to his name, but that could all change in a matter of hours. He's one question away from taking the top prize on India's most popular television game show, but as with everything else in Jamal's life, it isn't going to be easy. Arrested by police under suspicion of cheating, Jamal is interrogated by the authorities. The police simply can't believe that a common "slumdog" could possibly possess the knowledge to get this far in the game, and in order to convince them of how he gained such knowledge, Jamal begins reflecting back on his childhood. As young boys, Jamal and his older brother, Salim, lived in squalor, and lost their mother in a mob attack on Muslims. Subsequently forced to rely on their own wits to survive, the desperate siblings fell back on petty crime, eventually befriending adorable yet feisty young Latika as they sought out food and shelter on the unforgiving streets of Mumbai. Though life on the streets was never easy, Jamal's experiences ultimately instilled in him the knowledge he needed to answer the tough questions posed to him on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. And though Jamal makes a convincing case for himself, one question still remains: why would a young man with no apparent desire for wealth or fame be so determined to win big on a national game show? Of course, it won't be long until everyone finds out the answer to this burning question, because as Jamal sits down to find out whether he will be rich beyond his wildest dreams, 60 million viewers remain transfixed to their televisions eager to see if he'll correctly answer the final question(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This spiritually-themed documentary rests on a central, simple discovery: though the Christian take on the "end of the world" (as described in the Revelation of St. John) has received exhaustive treatment in various films and books, the actual concept of Armageddon - a final battle between God and Satan - is rarely discussed. This program constitutes an unusual exception; it actually dissects clues given in scripture in an attempt to determine truths about what will happen just before the final curtain comes down on the world. It suggests that the said battle will transpire at Meggido, a battlefield that still exists in present-day Israel. The program asks where the stories of Armageddon come from, how they have evolved over the years and how they vary among the three major religions that claim Abraham as a central figure(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">An idyllic summer day in Oxford is torn asunder when a parcel bomb claims the life of eminent mathematician Adam Capstone, a genius in the field of `Knot Theory'. As Lewis and Hathaway investigate, they discover that, while the victim's academic reputation was beyond reproach, his private life was far more dubious. It emerges Capstone was a man of carnal appetites, who had a string of affairs with young students, betraying his chemistry professor wife Elizabeth, providing her with a clear motive to do away with her cheating spouse. As the detectives work to identify the killer bomber, the case becomes a personal challenge for Lewis, who fears he may not be rewarded with another contract should he fail to impress Moody before his six-month trip to New Zealand. Detective drama, starring Kevin Whately and Laurence Fox, with Zoe Tapper, Tristam Summers and Oliver Lansley.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The competition begins at stately home Anstey Hall in Cambridge, with father and son team John and Johnny de Bruyne. The fun starts with a character-revealing afternoon of goose-herding, before the participants dress to impress at a formal dinner. John recounts stories of royal connections - which fails to impress hotel managers Mark and Layla. In the morning, as they tuck in to a self-service breakfast, guest Tim decides that DIY doesn't work at Anstey Hall, but when he notes this on his feedback form, John and Johnny accuse him of game-playing.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The second visit of the competition is to clothes-free Clover Spa and Hotel in Birmingham, where owner Tim Higgs hopes to convert his rivals to the joys of naturism. Judging with an extra critical eye are John and Jonny De Bruyne, who received negative feedback from Tim, and a thorough room inspection reveals a dusty porn DVD. Tim tries to encourage his nervous guests to take part in a naked spa experience, but John opts to watch television instead. When feedback is invited, Tim is delighted to discover Mark and Layla would stay again but shocked by the `porn film' discovery.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The final stay is at Higher Gitcombe in Totnes, Devon, where owners Paul and Lynnie Jolly set out to spoil their guests. Everyone is overwhelmed by the added extras, but naturist Tim is put off by cushions and clutter. After a masterclass in Nordic walking, Lynnie serves up a veg smoothie, which unhealthy eaters Mark and Layla dubiously down in one. Over dinner, Tim challenges his host's organic 'niche'. And Layla, still smarting from his negative feedback, labels him 'weird, naked Tim'. At breakfast, guests are wary as Tim's order goes wrong and Jonny and Layla engage in an eating competition. When feedback is invited, the Jollys are affronted by accusations of special treatment and vow to put the record straight.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Part one of two. Biologist Patrick Aryee explores how cats have evolved throughout the millennia, learning to thrive in inhospitable environments, as well as becoming the world's most popular pet. In the first edition there is spectacular footage of caracals jumping three metres to catch flying birds, and a rare Bornean bay cat, which was thought to have been extinct. Patrick finds out how tigers made the transition from South-east Asia's steamy jungles to the -40C temperatures of Siberia, and meets `lion whisperer' Kevin Richardson.(n)</desc>

He discovers they and his own family have more in common than he imagined possible - adolescent males are just like his teenage sons, with bulging muscles but little sense. John spends time with the Gorilla Doctors, a group of vets dedicated to protecting the 880 animals still in the wild by treating them at the first sign of illness or injury. He learns that the vets once had to amputate the bottom part of a three-day-old's leg and he not only survived, but is also on track to become a full-grown Silverback.(n)</desc>

Heather ran into complications during her first pregnancy and had to deliver twins at 24 weeks. They pulled through, but cerebral palsy and other issues have meant she is now a full-time carer to them both. She also has Alfie, and after he was born, she and partner Dan decided they would have a fourth child to give him a companion to help share the responsibility of siblings with a disability. Christian couple Naomi and Dan tied the knot young and had their first child 13 months ago. Now, they're back at Southmead for baby number two.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Meskada</title>
    <desc lang="en">Class and economics muddy the investigation of a homicide in this thriller from director Josh Sternfeld. When a child is found murdered in the small town of Hilliard, police detective Noah Cordin (Nick Stahl) is assigned to investigate the case. The victim's mother, Allison Connor (Laura Benanti), is a wealthy and well-connected member of the County Board of Commissioners, so Cordin is under pressure to find the killer as soon as possible, but working with rookie officer Leslie Spencer (Rachel Nichols), he isn't finding many substantial clues. One of the few pieces of evidence suggests the culprit may have been from the nearby town of Caswell. Cordin was born and raised in Caswell and knows its history well -- while Hilliard is a prosperous suburban community, Caswell is a working-class town fallen on hard times, and its survival is dependent on a proposed factory coming into town. As Cordin spends more and more time in Caswell, he becomes a target for the resentment the locals feel toward their wealthier neighbors, and a tense situation becomes potentially explosive when word begins to circulate that Connor may use her influence to keep the new employer out of Caswell unless someone comes forward to identity who killed her son. Meskada (named for the county that contains both Hilliard and Caswell) also stars Norman Reedus, Kellan Lutz, Jonathan Tucker, and Grace Gummer(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Battle Royale</title>
    <desc lang="en">In a future where society is on the verge of collapse, the government takes drastic action against the problem of rebellious teenagers in this violent sci-fi opus from Japan. In the year 2002, Japan's economy has taken a dramatic turn for the worse, and massive unemployment and inflation have thrown most adults into a state of chaos; the nation's youth culture responds with unprecedented violence, delinquency, and truancy. Desperate to restore order, the Japanese parliament responds by creating the Millennial Reform School Act, in which groups of junior high students are selected at random, sent to an isolated island, and forced to play a rigorous war game, in which all but one of their number are killed. Kitano (Beat Takeshi) is an embittered school instructor who guides the 44 students of the Zentsuji Middle School's Class B through the deadly game known as "Battle Royale," as they struggle to survive against the elements and each other. Battle Royale proved to be both successful and highly controversial in Japan, where it set box-office records and prompted political leaders to call for stricter controls on violence in Japanese entertainment; the film was initially rated R-15 (no one under 15 admitted), unusual for violent films in Japan, though director Kinji Fukasaku later prepared a re-edited version that earned a more lenient classification(n)</desc>

That friendship is put to the ultimate test, however, when their adult children begin to act out in ways that neither parent ever saw coming. Alice's daughter Andrea (Sanaa Lathan) is married to a trusting husband named Chris (Rockmond Dunbar), but lately she's been betraying that trust by sleeping with her boss, William (Cole Hauser), who just so happens to be Charlotte's son. William is married to Jillian (KaDee Strickland), and in addition to being unfaithful, he's also scheming to take over the role of COO at his mother's lucrative construction firm. Meanwhile, Alice's other daughter, Pam (Taraji P.

    <title lang="en">Premonition</title>
    <desc lang="en">Devastated upon receiving the news that her husband has been killed in a tragic car accident, a woman wakes up to find him still very much alive as she begins to slip into a confusing world where the past and the future become increasingly difficult to distinguish. Linda Hanson (Sandra Bullock) was an average housewife with a loving family, but when a policeman comes knocking on her door with news that her husband, Jim (Julian McMahon), was involved in a fatal car accident, Linda's world slowly begins to unravel. While her grief is at first overwhelming, Linda assumes that the whole thing was nothing more than a vivid dream when she wakes to find her family still very much intact. With each passing day, however, Linda's reality shifts and her circumstances grow increasingly surreal; one day Jim is dead and the next he is right there by her side. As her investigation leaves her convinced that her husband's death wasn't a dream and that her picture-perfect life may not have been quite as flawless as she thought, Linda embarks on a mind-bending journey to prevent her grim premonition from becoming a reality. Now, in order to save the man she loves, Linda will have to piece together a perplexing mystery that seems to span two separate planes of reality(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Father of Invention</title>
    <desc lang="en">An entrepreneur with a world-class ego has to rebuild his empire and his family relationships from scratch in this comedy. Robert Axle (Kevin Spacey) built a multi-million-dollar business out of selling household gadgets through television infomercials, and managed to alienate nearly everyone around him when fame and wealth turned him into an arrogant loudmouth. When one of Axle's products turns out to be dangerous and causes several thousand customers to lose a finger, he loses his fortune and spends eight years in prison for gross negligence. Back on the street, Axle is broke but determined to find a way back to the top, though he's just a bit more humble than he used to be and wants to win back the love of his daughter, Claire (Camilla Belle), whom he neglected as a child, and his ex-wife (Virginia Madsen). Things go badly for Axle on his first day working at a big-box discount store, and he's left with little alternative than to ask Claire to let him stay with her; she and her roommate, Fibbi (Heather Graham), aren't so sure this is a good idea, but they grudgingly agree and end up helping Axle in his bid to redeem himself. Father of Invention also stars Johnny Knoxville, Craig Robinson, and Michael Rosenbaum(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Gabrielle Union, Morris Chestnut, Queen Latifah, and Terrence Howard star in a film concerning a young girl who implores a department-store Santa to find a new husband for her divorced mother for Christmas. Single mother of three Nancy (Union) has been putting the needs of her three children ahead of her own for as far back as she can remember, and lately her youngest daughter, Emily (Khail Bryant), has become acutely aware of her mother's palpable sadness. As Christmas draws near, Nancy takes her kids to the mall for a cheerful visit with jolly old Saint Nick. When it comes time for Emily's turn to sit on Santa's lap and make her Christmas wish, she selflessly remembers her mother's recent comment that a compliment from a man would be the best gift of all. Determined to make her mother happy again even if it means sacrificing her own wish, Emily relays the message to Santa (Chestnut), not realizing that the man beneath the beard is actually an office-supply salesman and ambitious singer/songwriter named Benjamin. Recognizing the daughter's love for her mother and sensing something truly special in Nancy, Benjamin cheerfully obliges the young girl, setting into motion a series of events that promise to make this the most memorable holiday in quite some time.

    <title lang="en">Friday the 13th</title>
    <desc lang="en">(2009) Director Marcus Nispel seems to have a bit of a thing for remakes, having remoulded The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in 2003, as well as Conan the Barbarian in 2011. However, in this slasher horror, Nispel compresses elements of the first four films in the Friday the 13th franchise, which started way back in 1980, into one blood-sodden whole. This retread gives some background as to why Jason Voorhees (Derek Mears) became such a relentlessly homicidal maniac, before getting on with the business of steel on flesh and bucketloads of gore, delivering the movie's raison d'être. Some weeks after his sister goes missing, Clay Miller's (Jared Padalecki) search for his sibling leads him to Crystal Lake, a remote, wooded campsite. Also arriving at the spot is a group of young revellers, intent on partying. But it's not long before the man with the hockey mask and machete pays them a visit - one that any survivors are unlikely to forget. Can any of them escape Voorhees' latest murderous rampage? Or will they all vanish like Clay's sister and her friends?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A group of adventurous young friends on a trip to the Caribbean decide to explore a secluded island, where they unleash a highly contagious, flesh-eating virus after swimming in contaminated water, and exploring a research facility that houses a terrifying secret. Somewhere on an uncharted island deep in the Caribbean, the doctors at a secluded research lab have managed to quarantine Porter (Sean Astin), the first person to be infected by an aggressive flesh-eating virus. Meanwhile, not too far away, Marcus (Mitch Ryan) is preparing to get married when his brother Josh (Brando Eaton), Josh's girlfriend Penny (Jillian Murray), and their best friend Dobbs (Ryan Donowho) lure him onto a luxury yacht to celebrate his last night of freedom. Upon arriving at a picturesque island that isn't on the maps, Josh and Penny stay on the beach to do a little snorkeling while Marcus and Dobbs set up the campsite. Returning to the tent in a panic after spotting scores of dead fish in the water, Penny breaks out in a rash that Josh credits to some bad local ganja. Later, when Josh also shows signs of infection, Marcus and Dobbs venture out for help and break into the darkened research facility, which appears to have been the scene of a bloody struggle. Their worst fears are realized when they discover that they have stumbled upon the site of a deadly outbreak, and that the egomaniacal doctor (Currie Graham) in charge is determined to take credit for curing the disease -- even if it means that no one gets off the island alive(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The 1987 National Football League players' strike inspired this sports-themed comedy. The Washington Sentinels are one of the strongest teams in pro football -- until contract negotiations break down and the Sentinels go on strike. Determined to play the team's schedule, owner Edward O'Neil (Jack Warden) recruits a ragtag band of scab players, to be headed up and whipped into shape by the retired veteran coach Jimmy McGinty (Gene Hackman). At the top of the recruitment list is quarterback Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves), a promising athlete until a catastrophic defeat in the Sugar Bowl dashed his confidence. Joining Falco on the team are Clifford Franklin (Orlando Jones), a receiver who can't catch the ball; Nigel Gruff (Rhys Ifans), a chain-smoking Welsh soccer player; Bateman (Jon Favreau), a former cop with anger management problems; Fumiko (Ace Yonamine), a sumo wrestler new to football; and Wilkinson (Michael Jace), a convict on parole to the Sentinels. Can McGinty mold his new squad of misfits and no-hopers (who truly love the game) into a winning team? Brooke Langton plays Annabelle, head of the Sentinels' cheerleading squad (who has to contend with replacements of her own), and football commentators John Madden and Pat Summerall appear as themselves(n)</desc>
