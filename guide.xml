    <desc lang="en">Director/screenwriter David Gordon Green adapts Stewart O'Nan's popular novel to the screen in this feature, which tells the parallel tales of a teenager named Arthur (Michael Angarano) and his onetime babysitter Annie (Kate Beckinsale) -- whose turbulent relationship with her estranged husband, Glenn (Sam Rockwell), leads the small-town waitress down a troubled path. Arthur is a high-school student from a dysfunctional family, and does everything in his power to avoid hanging around the house while mom and dad quarrel. When he's not practicing his trombone and performing with the high-school marching band, Arthur can usually be found bussing tables at the local Chinese restaurant and flirting with older waitress Annie. Annie used to be Arthur's babysitter, and is currently struggling to separate from her former high-school sweetheart, Glenn. But being a single mother isn't easy, especially since the troubled Glenn wants nothing more than to clean up his act and reunite his family. Back at school, Arthur and pretty classmate Lila (Olivia Thirlby) have been bonding over their mutual love for all things geeky. Though the casual friendship shows promise of evolving into something more when Lila expresses her true feelings for Arthur, he can't help but becoming distracted by his chaotic family life: his father is moving out of the family home, and his mother is doing everything in her power to maintain some semblance of normalcy. Realizing that happiness is fleeting as his family becomes shattered and Annie experiences a series of distressing encounters with Glenn, Arthur gradually begins to fall for Lisa despite his growing cynicism concerning long-term relationships. Later, on a cold winter morning, Glenn and Annie's past catches up with them in a blinding flash, and the lives of everyone they know are suddenly and irrevocably changed(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">White Christmas</title>
    <desc lang="en">Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye and Rosemary Clooney star in this festive family favourite from prolific director Michael Curtiz. Bob Wallace (Crosby) and Phil Davis (Kaye) are friends who met while serving in World War II and have subsequently become a very successful song-and-dance team. They meet singing sisters Betty (Clooney) and Judy (Vera-Ellen) at a nightclub in Florida and, with a hint of romance in the air, together head off to rural Vermont, where the girls are booked to appear at a ski lodge. When they arrive, they discover that the place is run by the men's former commanding officer, Major General Waverly (Dean Jagger), who's in dire financial straits because unseasonably warm weather is keeping the snow at bay. So the four entertainers make plans to bail him out by staging a spectacular musical benefit show... Shot in Technicolor, the film was the first to be released in the high-resolution widescreen VistaVision format and, with its songs written by Irving Berlin, the movie was the year's top box-office hit(n)</desc>

Len Goodman, Bruno Tonioli, Craig Revel Horwood and Darcey Bussell give their comments and score the performances, but they are for guidance only - the decision as to who waltzes off with this year's title is strictly down to the viewers' vote. Emeli Sande provides the music, the 2016 cast return for a final group performance and there is a fond farewell to head judge Len - even though he will be back for the Christmas special.

    <desc lang="en">Richard Hammond presents this chilly version of Total Wipeout, which sees the contestants wrapping up warm to tackle a snow-covered course with winter-themed obstacles and seasonal challenges. They must manoeuvre themselves past Granny's House, watching out for the angry dog nipping at their ankles and a front door guaranteed to smack them in the face. They then cling onto the ski lift to avoid plunging into the icy waters, before riding the conveyor belt that throws them onto those old Wipeout favourites, the big red balls. Amanda Byram laughs it up at the side of the course.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Hollywood Ending</title>
    <desc lang="en">A down-on-his luck auteur gets one more chance at the big time -- provided his neuroses don't swallow him whole -- in Woody Allen's 33rd feature release, Hollywood Ending. Allen plays Val Waxman, a one-time cinematic genius who's resorted to taking advertisement work to pay the bills for himself and his airhead live-in girlfriend, Lori (Debra Messing). Val finds his luck is about to change, however, when he receives the script for The City Never Sleeps , a period noir set against the backdrop of 1940s New York City. It seems his ex-wife, Ellie (Tea Leoni), now an executive at Galaxy Pictures, has been pulling for him to direct the picture, claiming he's the only man who can do justice to the script. She even manages to convince her boyfriend, Hal (Treat Williams), Galaxy's high-powered studio head, to take a chance on Val's "unique vision." Just when the cameras are ready to roll, however, Val finds that unique vision in jeopardy -- literally -- as he's struck with a psychosomatic case of blindness. When physicians and psychiatrists fail to cure him, Val contrives a scheme to forge ahead with the picture, for fear of blowing his one last chance at greatness. Hollywood Ending co-stars George Hamilton and Mark Rydell(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A down-on-his luck auteur gets one more chance at the big time -- provided his neuroses don't swallow him whole -- in Woody Allen's 33rd feature release, Hollywood Ending. Allen plays Val Waxman, a one-time cinematic genius who's resorted to taking advertisement work to pay the bills for himself and his airhead live-in girlfriend, Lori (Debra Messing). Val finds his luck is about to change, however, when he receives the script for The City Never Sleeps , a period noir set against the backdrop of 1940s New York City. It seems his ex-wife, Ellie (Tea Leoni), now an executive at Galaxy Pictures, has been pulling for him to direct the picture, claiming he's the only man who can do justice to the script. She even manages to convince her boyfriend, Hal (Treat Williams), Galaxy's high-powered studio head, to take a chance on Val's "unique vision." Just when the cameras are ready to roll, however, Val finds that unique vision in jeopardy -- literally -- as he's struck with a psychosomatic case of blindness. When physicians and psychiatrists fail to cure him, Val contrives a scheme to forge ahead with the picture, for fear of blowing his one last chance at greatness. Hollywood Ending co-stars George Hamilton and Mark Rydell(n)</desc>

Narrated by American Justice host and producer Bill Kurtis, this episode goes inside the investigation of the two murders that Walker and her boyfriend Daniel Ryan Garrett committed. The trial of Walker is shown through exclusive footage. After the conviction, American Justice follows her through her daily life, showing her prison surroundings and talking with her about her crimes. Sentenced to death, while Walker was waiting to be executed, she became a born-again Christian. Her lawyers used this transformation as leverage to try to get her death sentence reduced to life in prison. Their attempts were unsuccessful and Walker was killed by lethal injection in February 1998. American Justice also shows interviews with lawyers and law enforcement professionals who knew Walker(n)</desc>

Helen then discovers that Harry is a secret agent by night, working for a shadowy group called the Omega Sector.

    <title lang="en">Schindler's List</title>
    <desc lang="en">Steven Spielberg's masterwork deals with the Holocaust, but the Holocaust on a personal level -- how one man's morality and humanity changes in the face of unmitigated horror. As the film's tagline aptly sums it up: "Whoever saves one life, saves the entire world." The film begins in Krakow, Poland in 1939. Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), an imposing, well-dressed bon-vivant is seen buying drinks and caviar for Nazi officers, who permit him to open up a clay-pot factory, enlisting cheap labor provided by Jewish refugees. Schindler asks Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), a Jewish accountant, to help him obtain backing for the factory. By 1941, the Jewish community has been herded into the Ghetto, and the elders agree to back Schindler, reasoning that having a job might guarantee the Jews a reprieve from death in the concentration camps. But, by 1943, the Ghetto is being liquidated, and the remaining residents are brought to the Plaszow Forced Labor Camp. The commandant, Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) is a cold-blooded Nazi sadist, who at the same time is attracted to Jewish inmate Helen Hirsch (Embeth Davidtz), whom he makes his maid. When the time came for his unpaid Jewish workers to be sent to their deaths, Schindler was able to rescue over a thousand of them by placing them on his special list of "essential" workers and by befriending Goeth and using his friendship to campaign for their reprieve(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">True Lies</title>
    <desc lang="en">Borrowing liberally from the French film La Totale, this is an action picture, domestic comedy, and political thriller rolled into a crowd-pleasing ball of entertainment. Producer James Cameron wrote and directed the film. Henry Tasker (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a workaholic computer salesman neglecting his mousy wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis), a legal secretary. Simon (Bill Paxton) seduces Helen with the lie that he is a secret agent; he's really a used car salesman. Harry suspects that Helen is cheating on him, and he sends a few colleagues to kidnap them. Helen then discovers that Harry is a secret agent by night, working for a shadowy group called the Omega Sector. Harry and his partner Gib (Tom Arnold) are trying to find four nuclear warheads that have disappeared from a former Soviet republic(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Eye of the Beholder</title>
    <desc lang="en">Part high-tech spy thriller and part psychological study, Eye of the Beholder was Ewan McGregor's first feature film following his mainstream breakthrough performance in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. The Eye (Ewan McGregor) is an agent of the British Secret Service, equipped with the latest in high-tech crime fighting gadgetry and assisted by his indefatigable collegue, Hilary (k.d. lang). The Eye's latest assignment is a surveillance project; the son of a well-known politician has been spending a great deal of money on someone, and they would like to know who and why. A little sleuthing reveals that the mysterious person taking the cash is a woman named Joanna (Ashley Judd), but the trail gets much stickier when the Eye witnesses Joanna pulling a knife and killing the politician's son. Normally, he'd take the shortcut to putting her behind bars, but some time ago he lost contact with his daughter when his wife left him; Joanna reminds the Eye of his daughter, and he's too fascinated with her to bring her to justice. The Eye now follows Joanna obsessively, and discovers that she's also involved with a blind man (Patrick Bergin) and has a history of emotional instability from being abandoned by her father at a young age. Eye of the Beholder was directed by Stephan Elliott, best known for the comedy The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">When a nefarious villain named Ultron emerges to threaten mankind, the next generation of superheroes leaps into action and prepares to make their famous parents proud. It's been decades since Ultron defeated the original Avengers, and these days even the few folks that had held out hope for the future are finally ready to admit defeat. But Tony Stark has a surprise up his sleeve in the form of four amazing teenagers who just might have the power to defeat Ultron once and for all. But will James (son of Captain America and Black Widow), Pym (son of Wasp and Giant Man), Torunn (daughter of Thor) and Azari (son of the Black Panther) truly be capable of defeating the villain who brought about the downfall of their powerful parents? As the battle gets underway and Hawkeye's sharp-shooting son leaps into the fray, the team realizes that they might stand a fighting chance if they can only track down the mission Hulk and encourage him to become a member of the team.

    <desc lang="en">Rapper and actor Ice Cube shows off his softer side in this family-friendly comedy. Nick Persons (Ice Cube) is a dealer in sports collectibles who has fallen for beautiful executive Suzanne Kingston (Nia Long). However, Nick discovers he has a bigger task than just winning her over -- Suzanne is a divorced mother with two children, Lindsey (Aleisha Allen) and Kevin (Philip Daniel Bolden), and the kids don't believe any man besides their father is fit for their mother to date. Even though Nick doesn't care much for kids, he's eager to win Lindsey and Kevin over to score points with Suzanne, and so when business commitments threaten to strand Suzanne in Vancouver without her children for New Year's Eve, Nick volunteers to escort them. But when Nick is bumped from an airline flight due to a corkscrew in his pocket, he's forced to drive the kids to Canada, and Lindsey and Kevin see this as a golden opportunity to make life very difficult for Nick. Ice Cube served as both star and producer for this project(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</title>
    <desc lang="en">New Zealand filmmaker Peter Jackson fulfills his lifelong dream of transforming author J.R.R. Tolkien's best-selling fantasy epic into a three-part motion picture that begins with this holiday 2001 release. Elijah Wood stars as Frodo Baggins, a Hobbit resident of the medieval "Middle-earth" who discovers that a ring bequeathed to him by beloved relative and benefactor Bilbo (Ian Holm) is in fact the "One Ring," a device that will allow its master to manipulate dark powers and enslave the world. Frodo is charged by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) to return the ring to Mount Doom, the evil site where it was forged millennia ago and the only place where it can be destroyed. Accompanying Frodo is a fellowship of eight others: his Hobbit friends Sam (Sean Astin), Merry (Dominic Monaghan), and Pippin (Billy Boyd); plus Gandalf; the human warriors Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and Boromir (Sean Bean); Elf archer Legolas (Orlando Bloom); and Dwarf soldier Gimli (John Rhys-Davies). The band's odyssey to the dreaded land of Mordor, where Mount Doom lies, takes them through the Elfish domain of Rivendell and the forest of Lothlorien, where they receive aid and comfort from the Elf princess Arwen (Liv Tyler), her father, Elrond (Hugo Weaving), and Queen Galadriel (Cate Blanchett). In pursuit of the travelers and their ring are Saruman (Christopher Lee) -- a traitorous wizard and kin, of sorts, to Gandalf -- and the Dark Riders, under the control of the evil, mysterious Sauron (Sala Baker). The Fellowship must also do battle with a troll, flying spies, Orcs, and other deadly obstacles both natural and otherwise as they draw closer to Mordor. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) was filmed in Jackson's native New Zealand, closely followed by its pair of sequels, The Two Towers (2002) and The Return of the King (2003)(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Mr. Plow. After Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) totals both family cars in an accident following an evening drinking at Moe's Tavern, he's in the market for a new vehicle, and decides to visit the Springfield Auto Show to see what's available. Homer is fast talked into buying an expensive four-wheel-drive truck with a snowplow attachment, but he's convinced he can make the truck pay for itself by renting out his services plowing driveways. Homer throws together a low-budget television commercial advertising his "Mr. Plow" service, and after a snowstorm hits Springfield, business is quickly booming. However, Homer's booze-infused best friend Barney Gumble (also voiced by Castellaneta) feels like he's not accomplishing much compared to his pal, and Homer encourages Barney to make something of himself by following his example. Barney follows his advice all too closely -- he buys a snowplow of his own, dubs himself "The Plow King," persuades his old friend Linda Rondstat to sing a jingle in his commercial, and soon drives off with nearly all of Homer's customers. Homer is more than a bit disappointed with Barney, turning old friends into bitter rivals. "Mr. Plow" also features a guest appearance from Batman star Adam West at the Auto Show; the episode first aired on November 19, 1992(n)</desc>

Neurotic con man Roy (Nicolas Cage) suffers from several emotional problems, including obsessive-compulsive disorder. He and his partner Frank (Sam Rockwell) swindle people out of money by posing as money collectors who promise things like tax refunds, package vacations, and other fabulous prizes (which they never get). Frank wants to pull a really big job, but Roy is too consumed with fear and panic attacks to join him. Only cigarettes and his trusty illegal prescription drugs seem to keep him going. When Roy finds himself in desperate need of more pills, he is forced to see legitimate psychotherapist Dr. Klein (Bruce Altman). Roy ends up talking about his emotional damage from a troubled marriage and divorce, which results in the discovery of a child whom he has never met. Dr. Klein suggests that he spend a weekend with the kid, so in walks teenaged Angela (played by twentysomething Alison Lohman).

Neurotic con man Roy (Nicolas Cage) suffers from several emotional problems, including obsessive-compulsive disorder. He and his partner Frank (Sam Rockwell) swindle people out of money by posing as money collectors who promise things like tax refunds, package vacations, and other fabulous prizes (which they never get). Frank wants to pull a really big job, but Roy is too consumed with fear and panic attacks to join him. Only cigarettes and his trusty illegal prescription drugs seem to keep him going. When Roy finds himself in desperate need of more pills, he is forced to see legitimate psychotherapist Dr. Klein (Bruce Altman). Roy ends up talking about his emotional damage from a troubled marriage and divorce, which results in the discovery of a child whom he has never met. Dr. Klein suggests that he spend a weekend with the kid, so in walks teenaged Angela (played by twentysomething Alison Lohman). Reluctant to develop his role as a father, Roy also gets heavily involved in Frank's ambitious swindle(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The wind whispers ominous warnings of death before a malevolent entity arrives to claim the life of a young girl as director Courtney Solomon brings author Brent Monahan's chilling, fact-based story of supernatural murder to the screen in this tale of terror starring Donald Sutherland and Sissy Spacek. The year is 1818 and the Bell family is a quiet clan residing on a remote farm in Red River, TN. A normal, loving family by all accounts, the uneventful lives of the Bell family begin to take a dark turn when strange noises around the farm are followed by the arrival of a black wolf with piercing yellow eyes said to strike unspeakable fear into the very soul of all who encounter it. As the sadistic spirit singles out the youngest daughter of the Bell family for torment and her frightened parents search frantically for a rational explanation to the chilling events unfolding in their once-happy home, an eerie, disembodied voice promises death from beyond the grave. With the struggle rapidly turning violent and the Bells' desperate prayers for mercy going unanswered time and again, the shocking murder that followed would prove the only case in recorded American history where the death of a human being was directly attributed to an attack by an evil entity or spirit(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">(2009) Jaume Collet-Serra's stylish, disturbing psychological thriller centres on the ill-fated family life of Kate and John Coleman (Vera Farmiga and Peter Saarsgard). Following the stillbirth of their third child, recovering alcoholic Kate and former philanderer John's marriage is feeling the strain. To get things back on track, the couple decide to adopt nine-year-old Russian orphan Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman), whose life has also been dogged by tragedy. But, not long after the precocious girl's arrival in the family unit, a series of difficult-to-explain 'accidents' gives Kate and John good reason to question the wisdom of their decision. Then things really start to spiral out of control... Some sections in Estonian with English subtitles. Edited for violence. M,W,R,S,,HD(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Jerry Maguire</title>
    <desc lang="en">Taking a refreshing approach to an old story, this romantic comedy is one of those rare Hollywood features that contains a little something for almost everyone: sports, romance, humor, satire, a touch of pathos, insight and even some subtle drama. At the onset, Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) is a busy and highly successful manager of 72 noted sports personalities. Like most of Sports Management International's top employees, he is ruthlessly ambitious and greedy. He spends most of his time zooming across the country trying to figure out ways to promote his clients--not to help them, but to make money for his employer. But late one night in yet another faceless hotel, something inside Jerry snaps. Hastily, he pens a fiery letter titled "The Things We Think and Do Not Say: The Future of Our Business," a passionate call to start caring more for the clients than the revenue they generate. The memo nets Jerry a standing ovation from his peers, but his bosses are not impressed and soon afterward, Jerry gets canned. As he walks out, he asks others to join him, but only one lowly accountant, Dorothy(Renee Zellweger), dares show solidarity. For her, a widow with a small son, it is a strong sign of her quiet devotion to his cause. All of his clients but Rod Tidwell, the wide receiver for the Arizona Cardinals desert him. So does his equally ruthless fiance Avery Bishop. Still, Jerry is determined to reassemble his life and so begins wooing promising college draft pick Frank Cushman, a young quarterback with real star potential. He also begins looking carefully at Dorothy. She and her son live with her caustic older sister Laurel. Despite the obstacles presented by Laurel and her divorced friends, Dorothy and Jerry begin a tentative relationship that goes well until they reach a final obstacle, one that could have lasting consequences for her little boy(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">"A Few Good Men" is based on the successful Broadway drama, a critically acclaimed story of a Navy lawyer's unrelenting quest to uncover the truth during a military trial. Two young Marines stand accused of murdering a member of their platoon during an unsanctioned disciplinary action known as a "Code Red". The Navy, in an effort to obtain a quick and quiet plea bargain, appoints Lieutenant J.G.Daniel Kaffee, a young, second generation Navy lawyer, to defend the accused Marines. Less than fifteen months out of Harvard Law School, Kaffee has earned a reputation for his glibness and facility to plea bargain. Though possessed of a brilliant legal mind Kaffee is more interested in softball games than in the hardball game of law. At first the game appears routine: On the U.S. Naval Base located at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, two Marines conduct a seemingly unauthorised punishment on a fellow Marine who has broken the chain of command by writing a letter to an off-base authority, threatening to report one of them for an illegal shooting over the fenceline in exchange for a transfer(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Jerry Maguire</title>
    <desc lang="en">Taking a refreshing approach to an old story, this romantic comedy is one of those rare Hollywood features that contains a little something for almost everyone: sports, romance, humor, satire, a touch of pathos, insight and even some subtle drama. At the onset, Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) is a busy and highly successful manager of 72 noted sports personalities. Like most of Sports Management International's top employees, he is ruthlessly ambitious and greedy. He spends most of his time zooming across the country trying to figure out ways to promote his clients--not to help them, but to make money for his employer. But late one night in yet another faceless hotel, something inside Jerry snaps. Hastily, he pens a fiery letter titled "The Things We Think and Do Not Say: The Future of Our Business," a passionate call to start caring more for the clients than the revenue they generate. The memo nets Jerry a standing ovation from his peers, but his bosses are not impressed and soon afterward, Jerry gets canned.

    <desc lang="en">Matt Tebbutt, Kate Quilton and Jimmy Doherty present a festive edition of the food investigation series, making their way through the various courses of a standard Christmas dinner to identify surprising, cost-effective alternatives to yuletide staples. They begin with a smoked salmon starter, revealing why some cuts are priced higher than others, before moving on to explain why goose - actually a more traditional alternative to turkey - is so expensive. The team reveals why an almond shortage this year might threaten supplies of a favourite after-dinner treat, the marzipan-covered Christmas cake, and highlights a cheaper substitute that tastes just as nice, but is made from something that would normally be thrown in the bin.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">World Without Men. Welcome to Lee Arrendale State Prison, Georgias largest facility for women. From minor offenders to murderers, almost 1600 offenders make their home here, some for a few weeks … some for the rest of their lives. Here, society takes on a life of its own, with drugs, hustles and illegal sexual relationships making up much of the world behind bars. In this episode, we meet inmates all trying to find the right way to do their time in the extreme world of prison. This episode looks at four very different inmates and how their time has affected their behavior, their senses of self, and their future: from a prison stud, to a changed lifer, to a manipulator of the system. With each story, we see that learning to do time is an ongoing process; its a matter of knowing who you are, and in the extremes of prison life, who you are willing to become(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The documentary series telling the stories of people who were manipulated into horrific situation concludes with the tale of Sarah Rose, who fell under the sway of a mysterious spiritual guru known as `Master David'. Preaching an appealing blend of Hinduism, Christianity and mysticism, `Master David' tells his followers he'll purify their souls, and persuaded quiet librarian Sarah Rose to abandon her family and friends to live a chaotic life on the road with him. However, what initially began as a spiritual quest soon became marked by brutal violence, and when the guru she had worshipped began to make her fear for her life, Sarah Rose finally escaped in the hope of bringing justice to her tormentor.(n)</desc>

Andy Hawkins (Dermot Mulroney). Space travel is no child's game, however, and Jimmy, a bright young astrophysics whiz, knows that both of his parents have serious reservations about his deep-rooted desire to follow in his father's footsteps. After furtively applying to win a seat on the next space shuttle, Jimmy learns that he has been accepted into a prestigious space camp run by Col. Roy Manley (Josh Lucas). Once there, Jimmy and a team of teens called the Warriors enter into a heated rivalry against the highly competitive Titans. The Warriors are just about to admit defeat when an emergency aboard the International Space Station leaves three astronauts isolated and alone hundreds of miles above Earth. With the fates of the helpless astronauts hanging in the balance, Jimmy and his team hatch an innovative rescue plan that impresses Commander Phillips (Danny Glover), and offers newfound hope for the future of space exploration(n)</desc>

For as far back as he can remember, Jimmy Hawkins (Thomas Horn) has dreamed of exploring the stars and visiting the International Space Station, just like his father, retired NASA astronaut Capt. Andy Hawkins (Dermot Mulroney). Space travel is no child's game, however, and Jimmy, a bright young astrophysics whiz, knows that both of his parents have serious reservations about his deep-rooted desire to follow in his father's footsteps. After furtively applying to win a seat on the next space shuttle, Jimmy learns that he has been accepted into a prestigious space camp run by Col. Roy Manley (Josh Lucas). Once there, Jimmy and a team of teens called the Warriors enter into a heated rivalry against the highly competitive Titans. The Warriors are just about to admit defeat when an emergency aboard the International Space Station leaves three astronauts isolated and alone hundreds of miles above Earth. With the fates of the helpless astronauts hanging in the balance, Jimmy and his team hatch an innovative rescue plan that impresses Commander Phillips (Danny Glover), and offers newfound hope for the future of space exploration(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">I, Robot</title>
    <desc lang="en">Set just three decades into the future, Alex Proyas's all-action science-fiction film is inspired by Isaac Asimov's 1950s short story. The science of robotics is so advanced that humanoid-looking servants have been developed, ready to obey any command from a human.

    <desc lang="en">Set just three decades into the future, Alex Proyas's all-action science-fiction film is inspired by Isaac Asimov's 1950s short story. The science of robotics is so advanced that humanoid-looking servants have been developed, ready to obey any command from a human. When the chief designer of US Robotics, the biggest manufacturer of this new brand, is found dead in the company's atrium after a fall from the upper floor, it has all the hallmarks of suicide, and Chicago cop Del Spooner is assigned to the case. But technophobe Spooner doesn't believe that all robots are harmless. Despite opposition from both his superiors and the company, he investigates further and soon his suspicions centre on one robot, Sonny.

    <title lang="en">Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers</title>
    <desc lang="en">Picking up six years after the events of Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers, this competently produced but ultimately disappointing sequel attempts to tie up the uneven horror series' loose ends with a less-than-convincing resolution. This installment opens with Jamie Lloyd (J.C. Brandy), young niece of supernatural psycho-killer Michael Myers, giving birth on an altar amid a mysterious Druid ceremony. Before she is killed by her monstrous uncle, Jamie manages to leave her baby in the care of young Tommy Doyle (Paul Rudd), who has pursued a lifelong obsession with the horrific Myers family legacy in the town of Haddonfield, IL. Living with members of the Strode family, Tommy comes to suspect that one of them, little Danny Strode (Devin Gardner), is cursed with the same malevolent power that drove Michael to murder several members of his family. When Michael arrives in Haddonfield to find and destroy Jamie's baby, Tommy joins forces with Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence), Michael's ex-psychiatrist and a life-long crusader against his sinister former patient, to find the connection between Michael and the Man in Black and end the curse once and for all. Released shortly after Pleasence's death, this confusing, horribly edited blend of tired slasher clichés and X-Files-inspired subplots is a poor testament to the long career of the distinguished and compelling character actor(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Driver and muscle for hire Frank Martin returns in this sequel to the 2002 box-office hit. Frank Martin (Jason Statham) is a former special-forces officer who will transport anything anywhere for a price, and his latest assignment is acting as chauffeur for Jack Billings (Hunter Clary), the young son of politician Jefferson Billings (Matthew Modine), who has garnered no small amount of controversy for his aggressive efforts to stamp out the trade in illegal drugs. One day, Frank is to take Jack to the doctor for a checkup while his mother, Audrey (Amber Valletta), sets up a birthday party for the tyke. However, Jack's doctor is not who he appears to be -- he's actually Dimitri (Jason Flemyng), a Russian agent well versed in viruses who works with criminal kingpin Gianni (Alessandro Gassman). After a long and hard-fought chase with Frank, the bad guys get ahold of little Jack and hold him for ransom. The parents comply with their monetary demands and soon have their son back at home -- but little do they know that the boy has secretly been injected with a deadly and easily spread virus, which the terrorists hope to spread to the boy's powerful father and other politicians whom Jefferson will soon be addressing at a public event. When Frank learns what has happened to young Jack, he sets out to find the culprits -- and the antidote that will save the boy and all others who have been exposed to the virus from dying a painful death -- though his foes have stacked the deck so that it looks as if Frank has been complicit in the crime(n)</desc>

He is looked after by a secretary (Judy Davis) who has been acting as a ghost writer for an alcoholic screenwriter (John Mahoney, playing a character based on William Faulkner). Also keeping tabs on Fink is a garrulous traveling salesman (John Goodman), the most likeable, stable character in the picture. And then comes the plot twist to end all plot twists, plunging Barton Fink into a surreal nightmare that would make Hieronymus Bosch look like a house painter. Once more, Ethan and Joel Coen serve up a smorgasbord of quirkiness and kinkiness, where nothing is what it seems and nothing turns out as planned(n)</desc>

Detective Emmett Fields (Luke Evans) was investigating a vicious murder when he realized the crime scene bore a striking resemblance to a mystery story that was just published in the local newspaper. The author of that ominous tale was Edgar Allan Poe, a brilliant young writer whose status as a social outcast catches the attention of the diligent detective. Shortly after Poe is questioned by the authorities, detectives stumble upon yet another murder scene that seems to have been inspired by the author's morbid writings. Convinced that the killer will once again use Poe's writings as a springboard to murder, Detective Fields recruits the reclusive author to help piece together a pattern to the crimes and stop the madman before he can strike again. Brendan Gleeson and Alice Eve co-star in this tense period thriller from director James McTeigue (V for Vendetta)(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Queen</title>
    <desc lang="en">The British prime minister and the Royal Family find themselves quietly at odds in the wake of a national tragedy in this drama from director Stephen Frears. On August 31, 1997, Diana, Princess of Wales died in an auto accident in Paris; despite the controversial breakup of her marriage to Prince Charles, she was still one of the most famous and best-loved women in the world, and the public outpouring of emotion over her passing was immediate and intense. However, given the messy circumstances of Diana's breakup with Charles, official spokespeople for the Royal Family were uncertain about how to publicly address her passing. It didn't take long for the media to pick up on the hesitation of Buckingham Palace to pay homage to Diana, and many saw this as a sign of the cool emotional distance so often attributed to the royals, which in this case was widely seen as an insult against Diana and the many people who loved her. Prime Minister Tony Blair (played by Michael Sheen) saw a potential public-relations disaster in the making, and took it upon himself to persuade Queen Elizabeth II (played by Helen Mirren) to make a statement in tribute to the fallen Diana -- an action that went against the taciturn queen's usual nature. The Queen was released the same year that Helen Mirren played Queen Elizabeth I in an acclaimed miniseries for British television; The Queen also gave Michael Sheen his second opportunity to play Tony Blair after portraying the prime minister in the television film The Deal(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Sleepless in Seattle</title>
    <desc lang="en">Inspired by the 1957 film An Affair to Remember, Sleepless in Seattle is a light romantic comedy about a recently-engaged journalist named Annie (Meg Ryan) who sets out on a cross-country trip to meet Sam (Tom Hanks) after hearing his son's phone call to a radio talk show. Though she has never met Sam, Annie is convinced by his son's plea, for his father to find a new wife, that she is destined to be his lover. Nora Ephron's script is light and engaging, full of fine, gentle jokes, while both Ryan and Hanks give thoroughly winning performances, as does Rosie O'Donnell as Ryan's best friend, Becky(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Sunshine Cleaning</title>
    <desc lang="en">A thirtysomething single mother whose boundless potential was squandered through a series of failed relationships and a misguided effort to help her younger sister succeed in life finds the fruits of her labors finally coming together in director Christine Jeffs' dark family comedy. Back in high school, the future looked pretty bright for Rose Lorkowski (Amy Adams); not only was she the cheerleading captain, but she was also dating the star quarterback. Flash forward a little over a decade, and Rose is working overtime in hopes of getting her son into a better school. Her sister, Norah (Emily Blunt), is still living at home with their father, Joe (Alan Arkin), a failed salesman whose penchant for jumping into get-rich-quick schemes has left the family without a financial net to fall back on. Rose may be down, but she certainly isn't out, and when she hatches a plan to launch a crime-scene cleanup business, the money starts rolling in. Sure, cleaning up murder scenes and suicide sites may not be the most glamorous job in the world, but death is a fairly profitable business, and as the phone keeps ringing, Rose and Norah finally begin to experience the closeness of sisterhood that has eluded them all these years while also providing their family with true security(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Bull Durham</title>
    <desc lang="en">A blend of comedy, drama and romance, Bull Durham follows the intertwining of three lives brought together by the great American pastime. Crash Davis (Kevin Costner, showcasing his Midwestern charm) is a perennial Minor Leaguer assigned to the Durham Bulls, a hapless team with a long tradition of mediocrity. There he tutors a young, dim-witted pitching prodigy, Nuke LaLoosh (Tim Robbins) in the ways of baseball, life, and love. Each strikes up a romance with Annie (Susan Sarandon), the team's "mascot" who takes it upon herself to sleep with a new player every season. Each has his/her own conflict: Crash struggles to end his career with some measure of dignity; Nuke struggles to make it to the "big show"; and Annie struggles to find something more than a roll in the hay -- and of course, Crash and Nuke come into conflict over Annie's affections to further complicate matters. The film treats the sport of baseball with a sort of casual reverence, highlighting both the drama and the humor inherent in the game, illustrated by Annie's numerous references to baseball as "her religion."(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Gabrielle Union, Morris Chestnut, Queen Latifah, and Terrence Howard star in a film concerning a young girl who implores a department-store Santa to find a new husband for her divorced mother for Christmas. Single mother of three Nancy (Union) has been putting the needs of her three children ahead of her own for as far back as she can remember, and lately her youngest daughter, Emily (Khail Bryant), has become acutely aware of her mother's palpable sadness. As Christmas draws near, Nancy takes her kids to the mall for a cheerful visit with jolly old Saint Nick. When it comes time for Emily's turn to sit on Santa's lap and make her Christmas wish, she selflessly remembers her mother's recent comment that a compliment from a man would be the best gift of all. Determined to make her mother happy again even if it means sacrificing her own wish, Emily relays the message to Santa (Chestnut), not realizing that the man beneath the beard is actually an office-supply salesman and ambitious singer/songwriter named Benjamin. Recognizing the daughter's love for her mother and sensing something truly special in Nancy, Benjamin cheerfully obliges the young girl, setting into motion a series of events that promise to make this the most memorable holiday in quite some time.

Determined to make her mother happy again even if it means sacrificing her own wish, Emily relays the message to Santa (Chestnut), not realizing that the man beneath the beard is actually an office-supply salesman and ambitious singer/songwriter named Benjamin. Recognizing the daughter's love for her mother and sensing something truly special in Nancy, Benjamin cheerfully obliges the young girl, setting into motion a series of events that promise to make this the most memorable holiday in quite some time. Lance Rivera directs a film produced by Shakim Compere and Latifah through Flavor Unit Entertainment(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Hotel Rwanda</title>
    <desc lang="en">Hotel Rwanda tackles one of the most horrifically ugly events in recent history, when the Hutu extremists of Rwanda initiated a terrifying campaign of genocide, massacring hundreds of thousands of minority Tutsis (who had been given power by the departed Belgian colonists), while the rest of the world looked on and did nothing. Don Cheadle stars as Paul Rusesabagina, the hotel manager at the fancy Les Milles Collines hotel in Kigali. Paul is a Hutu, and a very successful businessman who smoothly greases the wheels, making powerful connections in all strata of Rwandan life. His wife, Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo of Aeon Flux), is a Tutsi. She urges Paul to use his influence to help local Tutsis, who are being harassed and beaten with increasing frequency, but Paul will only use the political capital he's built up to help his own family, if and when they need it. Soon enough, the violence escalates, and the Hutus begin their genocide of the Tutsis. European guests and staff at the hotel are flown out of the country, and Paul is left in charge. He finds that his conscience won't allow him to watch as the innocent are slaughtered, and before long, the hotel has become a well-appointed refugee camp. Paul is seen as a traitor by some, putting his life in danger, and the predicament of his "guests" grows more precarious every day, but despite good intentions on the part of a journalist (Joaquin Phoenix) and a UN peacekeeping colonel (Nick Nolte), the rest of the world is not eager to intervene and stop the massacre. Hotel Rwanda was directed by Irish filmmaker Terry George (Some Mother's Son), who co-wrote the script with Keir Pearson(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Robert Stromberg's Maleficent stars Angelina Jolie stars as the title character, who, as a teenager, is a powerful and respected winged fairy helping to rule a magical land full of strange creatures. Her homeland borders a country that is populated by humans and run by the cruel King Henry (Kenneth Cranham). One day, a farm boy named Stefan (Jackson Bews) traipses into the fairy's land and meets Maleficent, causing the two crazy teens to fall into forbidden love. Year later, Henry seeks to take over the magical land next to his kingdom, but is thwarted in battle by Maleficent. Eager for revenge, he offers his daughter's hand in marriage to whoever can stop the fairy, and the now-grown Stefan (played as an adult by Sharlto Copley) succeeds by betraying her and clipping her wings. In response, an infuriated Maleficent swears revenge on Stefan; she gets her chance when he becomes king himself and has his first child, a daughter named Aurora (Elle Fanning) -- as Sleeping Beauty fans will remember, Maleficent curses her to fall into a death-like sleep after pricking her finger on a spinning wheel on her 16th birthday. Stefan demands that all of the spinning wheels be collected, and orders his daughter to be secretly raised in the woods by three good-hearted but dim-witted fairies, who will return her to him the day after her 16th birthday. However, Maleficent refuses to stay away from Aurora and ends up developing maternal feelings for the girl, eventually inspiring her to try to undo the curse she placed upon the princess(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Heartbreak Kid</title>
    <desc lang="en">(1972) Father Ted Night is rounded off by the influential American film The Heartbreak Kid , starring Charles Grodin, Jeannie Berlin and Cybill Shepherd, which both Graham Linehan and Arthur Mathews cite as a major influence on their comedy writing. Elaine May's romantic tragic-comedy stars Grodin as Lenny Cantrow, newly married to Lila (Berlin). En route to their honeymoon in Miami, he's already beginning to have second doubts after seeing her eat an egg mayo sandwich and hearing her sing the same song over again. At the resort, disaster strikes when Lila gets sunburnt and is confined to their room. Lenny, alone on the beach, suddenly spies Kelly Corcoran (Shepherd) and falls for her on the spot. Dumping Lila, he pursues Kelly to her home in Minnesota and wins her heart. But he soon learns that not everything beautiful is perfect and that people are not just commodities to be cast aside on a whim. Premiere(n)</desc>
