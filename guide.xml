    <title lang="en">Dragonfly</title>
    <desc lang="en">Joe Darrow works as a doctor in the emergency room of Chicago Memorial Hospital. His wife, Emily Darrow, was last seen in a rainstorm in Venezuela, where she was on a retreat with the Red Cross offering humanitarian aid. She vanished in a bus accident. There were no survivors and her body was never found. That rich, green, exotic land is left behind as Joe is challenged to persevere through sad, rainy days back home. Joe promised Emily that if anything ever happened to her, he would visit her patients in the oncology ward. Strangely, the children seem to know him, and they say they've seen Emily in their near-death experiences. Joe starts to believe that his wife is using the near-death experiences of her terminal patients to communicate with him, through images the children report seeing in their dreams, and symbols they are inexplicably compelled to draw. While the children see Joe as a kindred spirit, the hospital staff worries about how these interactions are agitating them. At home, Joe begins finding other ethereal evidence of his wife's attempt to contact him from beyond the grave, some of it featuring the image of a dragonfly, which was the shape of the birthmark on her shoulder. His friends and a caring neighbor (Kathy Bates) worry that Joe is losing his marbles, especially as his quest becomes more frantic, putting his job in jeopardy(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Fido</title>
    <desc lang="en">In a 1950s-era alternate universe where domesticated zombies play a functional role in society by delivering the milk, carrying the mail, and even helping out with household chores, one boy is about to find out just how big of a personal responsibility "pet" ownership truly is. When the Earth passed through a cloud of space dust and the dead arose from their graves to devour the flesh of the living, it first seemed that all hope for humanity was lost. Society's rapid slide into chaos, however, was soon halted when scientists at a company called ZomCom created a special collar that turned the rampaging animated corpses docile. Now, thanks to ZomCom, everything is under control -- or is it? Timmy Robinson (K'Sun Ray) isn't quite convinced. Quiet and withdrawn, the skeptical young boy spends so much time locked away in his room that he's almost become invisible around the household. His mother Helen (Carrie-Anne Moss) has recently purchased a zombie to help keep things tidy around the house though, and when the creature attempts to engage the curious youngster in a game of catch, a friendship is forged between boy and zombie that finds the amiable gut-muncher nicknamed Fido (Billy Connolly) practically becoming a part of the family. Things take a turn for the worse however, when Fido's collar malfunctions and Timmy's neighbors begin dying in droves. When ZomCom's top zombie control specialist Mr. Bottoms (Henry Czerny) moves in across the street from Timmy, the increasingly complicated situation threatens to place a serious stumbling block in the path of human-zombie relations(n)</desc>

Twenty-two-year-old Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) may not have a job, but rocking the bass for his band, Sex Bob-omb, is a tough job unto itself. When Scott locks eyes with Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), he knows she's the girl he wants to grow old with. But Ramona has some serious baggage; her supercharged exes rue the thought of her being with another man, and they'll crush any guy who gives her a second glance. Now, in order to win Ramona's heart, Scott will do battle with everyone from vegan-powered rock gods to sinister skateboarders, never losing sight of his gorgeous goal as he pummels his way to victory. Shaun of the Dead's Edgar Wright directs the film from a script he penned with Michael Bacall. Superhero veterans Chris Evans and Brandon Routh co-star in the action comedy as two of the seven ex-boyfriends(n)</desc>

Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) is a rare book broker who makes his living tracking down valuable items for rich bibliophiles. Corso is hired by Boris Balkan (Frank Langella), a millionaire New Yorker with a vast collection of occult literature and a keen interest in "The Nine Gates to the Kingdom of Shadows." Legend has it that the book was co-written by Satan in the 17th century, and only three copies are known to exist; the owner of one recently sold the book to Balkan a few days before killing himself. Balkan wants Corso to find the other two copies (one owned by a Mr. Fargas in Portugal and the other by a French collector named Kessler) and examine them to determine if they are forgeries. Corso is told to be thorough and spare no expense. He begins by visiting Liana Telfer (Lena Olin), the widow of the man who once owned Balkan's copy of the book, who has an unusually strong desire to get the book back, and confers with his friend Bernie (James Russo), who soon turns up dead, in a manner much like an illustration from the book. Corso learns that the book contains clues to a puzzle that will allow people to call up the devil, and certain people will stop at nothing to find the missing parts of the formula(n)</desc>

A mediocre student pampered by his mother, a failed artist and a loner, Hitler shirked military service in 1913. But Germany's defeat in World War I turned him into a rabid nationalist who soon became the mouthpiece of a small far-right group. When galloping inflation overtook Germany in 1924, he attempted a coup with his paramilitary Storm Troopers, but it was a terrible failure. Lucky to survive, Hitler was imprisoned and wrote Mein Kampf in his cell. When he was released he restarted his quest for power, this time by legal means.

By way of demonstration, the presenter goes to orang-utan school in Sumatra, visits Thailand to see long-tailed macaques floss their teeth with human hair and use tools to open oysters on the beach, and reveals how Ugandan chimpanzees pass on cultures and customs down the generations. He also meets a resourceful bonobo in the States that can order its own picnic on the phone and build a fire, on which it then toasts marshmallows.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Monty Halls reveals how the Great Barrier Reef is vitally linked to the rest of the planet in many ways. Creatures travel thousands of miles to visit, from tiger sharks, great whales and seabirds to the largest green-turtle gathering on Earth and rarely seen alien-like creatures, such as the tentacled nautilus. The reef is also affected by weather systems travelling from across the Pacific, including cyclones that bring destruction and chaos to the coral and the creatures that live on it.(n)</desc>

Mark Wahlberg stars as Chris Cole, a wannabe rock star who works by day as a copy machine repairman and by night as the lead singer of Blood Pollution, a Pennsylvania tribute band that imitates the best-selling heavy metal rockers of Steel Dragon. Although he's supported by his girlfriend Emily (Jennifer Aniston), Chris is devastated when his friends kick him out of the band he founded. His humiliation doesn't last long, however, as Chris soon learns that he's been tapped to replace the lead singer of Steel Dragon, literally becoming a rock star overnight. Chris soon has everything he's ever wanted but is disappointed to discover that being a superstar isn't everything it's cracked up to be. Rock Star was produced under two other titles, "Metal God" and "So You Want to Be a Rock Star."(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Fever Pitch</title>
    <desc lang="en">Nick Hornby's acclaimed memoir about one man's struggle to balance his love of a woman and his love for soccer was the basis of a well-reviewed British film in 1997, and now gets a Americanized rewrite with this picture, in which the game is changed from soccer to baseball. Ben (Jimmy Fallon) is a high-school teacher who meets Lindsay (Drew Barrymore), who has a successful career in business. Ben and Lindsay don't appear to have much in common on the surface, but they hit it off and are soon involved in a serious romance. But when spring rolls around, Lindsay becomes aware of the true love of Ben's life -- the Boston Red Sox. Despite the team's lamentable record, Ben has been a fiercely loyal Red Sox fan since childhood, and Lindsay finds it hard to compete with his passion for baseball, while Ben is forced to choose between the obsessions of his youth and the enthusiasms of a responsible adult. Fever Pitch was shot in part in Boston during the 2004 baseball season, which to the surprise of the filmmakers saw the Red Sox winning baseball's world series for the first time since 1918(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Gladiator duo Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe re-team for this adaptation of author Peter Mayle's best-selling novel about a London-based investment banker who relocates to Provence in hopes of selling a small vineyard he has inherited from his recently deceased uncle. As a child, Max Skinner (Freddie Highmore) was taught to appreciate the finer things in life while wandering the vineyard estate of his sophisticated uncle Henry (Albert Finney). Life has a strange way or turning out how you least expect it to though, and 25 years later, Max (Russell Crowe) is now a prosperous moneyman wheeling and dealing in the cutthroat world of London business. When Max learns that Henry has recently passed away and that he has been named the sole beneficiary of his late uncle's modest estate, the keen businessman hastily arranges a flight to France in order to assess the value of the old property and get it prepped for sale. After Max arrives to find the vineyard in a crumbling state of disrepair, his troubles are further compounded by the stubbornness of gruff estate winemaker M. Duflot (Didier Bourdon) and the unexpected arrival of a determined California beauty named Christie (Abbie Cornish), who presents herself as a long-lost cousin while making a dubious claim to Henry's estate. Meanwhile, the overstressed Max reluctantly finds himself falling for local café owner and town siren Fanny (Marion Cotillard), whose formidable guard is quickly worn down by the smitten beneficiary(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Flyboys</title>
    <desc lang="en">As World War I rages in Europe and Allied forces in France, Italy, and England find their resolve quickly diminishing due to the overwhelming force of the German juggernaut, a handful of brave American soldiers volunteer to join their French counterparts in learning to fly and fighting for freedom from above as the true story of the legendary Lafayette Escadrille comes to the screen in a breathtaking war adventure from Academy Award-winning director Tony Bill and famed producer Dean Devlin. They have come from all over the United States, ready and willing to put their lives on the line despite their country's initial pledge to not get involved with the all-consuming war that rages throughout Europe. Few could have foreseen the challenges faced by the world's first fighter pilots, however, and upon arriving at their aerodrome in France, the aspiring aviators are assigned to a new squadron under the command of war-ravaged Captain Thenault (Jean Reno) and battle-weary American pilot Reed Cassidy -- the sole survivor of his devastated former air brigade. With little encouragement from their fellow aviators and nothing to drive but their unifying goal of taking to the skies and offering up their lives in the name of freedom, the determined airmen of the Lafayette Escadrille set out to make history by embarking on the adventure of a lifetime. James Franco, Martin Henderson, and David Ellison star in a script penned by Phil Sears, Blake T. Evans, and David S. Ward(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Operation: Endgame</title>
    <desc lang="en">A satirical workplace comedy with a slick action twist, Fouad Mikati's Operation: Endgame explores the violence that erupts when the organization charged with protecting America implodes, and the employees turn their guns on each other instead of their enemies. Somewhere beneath Washington, D.C., an intense rivalry is heating up between two opposing teams of government assassins. The hired killers in the organizations take their names from Tarot cards. The Fool (Joe Anderson) is the latest recruit. Reporting for his first day on the job, The Fool is shocked to find that his boss is dead, and the office is on lockdown. To make matters worse, the building has been rigged with explosives, and it's going to blow soon. Now, in order to get out alive, The Fool will have to root out the killer in his midst, and make a quick escape before his co-workers catch him in their crosshairs. Ellen Barkin, Zach Galifianakis, Rob Corddry, and Jeffrey Tambor star(n)</desc>

They have come from all over the United States, ready and willing to put their lives on the line despite their country's initial pledge to not get involved with the all-consuming war that rages throughout Europe. Few could have foreseen the challenges faced by the world's first fighter pilots, however, and upon arriving at their aerodrome in France, the aspiring aviators are assigned to a new squadron under the command of war-ravaged Captain Thenault (Jean Reno) and battle-weary American pilot Reed Cassidy -- the sole survivor of his devastated former air brigade. With little encouragement from their fellow aviators and nothing to drive but their unifying goal of taking to the skies and offering up their lives in the name of freedom, the determined airmen of the Lafayette Escadrille set out to make history by embarking on the adventure of a lifetime. James Franco, Martin Henderson, and David Ellison star in a script penned by Phil Sears, Blake T. Evans, and David S. Ward(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Solomon Kane</title>
    <desc lang="en">James Purefoy stars as a 16th-century antihero in this entertaining action fantasy, based on character created by Conan the Barbarian writer Robert E Howard. At the beginning, Solomon Kane is essentially a West Country bandit who cares little about the degree of violence employed in his pursuit of plunder. But he's given cause to reassess his chosen path while sacking a castle that, unbeknown to him, is allied to the Devil. Kane's men are slaughtered and a demonic creature tries to drag Kane's soul to Hell. Kane survives, but it's a Damascene moment: he repents and joins a monastery. Unfortunately, the monks don't want such a cursed soul in their midst and soon eject him. So Kane instead finds peace, happiness and worth with a hardworking Puritan family. But they too are attacked by the Devil's agents. Most of the family is killed and their daughter Meredith is abducted. So Kane dons his cape and capotain hat, picks up his guns and swords, and heads off on another bloody rampage. Only this time he's fighting for God and to rescue Meredith..(n)</desc>

The film opens as homicidal extraterrestrial Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement) escaping a 40-year incarceration in a secret high-security prison on the moon. Freshly liberated, Boris sets out for long-brooded-upon revenge on Agent K who shot off his arm when he was captured. Time-travelling to the late 1960s, Boris intends to avoid his amputation, wipe Agent K from history and lead Earth's invasion by his race. Thus Agent J must also head back in time to prevent his friend's younger self from meeting an untimely death and the rest of us from being conquered... With Emma Thompson as Agent O, J and K's boss, and Michael Stuhlbarg as Griffin, J's alien sidekick, who's capable of seeing every possible outcome in every situation(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Green Lantern</title>
    <desc lang="en">A test pilot embraces his destiny as a cosmic superhero in Casino Royale director Martin Campbell's adaptation of the popular DC Comics series. Ever since he saw his fearless father perish in a tragic aviation mishap, all Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds) could think about was flying -- it was the only thing the brash, cocky, and irresponsible test pilot ever truly excelled at. Little did he realize he was destined for something much bigger. Somewhere out in space, a powerful force of evil known as Parallax is spreading fear and destruction; the only hope for defeating Parallax is the Green Lantern Corps, a group of intergalactic warriors powered by the force of will. When legendary Green Lantern Abin Sur (Temuera Morrison) is sent hurtling toward planet Earth after a deadly encounter with Parallax, his ring chooses Hal to continue the fight. The ring spirits our hero away to the Green Lantern's home planet of Oa for training. The first human ever to receive the honor of becoming a Green Lantern, Hal is viewed with scorn by the league's leader, Sinestro (Mark Strong), who trains him alongside the hulking Kilowog (voice of Michael Clarke Duncan). Later, on planet Earth, frail scientist Hector Hammond (Peter Sarsgaard) becomes infected with Parallax's evil while performing an autopsy on Abin Sur, and uses his newfound powers to stake claim on Carol Ferris (Blake Lively), Hal's lifelong friend and fellow test pilot. When Hal learns that Parallax plans to consume all life on Earth to gain the energy needed to conquer Oa, he begins looking inward for the courage to defeat the malevolent force and embrace his destiny as a super-powered peacekeeper(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Green Lantern</title>
    <desc lang="en">A test pilot embraces his destiny as a cosmic superhero in Casino Royale director Martin Campbell's adaptation of the popular DC Comics series. Ever since he saw his fearless father perish in a tragic aviation mishap, all Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds) could think about was flying -- it was the only thing the brash, cocky, and irresponsible test pilot ever truly excelled at. Little did he realize he was destined for something much bigger. Somewhere out in space, a powerful force of evil known as Parallax is spreading fear and destruction; the only hope for defeating Parallax is the Green Lantern Corps, a group of intergalactic warriors powered by the force of will. When legendary Green Lantern Abin Sur (Temuera Morrison) is sent hurtling toward planet Earth after a deadly encounter with Parallax, his ring chooses Hal to continue the fight. The ring spirits our hero away to the Green Lantern's home planet of Oa for training. The first human ever to receive the honor of becoming a Green Lantern, Hal is viewed with scorn by the league's leader, Sinestro (Mark Strong), who trains him alongside the hulking Kilowog (voice of Michael Clarke Duncan). Later, on planet Earth, frail scientist Hector Hammond (Peter Sarsgaard) becomes infected with Parallax's evil while performing an autopsy on Abin Sur, and uses his newfound powers to stake claim on Carol Ferris (Blake Lively), Hal's lifelong friend and fellow test pilot. When Hal learns that Parallax plans to consume all life on Earth to gain the energy needed to conquer Oa, he begins looking inward for the courage to defeat the malevolent force and embrace his destiny as a super-powered peacekeeper(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A dystopian fantasy adventure based on an unusually faithful adaptation of the highly regarded graphic novel by Alan Moore, directed by Zach Snyder. It is 1985 and Richard Nixon continues his tenure in the White House, massively popular with the electorate following his crushing defeat of the Viet Cong. However, it seems that the American public have fallen out of love with their superheroes, one of whom, Dr Manhattan, was largely responsible for the winning the Vietnam War. Now, he and his fellow crime-fighters are regarded as reprehensible vigilantes and have been banned by law. But, when one of their number - the vile, ironically named Comedian - is murdered, the former heroes begin to re-emerge from the shadows to investigate. They discover that a terrifying plan is afoot... Also starring Matthew Goode, Malin Akerman, Patrick Wilson and Jackie Earle Haley(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A dystopian fantasy adventure based on an unusually faithful adaptation of the highly regarded graphic novel by Alan Moore, directed by Zach Snyder. It is 1985 and Richard Nixon continues his tenure in the White House, massively popular with the electorate following his crushing defeat of the Viet Cong. However, it seems that the American public have fallen out of love with their superheroes, one of whom, Dr Manhattan, was largely responsible for the winning the Vietnam War. Now, he and his fellow crime-fighters are regarded as reprehensible vigilantes and have been banned by law. But, when one of their number - the vile, ironically named Comedian - is murdered, the former heroes begin to re-emerge from the shadows to investigate. They discover that a terrifying plan is afoot... Also starring Matthew Goode, Malin Akerman, Patrick Wilson and Jackie Earle Haley(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Martin Lawrence Live: Runteldat</title>
    <desc lang="en">After a string of box-office failures, actor-comedian Martin Lawrence bares his soul -- and tells the stories behind some of his more troubling run-ins with the police, the media, and the movie industry -- in this feature-length stand-up performance film. Interspersing some behind-the-scenes documentary footage with a live recording of his packed-to-the-rafters concert at Washington, D.C.'s Constitution Hall in January, 2002, Martin Lawrence Live: Runteldat returns Lawrence to his roots: broad, bawdy, expletive-laden, slang-influenced monologues. But this time, the comedian's work takes on a personal slant, as he addresses the incident where he brandished a gun in a busy Los Angeles street during the filming of A Thin Line Between Love and Hate (1996), as well as the severe health problems he suffered just before cameras were ready to roll on what would be one of his biggest successes, Big Momma's House (2000). Martin Lawrence Live: Runteldat was produced by MTV Films, the company responsible for bringing 2000's four-man stand-up documentary Original Kings of Comedy to the screen; unlike Lawrence's previous performance film, the unrated You So Crazy, Runteldat was granted a "R" rating by the MPAA(n)</desc>

Teen Tracy Turnblad's regular cultural highlight is a local television music-and-dance programme called The Corny Collins Show. And, like all her friends, she dreams of having a chance to appear on it. However, this is Baltimore and it is 1962 - and Tracy's both overweight and, worse, has liberal attitudes to race relations, which don't sit comfortably with the segregationist views of the show's producer. But, could Tracy's ambitions for not only appearing on the show, but also racially integrating it, receive a fillip when she meets the son of Motormouth Maybelle, host of the monthly 'Negro Day' edition of the show? Also starring John Travolta (in drag and a fat-suit) as Tracy's mum, Christopher Walken, as her dad, and Amanda Bynes, James Marsden, Brittany Snow, Zac Efron and Elijah Kelley; plus cameos from the star of the original movie, Ricki Lake, and its director, John Waters(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Adam Shankman's adaptation of the 2002 musical (itself an adaptation of John Waters' 1988 original movie) stars John Travolta, Queen Latifah and Nikki Blonsky. Teen Tracy Turnblad's regular cultural highlight is a local television music-and-dance programme called The Corny Collins Show. And, like all her friends, she dreams of having a chance to appear on it. However, this is Baltimore and it is 1962 - and Tracy's both overweight and, worse, has liberal attitudes to race relations, which don't sit comfortably with the segregationist views of the show's producer. But, could Tracy's ambitions for not only appearing on the show, but also racially integrating it, receive a fillip when she meets the son of Motormouth Maybelle, host of the monthly 'Negro Day' edition of the show? Also starring John Travolta (in drag and a fat-suit) as Tracy's mum, Christopher Walken, as her dad, and Amanda Bynes, James Marsden, Brittany Snow, Zac Efron and Elijah Kelley; plus cameos from the star of the original movie, Ricki Lake, and its director, John Waters(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Rocker</title>
    <desc lang="en">(2008) This comedy from The Full Monty director Peter Cattaneo stars Rainn Wilson as a man whose life has well and truly fallen apart. Twenty years previously, Robert 'Fish' Fishman (Wilson) was heavy rock band Vesuvius's drummer. But when Vesuvius were offered a support slot for Whitesnake on the condition that they ditch their drummer, Fish found himself packing his sticks. Two decades later, he's been sacked from his dead-end job, ditched by his girlfriend and forced to move into his sister's attic. However, he unexpectedly - and unwittingly - gets another bite at stardom while preparing for a one-off gig with his 18-year-old nephew Josh's (Matt Gadman) band. The only place Fish can find to rehearse in is very stuffy and humid, so - because he's on his own - he chooses to play naked. But he doesn't realise he's being recorded. And when the clip is posted on the web it goes viral... Network Premiere. M,W,S,HD(n)</desc>

They still enjoy taunting each other at their favorite fishing lake. The fireworks really begin when they learn that the gorgeous and plucky Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) and her Italian mother have bought their beloved bait shop and plan to turn it into an Italian restaurant. The two devious fellows, hating the idea that anything should change in Wabasha, Minnesota, team up to keep that restaurant from opening, but Maria is having none of that nonsense and stands her ground. In the face of such feistiness, it is small wonder that Goldman finds himself falling in love, but will he succeed in subduing the equally stubborn Maria? Will he and Gustafson manage to maintain their tentative détente?(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Following up on her acclaimed debut, Clockwatchers, Jill Sprecher spins this intricate ensemble film about life's big questions. Set in New York City, the film focuses on five different characters with radically different perspectives on life. Gene (Alan Arkin) manages a large insurance company and is a compulsive pessimist, constantly bursting the bubbles of his more cheery colleagues. Walker (John Turturro), who holds a similarly bleak view of the world, decides that he cannot stand another day in his dull life as a physics professor and thus promptly dumps his wife, Patricia (Amy Irving). Troy (Matthew McConaughey) is an up-and-coming lawyer whose career is derailed after a hit-and-run accident. And Beatrice (Clea DuVall) is a modest cleaning woman hoping for a miracle. This film was screened at the 2001 Toronto Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Director/screenwriter David Gordon Green adapts Stewart O'Nan's popular novel to the screen in this feature, which tells the parallel tales of a teenager named Arthur (Michael Angarano) and his onetime babysitter Annie (Kate Beckinsale) -- whose turbulent relationship with her estranged husband, Glenn (Sam Rockwell), leads the small-town waitress down a troubled path. Arthur is a high-school student from a dysfunctional family, and does everything in his power to avoid hanging around the house while mom and dad quarrel. When he's not practicing his trombone and performing with the high-school marching band, Arthur can usually be found bussing tables at the local Chinese restaurant and flirting with older waitress Annie. Annie used to be Arthur's babysitter, and is currently struggling to separate from her former high-school sweetheart, Glenn. But being a single mother isn't easy, especially since the troubled Glenn wants nothing more than to clean up his act and reunite his family. Back at school, Arthur and pretty classmate Lila (Olivia Thirlby) have been bonding over their mutual love for all things geeky. Though the casual friendship shows promise of evolving into something more when Lila expresses her true feelings for Arthur, he can't help but becoming distracted by his chaotic family life: his father is moving out of the family home, and his mother is doing everything in her power to maintain some semblance of normalcy. Realizing that happiness is fleeting as his family becomes shattered and Annie experiences a series of distressing encounters with Glenn, Arthur gradually begins to fall for Lisa despite his growing cynicism concerning long-term relationships. Later, on a cold winter morning, Glenn and Annie's past catches up with them in a blinding flash, and the lives of everyone they know are suddenly and irrevocably changed(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">An average guy reacts to the frustration of losing his wife by adopting a crime-fighting persona known as the "Crimson Bolt," and targeting any criminal who crosses his path -- no matter how minor their infraction may be. Frank (Rainn Wilson) is husband to former alcoholic and drug addict Sarah (Liv Tyler), and he loves her with all his heart. Their wedding day was one of but two perfect moments in this Frank's life, but when Sarah runs away with charismatic drug dealer Jacques (Kevin Bacon), the loss was just too much for her mild-mannered husband to take. Subsequently transforming himself into the Crimson Bolt, Frank reasons that if he can take down Jacques along with the rest of the city's scum, his beloved wife will soon come running back. With his homemade suit and his handy pipe wrench, Frank goes to work cleaning up the streets and starts making headlines. But just as the Crimson Bolt becomes the talk of the town, sociopathic comic-store clerk Libby (Ellen Page) reinvents herself as "Boltie," and makes a play to become the controversial street hero's trusted sidekick. Perhaps by working together, the Crimson Bolt and Boltie can make an example of Jacques, and keep the streets safe for average citizens. But real life isn't like comic books, and sometimes when an average person tries to be a superhero, things can go very bad, very fast(n)</desc>

Elsewhere in the programme, John, a builder from Yorkshire, is haunted by not knowing his father, and after applying for his adoption files, he begins the search for his birth parents, Marlene and Kenneth.(n)</desc>

John recounts stories of royal connections - which fails to impress hotel managers Mark and Layla. In the morning, as they tuck in to a self-service breakfast, guest Tim decides that DIY doesn't work at Anstey Hall, but when he notes this on his feedback form, John and Johnny accuse him of game-playing.(n)</desc>

After a masterclass in Nordic walking, Lynnie serves up a veg smoothie, which unhealthy eaters Mark and Layla dubiously down in one. Over dinner, Tim challenges his host's organic 'niche'.

    <desc lang="en">Something nefarious is afloat in the depths of Bikini Bottom: King Neptune's crown has been stolen, and the prime suspect is Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob's boss at Mr. Krabs' Krabby Patties. Despite the overwhelming evidence against Mr. Krabs -- not to mention having been turned down for a long-awaited promotion at the restaurant -- SpongeBob (voice of Tom Kenny) refuses to believe that his boss is responsible and teams up with his best friend, Patrick (voice of Bill Fagerbakke), on a mission to Shell City, where he hopes he can exonerate Mr. Krabs and return the crown to its rightful owner. Of course, this is no easy task; once outside the safety of Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob is faced with the overwhelming dangers of the sea, not the least of which being a cyclops that many believe to be responsible for the deaths of countless other unfortunate sea-creatures who ventured outside county lines. Among those who lent their vocal chords to the film include Scarlett Johansson, Jeffrey Tambor, and Alec Baldwin(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The four heat winners enter the quarter-final, in which they face the daunting challenge of the Critic's Brief. Guest judge Jay Rayner gives them a simple instruction for a main dish - the twist being, the amateur cooks don't know who has set it until they come face to face with the food critic to hear his verdict. It's then back to the kitchen to prepare a dessert, again based on Rayner's brief - and this time, the one that doesn't make the grade fails to make it through to knockout week.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">John Torode and Gregg Wallace put more keen cooks to the test in first of two heats this week. As usual they begin by serving up their Calling Card, a dish that showcases their talents. The judges' two favourites then sit it out while the others reinvent what they've just made, creating a new plate of food based on the main ingredient from the first round. After this cook-off, one of the amateurs is sent home, before the remaining four prepare dinner for a trio of former MasterChef champions, after which Friday's first two quarter-finalists will be decided.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Celtic v FC Astana.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Celtic v FC Astana (Kick-off 7.45pm). Joanne Cantwell presents coverage of the play-off round first-leg match at Celtic Park, where the Bhoys will look to gain an advantage ahead of the second leg in Kazakhstan next week. The sides are already familiar to each other having met in the third qualifying round of this competition last term. In that tie, penalties by strikers Leigh Griffiths and Moussa Dembele gave the Bhoys a 2-1 win here following a 1-1 draw away from home. Brendan Rodgers' men then defeated Israeli champions Hapoel Be'er Sheva 5-4 on aggregate in this round to secure a place in the group stage, but finished bottom of the table behind Barcelona, Manchester City and Borussia Moenchengladbach. Commentary by George Hamilton and Jim Beglin.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A turning point in 20th century war history is the focus of this fact-based account of the 1942-1943 battle of Stalingrad, in which the Germans were finally defeated by Russian influence -- one of the bloodiest battles in World War II history. The film stars Jude Law as Vassili, a marksman from the Urals who is transported to Stalingrad in 1942, and a master German sniper, Major Koenig (Ed Harris). Koenig, an expert German sniper, is determined to eliminate his formidable opponent by any means necessary; meanwhile, Vassili has joined forces with Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), a young Russian political adversary, who is impressed by Vassili's skills and raises his profile in the Soviet Union. Both Vassili and Danilov become involved with Tanya (Rachel Weisz), whose Jewish parents have been captured by the Germans and have forced her to take up with the men on a sniper expedition. Koenig and Vassili begin to develop traps for each other, until fate inevitably must bring the two sharpshooters together. This large-scale production, financed mostly by Teuton companies, also features Bob Hoskins as Nikita Krushchev and Ron Perlman as an aging Russian sniper(n)</desc>

In order to earn a paycheck, Amy goes to work at a local sex shop owned by a spirited older couple. With flamboyant transvestite Rubio and charming local boy Alex on staff, life around the store is rarely dull. Still, Amy can't help but feeling like the future has something better in store for her, and she sets out to land an apprenticeship with notoriously withdrawn writer Rat Billings (John Cusack).

The film stars Jude Law as Vassili, a marksman from the Urals who is transported to Stalingrad in 1942, and a master German sniper, Major Koenig (Ed Harris). Koenig, an expert German sniper, is determined to eliminate his formidable opponent by any means necessary; meanwhile, Vassili has joined forces with Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), a young Russian political adversary, who is impressed by Vassili's skills and raises his profile in the Soviet Union. Both Vassili and Danilov become involved with Tanya (Rachel Weisz), whose Jewish parents have been captured by the Germans and have forced her to take up with the men on a sniper expedition. Koenig and Vassili begin to develop traps for each other, until fate inevitably must bring the two sharpshooters together. This large-scale production, financed mostly by Teuton companies, also features Bob Hoskins as Nikita Krushchev and Ron Perlman as an aging Russian sniper(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Roost</title>
    <desc lang="en">Creatures of the night find new prey on the scariest night of the year in this horror story. It's Halloween night, and four friends -- Allison (Vanessa Horneff), Elliott (Wil Horneff), Trevor (Karl Jacob), and Brian (Sean Reid) -- are on a road trip en route to a friend's wedding when their car breaks down after running into something. Looking for help, the four happen upon the farmhouse of an elderly couple, Elvin (Richard Little) and May (Barbara Wilhide), which is located next to a huge barn. Elvin and May have already become lost in the darkness of the barn, and soon two of the lost travelers are suffering the same fate as they search for friendly strangers. However, while they can barely see a hand in front of their face, they discover they're not alone in the barn, which has become home to a huge swarm of bloodthirsty bats. The Roost is framed by an introduction and postscript from a television horror show host, played by Tom Noonan(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Prestige</title>
    <desc lang="en">Obsession, jealousy, and deceit define the tense relationship shared between two turn-of-the-century magicians in Memento and Batman Begins director Christopher Nolan's dizzying tale of sleight of hand. Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are London-based magicians of the highest order, both blessed with spectacular powers of deception and both cursed with unrelenting envy for one another's skills. When Alfred performs an awe-inspiring trick for which there seems no logical explanation, the friendly competition shared between the pair turns to deadly rivalry as the enraged Rupert determines to uncover his rival's deepest secrets. In the world of illusion, however, nothing is ever quite as it seems, and the rules of the physical world simply don't apply. Now, as bitter competition quickly begins to consume the souls of both performers, the firestorm birthed by their anger threatens to consume all who surround them. Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, and David Bowie co-star in a feature that finds director/screenwriter Nolan reuniting with brother and Memento story author Jonathan Nolan to adapt author Christopher Priest's original novel(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Gore Verbinski and the crew set sail once again for this, the third chapter in the swashbuckling Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is hopelessly trapped in Davy Jones' locker after a harrowing encounter with the dreaded Kracken, and now Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) must align themselves with the nefarious Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) if they hold out any hope of saving their old friend from a fate worse than death. The East India Trading Company and its fearsome leader, Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), have taken control of the ghostly Flying Dutchman and its captain, Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), and now the baleful Admiral Norrington (Jack Davenport) has taken the helm in a relentless bid to destroy every pirate ship in his path and bring the Age of Piracy to a violent close. Meanwhile, Will, Elizabeth, and Captain Barbossa navigate treacherous waters and face bitter betrayal as they set sail to gather the only army that can stand up to Beckett -- The Nine Lords of the Brethren Court. But Captain Jack Sparrow is one of the lords, and as long as he's stuck in Davy Jones' locker, Beckett and his nefarious armada are sure to emerge victorious. There's still hope, however, if the heroic team that includes Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris), Pintel (Lee Arenberg), and Ragetti (Mackenzie Crook) can reach exotic Singapore and convince vulpine pirate Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat) to provide them with charts and a ship.

With the entire future of the pirate way at stake, everyone will be forced to choose sides while drifting precariously to the edge of the earth for one final, spectacular battle(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A carefree young woman wakes up to discover her greatest nightmare is a reality -- she's become trapped in the body of Rob Schneider -- in this shape-shifting comedy. Jessica (Rachel McAdams) is a beautiful teenager whose life would be the envy of any high school student -- she's head of the cheerleading squad, her boyfriend, Billy (Matthew Lawrence), is the quarterback of the football team, and she's pretty and popular enough to get nearly anyone to do what she wants. However, Jessica is soon to find out how the other half lives, in more ways than she counted upon; she shoplifts a pair of earrings from an shop specializing in African curios run by Mambuza (Angie Stone), unaware that they carry the curse of Princess Nawa. Thanks to the curse, the next morning Jessica awakes to find that her spirit has entered the body of Clive (Rob Schneider), a sweaty and hirsute small-time crook. As Jessica tries to figure out how she can return to her old body, she has to lead the cheerleading squad to victory and attend her senior prom while looking like a less-than-handsome 30-year-old man.

    <desc lang="en">The gang from Friday and Next Friday are back in this urban comedy, in which Craig (Ice Cube) and Day-Day (Mike Epps) have finally moved out of their respective parents' homes and gotten an apartment together. However, a bogus neighborhood Santa Claus (Rickey Smiley) decides to help Craig and Day-Day share the wealth by robbing their apartment, and when he rips off their stereo, he also makes off with their rent money, which was hidden in the speaker cabinets. Desperate to make rent and have some money for Christmas presents, Craig and Day-Day land jobs at a local strip mall, where their fathers, Mr. Jones (John Witherspoon) and Uncle Elroy (Don "D.C." Curry), have gone into business together running a barbecue joint. Craig and Day-Day are installed as security guards, and while Craig tries to make time with Donna (K.D. Aubert), a saleswoman at the Pimp N' Ho's Boutique, and keep things orderly at Holy Moly's Doughnut Shop, Day-Day attempts to transform himself into a master of crime-fighting, which causes a lot more problems than it solves. Friday After Next is the first feature film from director Marcus Raboy, who previously directed music videos for Sting, Li'l Kim, Staind, and Friday After Next star Ice Cube(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</title>
    <desc lang="en">Tobe Hooper's influential cult classic continues the subgenre of horror films based on the life and "career" of Wisconsin serial killer Ed Gein, which began with Alfred Hitchcock's own influential cult classic Psycho. When Sally Hardesty (Marilyn Burns) hears that the Texas cemetery where her grandfather is buried has been vandalized, she gathers her wheelchair-bound brother Franklin (Paul A. Partain) and several other friends together to see if grandpa's remains are still in one piece. While in the area, Sally and her friends decide to visit grandfather's old farmhouse. Unfortunately, a family of homicidal slaughterhouse workers who take their job home with them have taken over the house next door. Included amongst the brood is Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen), a chainsaw-wielding human horror show who wears a face mask made out of human skin. Sally's friends are rapidly exterminated one-by-one by the next-door neighbors, leaving only Sally left to fight off Leatherface and his clan(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">King Nine Will Not Return. As had been the case with the first season's inaugural episode "Where Is Everybody?", the second season of Twilight Zone opened with a "solo" drama, wherein the protagonist finds himself alone in a bizarre situation, with no memory of how he got there. In "King Nine Will Not Return," Robert Cummings stars as Army Air Force captain James Embry, who awakens to find himself stumbling through the desert, near the wreckage of a WWII bomber. Laboriously putting the pieces together, Embry desperately searches for his fellow crew members, who seemingly appear and disappear right before his eyes. Inspired by the recent disovery of the wreckage of the American bomber Lady Be Good in the Libyan Desert, "King Nine Will Not Return" was written by Rod Serling and first aired September 30, 1960(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Nervous Man in a $4 Room</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Nervous Man in a $4 Room. Though obviously an episode designed to absorb the costs of the more expensive Twilight Zone installments, this was one of the better efforts of the series' second season, with a tour de force performance by Joe Mantell as penny-ante gangster Jackie Rhoades. Ordered to bump off a rival gangster, the timorous Rhoades tries to summon up the courage for the foul deed, only to be thwarted at every turn by his own conscience -- who as it turns out has more "guts" than Jackie ever dreamed of. Though essentially a solo endeavor, the episode also features a good performance from future producer-director William D. Gordon as Jackie's nasty boss, while another future director, Brian G. Hutton, serves as Joe Mantell's back-to-camera stand-in when the actor "confronts" himself. Written by Rod Serling and scored by Jerry Goldsmith, "Nervous Man in a Four Dollar Room" was the first episode produced for Twilight Zone's second season, even though it was telecast as the third episode, on October 14, 1960(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Essentially a showcase for the talents of squeaky-voiced comedian Chris Tucker, who has been compared to a young Eddie Murphy by fans, and to fingernails on a chalkboard by detractors, this action-comedy centers on the unlikely friendship that develops between a fast-talking petty con-artist and a has-been newscaster who is trying to resurrect his career and marry a young noveau-riche debutante. Though strictly small potatoes, scam-man Franklin Hatchett (Tucker) attracts the attention of the TV anchorman James Russell (Charlie Sheen) while running his latest con at a carwash. Shortly after refusing an interview with Russell, Franklin ends up jailed. He manages to escape when a transfer bus is hijacked. Handcuffed to a French jewel thief involved in the attack, Franklin is dragged along. He escapes, but his troubles are not over, for he quickly learns that he is the accused perpetrator of the hijacking. When all is said and done, Franklin finds himself pursued by the cops, the thieves, loan sharks, and an irate pregnant girlfriend. In desperation he goes to Russell and makes a deal. Russell brings Franklin to his pre-wedding party to meet his fiance Grace Ciprani (Heather Locklear). Franklin creates big trouble when he tells her father Guy (Paul Sorvino) that he is Vic Damone, Jr., son of Vic Damone and Diahann Carroll. Guy accepts this and gives Franklin a real Italian welcome. But though he may feel safe for the moment, Franklin's troubles are just beginning and before the story ends, he and the hapless Russell are involved in gun fights, car chases and a final showdown at the Los Angeles Coliseum(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Kiss of the Coffee Woman. In this spoof of a popular mid-1990s TV advertising campaign, erstwhile talent agent Bud (David Faustino) arranges for Kelly (Christina Applegate) and Jefferson (Ted McGinley) to costar in a coffee commercial. The ad proves to be a huge hit with the public--so much so that the agency demands that Kelly and Jefferson exchange a kiss in their next appearance. Naturally, Kelly's dad Al (Ed O'Neill) and Jefferson's wife Marcy (Amanda Bearse) are dead set against this display of public affection, so Bud tries to mollify them by inviting them to the filming...where, unbeknownst to him, a conjugal bed is a prominent fixture of the set! Katey Sagal (Peggy) does not appear in this episode(n)</desc>

When Peter (voice of Seth MacFarlane) goes to investigate, he runs into his favorite old teacher, Mr. Vargas. Vargas has been ordered to take mood-altering medication by the school board, and is no longer the lovable wacko Peter remembers. Peter urges him to give up the drugs. He does, and promptly gets fired for his erratic behavior. Peter decides to run against Lois for the school board, so he can reinstate his old teacher. "This will be even easier than running unopposed," says Lois, but Peter lets his competitiveness get the better of him and unleashes a few dirty tricks. Meanwhile, Stewie (MacFarlane) finds himself unaccountably missing Lois, and sings "I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face" to explain. At a televised debate, Peter attacks Lois for her personal habits, and accuses, "She freed Willie Horton. She nailed Donna Rice." Peter does a campaign ad in which he claims, "Lois Griffin is a slut," and uses a photo she gave him of herself in a nightie as his evidence. Peter's dirty tricks win him the election. His unique take on sex education, and his use of killer robots (straight out of Robocop) to handle school security win him accolades, but the dirty magazines he gave Chris come back to haunt him.
