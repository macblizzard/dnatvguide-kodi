    <title lang="en">The Clearing</title>
    <desc lang="en">Director Pieter Jan Brugge's first film stars Robert Redford as Wayne Hayes, a rich, successful businessman, and Helen Mirren as his wife Eileen. When Wayne leaves for work one morning, he is kidnapped by Arnold Mack and led, bound, deeper and deeper into the woods. Eileen, eventually realising he's missing, calls in the FBI in the person of agent Ray Fuller. But what could have been a conventional procedural is lifted to another level as Brugge switches between the developing relationship between Wayne and Arnold, and the uncomfortable truths Ray extracts from Eileen, or learns from other sources, becoming as much a story about their marriage as the crime(n)</desc>

The chapter opens with Bella Swan on the cusp of her 18th birthday and blissfully happy with her undead beau Edward Cullen. But, while she's celebrating her birthday with Edward's family of 'vegetarian' vampires, a frightening incident convinces Edward that he's simply too dangerous to be around his sweetheart. He leaves the town of Forks in order to ensure her safety - leaving her behind, angry and depressed. Bella finds some relief from her emotional numbness through recklessly riding motorbikes and succumbing to the attentions of her friend Jacob Black. But he is also a supernatural being, and not one with a natural affinity to vampires(n)</desc>

Ultimately, of course, Charles finds ample reason to shiver in his boots, but not before his colleagues have dealt with such contigencies as an explosion, a severe case of hypothermia--and a marathon screening of the Sonja Henie skating epic Sun Valley Serenade(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Boobs in Arms. World War II was just heating up, but the U.S. hadn't yet entered the fighting when the Three Stooges made this comic short. It opens with the boys selling greeting cards on the street, none too successfully. One surly guy in particular is a victim of the Stooges' harassment. To get away from his wrath, the boys dash into an apartment building, where they find a weepy young woman who thinks her husband doesn't love her anymore. To help her out, the Stooges offer to try to make her husband jealous. The woman's spouse turns out to be the very same man they harassed a few minutes earlier. To get away from him -- again -- the guys get in what they think is a bread line, but it's really a recruitment line for the Army. In a flash the Stooges are in uniform -- only to discover that their sergeant is the very same angry husband. They manage to make it through basic training and are sleeping through bomb blasts when they're woken up and sent on a mission. The sergeant has been captured and they're supposed to bomb enemy headquarters with laughing gas. Naturally, the gas shell explodes on them and they're captured. At the enemy headquarters, they manage to knock everyone unconscious while laughing uncontrollably. The place is being shelled by the American troops, and the Stooges, still laughing, ride one of the shells as it soars out of the building(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Unstoppable</title>
    <desc lang="en">Denzel Washington and Chris Pine star in this intense action thriller, the final work to be directed by the late Tony Scott. Veteran railroad employee Frank Barnes has his quarrels with the new guy on the job, Will Colson, largely because the younger man is about to replace him. But they must join forces and race against time when an enormous runaway train carrying toxic chemicals heads their way. If its terminal destination in a city wasn't bad enough, the lethal behemoth is also on the same line as another train carrying 150 children home from a school trip. When the railroad company's chairman refuses to take action for financial reasons, Frank takes it upon himself to save the day, despite the seemingly suicidal nature of the mission and the devastating consequences it's likely to have for his loved ones. Will opposes Frank's ridiculously dangerous idea, but joins him anyway. Can the two men patch up their differences and save the day? In addition to the nail-biting action, the score beautifully highlights the suspense, and earned the film a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Sound Editing. Also starring Ethan Suplee, TJ Miller and Kevin Chapman(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Grand Visions is a short season of films driven by the vision and boldness of strong directors; passion projects made on a grand and uncompromising scale. The season kicks off with director Baz Luhrmann's western/ war adventure/ romance hybrid that's set in the Australian outback and stars Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman. It is 1939 and Lady Sarah Ashley has travelled halfway round the world to persuade her husband to sell his cattle station and return back home to Blighty. It's soon obvious that she hasn't anticipated the primitive realities of life in northern Australia, nor has her upbringing prepared her for an encounter with the likes of the rough and ready drover who is instructed to chaperone her from Darwin to the ranch. But the pair are fated to become much more closely acquainted than either could have imagined. The plot also encompasses the lot of the region's Aboriginal people, via the plight of local lad Nullah, and the first Japanese attacks on the northern territories. Edited for language(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Television director Peter O'Fallon made his feature film debut with this independent film that pays obvious homage to the style of Quentin Tarantino, with plenty of violence and funny, talkative hit men. Suave gangster Charlie Barrett (Christopher Walken) meets four young men who have taken over his regular booth at a popular bistro. Charmed by the swaggering kids, he agrees to take a ride with them, but they give him a sedative and he awakens in a deserted mansion, taped to a chair with one of his fingers missing. One of his abductors, Avery (Henry Thomas), says that he has a sister who has been kidnapped and they need two million dollars to get her back, as well as a finger to exchange for her severed digit. Charlie phones his lawyer Marty (Cliff De Young), who calls a henchman, Lono (Denis Leary), who investigates the kidnappings and gives Charlie enough information to start playing each of his inexperienced abductors against the others(n)</desc>

Baiae was located in a volcanic landscape, which provided a supply of hot water and steaming sulphur baths - but also led to the city's destruction.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Midnight Cowboy</title>
    <desc lang="en">Joe Buck (John Voight) is the naive Texas dishwasher who leaves his tiny town for a life as a male prostitute in New York City. He quits his job and gets on a northbound bus. The rural rube encounters the brassy Cass (Sylvia Miles) and believes he has his first paying customer, but the Jewish princess brings out the crying towel in mock humiliation. Joe ends up giving her money for cab fare as his experience foreshadows other demoralizing events. He meets local street hustler Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) who relieves Joe of some more cash and sends him to the demented religious fanatic O'Daniel (John McGiver). Joe is horrified to learn O'Daniel is not a pimp and flees his seedy apartment. Wandering the cold, lonely streets, Joe is amazed that a dead man on the sidewalk draws no attention or interest from the locals. He meets up with the conniving Ratso and threatens to kill him if he doesn't return the money. Ratso gives Joe a place to stay in a condemned apartment building where the two scrounge for survival as winter approaches. Joe is reduced to allowing himself to be used for homosexual sex and a young college student fails to pay for his services. Ratso and Joe attend a trendy, drug soaked Manhattan party where he meets the stoned Shirley (Brenda Vaccaro), who pays Joe double the asking price for his sexual services. Ratso is already a cripple who finds his health worsening with the arrival of winter. Joe returns Ratso's kindness by vowing to take the ailing petty thief to Miami. While Ratso dreams of sun, fun and bikini clad women, Joe encounters a simpering, middle-aged homosexual from Chicago in town for a convention. He asks the man for money but is far short of the amount needed for two-one way trips to Florida on the Greyhound bus. Joe knocks out the man's dentures and sticks telephone receiver down the man's throat. By now Ratso is convinced he will be preyed upon in the mean streets of New York if he doesn't get to warm weather soon. Midnight Cowboy won the Oscar for Best Picture, Best screenplay (Waldo Salt) and Best Director (John Schlesinger). Hoffman, Voight, and Miles were nominated for their performances. Fred Neil's song "Everybody's Talking" was a smash for Nillson. Warren Zevon wrote a song, and The Group and Elephant's Memory also contributed to the memorable soundtrack. The film was rated X at the time and it the only X rated feature to win the Academy Award(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Dave Chappelle's Block Party</title>
    <desc lang="en">In September 2004, comedian Dave Chappelle took a break from his immensely successful Comedy Central show to stage a free, unpublicized, all-star hip-hop concert in the Clinton Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn, NY. Inviting fans over the Internet, on the street, and even in his family's hometown of Yellow Springs, OH, Chappelle asked filmmaker Michel Gondry to document the event from its inception on through to the performances themselves. The result is Dave Chappelle's Block Party, a concert film that provides not only a sampling of the music on display that September, but also an intimate look at the comedian himself. Gondry's cameras tag along with Chappelle as he visits Ohio, recruits a university marching band to play at the show, and surveys the opinions of Clinton Hill on the show that's about to take place. Along the way, we're introduced to some the comedian's favorite acts, in rehearsals and on-stage: Dead Prez, Jill Scott, Mos Def, the Roots, Erykah Badu, Kanye West, and the surprise reuniting of the Fugees(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Joe Buck (John Voight) is the naive Texas dishwasher who leaves his tiny town for a life as a male prostitute in New York City. He quits his job and gets on a northbound bus. The rural rube encounters the brassy Cass (Sylvia Miles) and believes he has his first paying customer, but the Jewish princess brings out the crying towel in mock humiliation. Joe ends up giving her money for cab fare as his experience foreshadows other demoralizing events. He meets local street hustler Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) who relieves Joe of some more cash and sends him to the demented religious fanatic O'Daniel (John McGiver). Joe is horrified to learn O'Daniel is not a pimp and flees his seedy apartment. Wandering the cold, lonely streets, Joe is amazed that a dead man on the sidewalk draws no attention or interest from the locals. He meets up with the conniving Ratso and threatens to kill him if he doesn't return the money. Ratso gives Joe a place to stay in a condemned apartment building where the two scrounge for survival as winter approaches. Joe is reduced to allowing himself to be used for homosexual sex and a young college student fails to pay for his services. Ratso and Joe attend a trendy, drug soaked Manhattan party where he meets the stoned Shirley (Brenda Vaccaro), who pays Joe double the asking price for his sexual services. Ratso is already a cripple who finds his health worsening with the arrival of winter. Joe returns Ratso's kindness by vowing to take the ailing petty thief to Miami. While Ratso dreams of sun, fun and bikini clad women, Joe encounters a simpering, middle-aged homosexual from Chicago in town for a convention. He asks the man for money but is far short of the amount needed for two-one way trips to Florida on the Greyhound bus. Joe knocks out the man's dentures and sticks telephone receiver down the man's throat. By now Ratso is convinced he will be preyed upon in the mean streets of New York if he doesn't get to warm weather soon. Midnight Cowboy won the Oscar for Best Picture, Best screenplay (Waldo Salt) and Best Director (John Schlesinger). Hoffman, Voight, and Miles were nominated for their performances. Fred Neil's song "Everybody's Talking" was a smash for Nillson. Warren Zevon wrote a song, and The Group and Elephant's Memory also contributed to the memorable soundtrack. The film was rated X at the time and it the only X rated feature to win the Academy Award(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Dave Chappelle's Block Party</title>
    <desc lang="en">In September 2004, comedian Dave Chappelle took a break from his immensely successful Comedy Central show to stage a free, unpublicized, all-star hip-hop concert in the Clinton Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn, NY. Inviting fans over the Internet, on the street, and even in his family's hometown of Yellow Springs, OH, Chappelle asked filmmaker Michel Gondry to document the event from its inception on through to the performances themselves. The result is Dave Chappelle's Block Party, a concert film that provides not only a sampling of the music on display that September, but also an intimate look at the comedian himself. Gondry's cameras tag along with Chappelle as he visits Ohio, recruits a university marching band to play at the show, and surveys the opinions of Clinton Hill on the show that's about to take place. Along the way, we're introduced to some the comedian's favorite acts, in rehearsals and on-stage: Dead Prez, Jill Scott, Mos Def, the Roots, Erykah Badu, Kanye West, and the surprise reuniting of the Fugees(n)</desc>

In this outing, the guys climb up on the town's water tower to paint a huge marijuana leaf. Dissatisfied with the results, Kelso (Ashton Kutcher) scrambles up the tower again, only to plunge painfully to earth. Rather than take Kelso to a hospital, Eric (Topher Grace) reasons that his mom, Kitty (Debra Jo Rupp), a nurse, is in closer proximity. Rushing headlong into his house, Eric finds his mom and dad in the throes of passion. Shocked by the spectacle, Eric lapses into some very strange behavior. Listen for a familiar voice during one of Eric's tortured fantasies(n)</desc>

He also showcases stand-alone feats, such as Jean Claude Van Damme's daring splits manoeuvre between two moving trucks, and Felix Baumgartner's free fall to Earth from the stratosphere. Includes commentary from fans, comedians, stunt coordinators and the daredevils themselves.(n)</desc>

The programme also features footage of killer whales, which rely on their intelligence, Nile crocodiles that can wait years between meals, spiders able to spin 25 foot webs and amur falcons, which travel 16,000 miles every year to hunt insects.

A polar bear climbs to reach a birds' nest, while another makes holes in the ice to catch seals. Plus, a look at how Arctic foxes have adapted to catch auks in mid-flight and the hunting strategies of Arctic wolves. Narrated by David Attenborough.(n)</desc>

However, it proves a tricky environment for predators, as vision is often blocked, escape routes are numerous, and the terrain makes travelling at speed almost impossible. The programme features footage of tigers using their surroundings to ambush deer and pine martens making tunnels in the snow, as well as examining the strategies adopted by sparrowhawks, jumping spiders, tarsiers, eagles and chimpanzees.(n)</desc>

He begins in the Kalahari desert, Africa's south-west corner, where clever meerkats are outsmarted by a wily bird's use of mimicry, a solitary rhino is seen to exhibit previously unknown sociable behaviours, terrifying insects prey on baby birds and the rarest fish in the world is filmed for the first time. In the neighbouring Namib desert, which receives almost no rain, the competition for scant resources can be fierce, as proven by a ferocious fight for supremacy between two giraffes.(n)</desc>

From dense forests to snow-capped peaks, steamy swamps to endless savannah, it's also a land of unpredictable extremes, where creatures must adapt to survive. In Tanzania, a tiny lizard risks its life to eat flies from the face of a sleepy lion. The nesting habits of the 4ft shoebill are also captured on camera - the giant bird has two chicks, but due to sibling rivalry only one will survive. On the plains of Amboseli, a baby elephant is near to death in the drought, so its mother leaves the herd to stay with her offspring until the bitter end.(n)</desc>

There, thousands of butterflies dance for the right to mate, while on a tiny island off Mozambique, green turtles emerge from eggs and begin a hazardous journey to the water - with pied crows and hungry crabs eager to get them. Cameras also capture one of the largest gatherings of great white sharks on the planet as 30 of the predators circle around a dead whale.(n)</desc>

The naked mole rat avoids the heat by living a subterranean existence, while the silver ant is able to take on the midday sun - but needs a `spacesuit' to do it.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">David Attenborough explores the vast and diverse continent, aiming to show its landscapes and wildlife as they have never been seen before. He begins in the Kalahari desert, Africa's south-west corner, where clever meerkats are outsmarted by a wily bird's use of mimicry, a solitary rhino is seen to exhibit previously unknown sociable behaviours, terrifying insects prey on baby birds and the rarest fish in the world is filmed for the first time. In the neighbouring Namib desert, which receives almost no rain, the competition for scant resources can be fierce, as proven by a ferocious fight for supremacy between two giraffes.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">David Attenborough continues his exploration of the continent in east Africa, which is a haven for life and supports a higher density of large mammals than anywhere else on Earth. From dense forests to snow-capped peaks, steamy swamps to endless savannah, it's also a land of unpredictable extremes, where creatures must adapt to survive. In Tanzania, a tiny lizard risks its life to eat flies from the face of a sleepy lion. The nesting habits of the 4ft shoebill are also captured on camera - the giant bird has two chicks, but due to sibling rivalry only one will survive. On the plains of Amboseli, a baby elephant is near to death in the drought, so its mother leaves the herd to stay with her offspring until the bitter end.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Directed by the prolific Rob Zombie, The Devil's Rejects is a sequel of sorts to 2003's House of 1000 Corpses, and picks up several weeks after House left off. This time, the clash revolves around the tribe of violent lunatics and decidedly valueless family members of the original film, who have come to be known as the "Devil's Rejects." After learning of the extended family's horrific attacks, a SWAT team is sent to take them into custody; all but their crazed Mama escape. In addition to creating a full-fledged media circus, this sends the sociopath housemates on the run, and they initiate a deadly road trip. Meanwhile, Mama has to deal with a violent, vengeful sheriff (William Forsythe). The Devil's Rejects features Bill Moseley, Sid Haig, Sheri Moon, Michael Berryman, and Ken Foree, among other cult horror regulars(n)</desc>

Upset at discovering that his ex-girlfriend is planning to move out of state with the couple's young son, Durell knows that the only way to keep his fractured family in close proximity to one another is to raise the 17,000 dollars needed to pay off her growing debt. In order to get the money before his ex decides to make the big move, the desperate Durell enlists the aid of his scheming best buddy to rob their neighborhood church.

    <title lang="en">Elysium</title>
    <desc lang="en">In a future in which the privileged reside on an Earth-orbiting space station named Elysium and the less fortunate live on the surface of the blighted, overpopulated planet below, one man dares to defy the strict anti-immigration laws that separate the two disparate worlds in order to save all of mankind in this visceral sci-fi action thriller from District 9 director Neill Blomkamp. The year is 2154, and the division between social classes has grown wider than ever before. As the rich enjoy a life of luxury and access to cutting-edge medical technology on Elysium, the rest of the human race contend with poverty, crime, and disease on the surface of planet Earth. Meanwhile, hard-line immigration laws ensure that only those who have been explicitly approved will ever set foot on the elusive paradise in the stars. 36-year-old Max (Matt Damon) lives in an L.A. shantytown and earns his living by working on an Armadyne assembly line. He's had a rough past, but he's struggling to stay on the right side of the law when he realizes that his only hope for survival after being exposed to deadly radiation is to reach Elysium. Should Max succeed, he will strike a major blow for equality in the eyes of his fellow surface dwellers; should he fail, it will mean certain death. In his quest to become the hero who can restore the balance between the rich and the poor, however, Max must first do battle with Elysium's hawkish Secretary of Defense Delacourt (Jodie Foster), who has devoted her entire career to maintaining that division, and whose key enforcer Kruger (Sharlto Copley) is notorious for his brutal tactics in driving out illegals. With the fates of millions hanging in the balance, Max sets his sights on Elysium and never looks back. Alice Braga, Diego Luna, William Fichtner, and Faran Tahir co-star(n)</desc>

It turns out the prisoner in question is none other than Sideshow Bob (voice of Kelsey Grammer), who ended up behind bars after Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright) exposed his plan to frame Krusty the Clown (voice of Dan Castellaneta) for robbery. Selma and Sideshow Bob decide to tie the knot, but Bart is convinced Bob has something up his sleeve, and after viewing a video of the couple's vacation trip, Bart must run to the rescue to prevent Selma from being murdered.

Rather than participate in a litter-cleanup program sponsored by the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) decides to fake his own death so he can spend his weekend loafing in a hammock. Marge (voice of Julie Kavner), however, doesn't think much of Homer's little scam, and orders him to inform the authorities that they've issued a death certificate to a man who's still alive. However, while ironing out the paperwork, Homer learns his mother is still alive and wanted by the law, even though Grampa (also voiced by Castellaneta) told him years ago she'd passed on. Homer finds his Mother (voice of Glenn Close) visiting his grave, and discovers she's been a fugitive for close to 20 years. After being immediately radicalized by the sight of Joe Namath's sideburns, Mother went back to college and fell in with a group of revolutionary activists who destroyed a germ warfare lab sponsored by C. Montgomery Burns (voice of Harry Shearer) with powerful antibiotic gas. Mother soon discovers Burns hasn't forgotten what she did, and she quickly finds herself being hounded by the Springfield police once again.

    <desc lang="en">The double Michelin-starred chef creates new versions of some of Britain's favourite recipes, elevating everyday, ordinary food with his impressive flair. In the first episode, Tom focuses on crowd-pleasing dishes, perfect for sharing at a party, including crispy stuffed potato skins with Roquefort and pancetta, pulled beef brisket with garlic coleslaw, and barbecued mackerel. He finishes off with an indulgent chocolate tart that is not only delicious, but also deceptively easy to rustle up.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Michelin-starred chef creates dishes inspired by some of his favourite takeaway foods, starting with a puff pastry pizza topped with crispy beef. He cooks an upmarket version of a doner kebab in which he swaps the usual lamb for duck and shows how to make a grown-up doughnut stuffed with an innovative chocolate filling that tastes of Turkish delight. Tom also comes up with a twist on the traditional Cornish pasty by replacing meat with smoked haddock and prepares burgers made with real ham to feed spectators at a greyhound track.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Michelin-starred chef creates dishes for the weekend, when people have a bit more time to enjoy being in the kitchen and cook themselves something extra special. He roasts a leg of lamb wrapped in branches of bay leaves to pack in extra flavour, salt-bakes garlic and lemon before stirring them through wilted greens and fuses Malaysian and British cuisines by creating his own satay roast chicken. As not everyone gets time off at the weekend, Tom decides to cook a weekend brunch for a group of firefighters and serves up the ultimate English breakfast omelette cooked in one pan.(n)</desc>

It's about to get a whole lot hotter in the kitchen, though, as it reaches the quarter-final stage, and just five amateur bakers remain. They've all impressed to various extents during Bread Week - at least sufficiently to make it through - but now their skills are thoroughly tested as they take on enriched doughs.

    <desc lang="en">Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc present as the remaining four bakers take a deep breath and head into the semi-final of the nation's favourite baking contest. However, there's no time to marvel at how far they've come - it's Patisserie Week, and they will need to demonstrate that they have skills worthy enough to see them through to this year's final. The bakers are challenged to make a signature baklava - two types of any flavour they like, before the technical challenge demands they knock up a German Schichttorte, a cake cooked in stages under the grill to create 20 layers of different coloured sponge. Finally, the showstopper sees the semi-finalists baking non-stop to create two entremets in which they should demonstrate as many personal skills and techniques as they can.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Three contestants remain and only one more weekend of baking stands between them and the 2014 title. Judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry have saved their most fiendish tests till last, as the finalists face a Signature Challenge in which they have just three hours to prove they have mastered a pastry technique that usually takes a whole day. They then have to tackle a Technical Challenge without the aid of a recipe, before rustling up a Showstopper that turns sponge, caramel, choux pastry and petits fours into a winning combination. At least Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc are on hand to lighten the atmosphere if it all gets too tense.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Just how low will a guy sink in order to impress the woman of his dreams? How does stealing her dog sound? In Lost and Found, David Spade plays Dylan, who is about to open an new restaurant and has finally found the perfect apartment. The apartment just gets better when he meets his new neighbor, Lila (Sophie Marceau), a very beautiful women who has recently come to the United States from France. However, Lila has just gotten out of a bad relationship with René (Patrick Bruel), who doesn't want to leave her alone, so she has little interest in romance, preferring to devote herself to her cello and her dog Jack. One day, Jack runs away and Dylan finds him; when he returns the pooch to Lila, it's the first time she's been willing to speak in full sentences to him, though not for very long. Faster than you can say "That idea is so crazy it just might work!", Dylan decides to kidnap Jack; when Lila thinks the dog is lost, Dylan will generously volunteer to help look for him, which will give Dylan a chance to impress Lila when he's able to find Jack so quickly. Sure enough, Dylan swipes the dog, but from that point on the plan hardly goes the way he had hoped. Star David Spade also co-wrote the screenplay with J.B. Cook and Marc Meeks; the supporting cast includes Martin Sheen, Mitchell Whitfield, Artie Lang and Jon Lovitz(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Jim Carrey and Virginia Madsen star in this dark psychological thriller from director Joel Schumacher (The Phantom of the Opera, Batman &amp; Robin). Walter Sparrow is leading a contented life until his wife Agatha innocently gives him a battered old paperback as a gift. As he reads, Sparrow is astonished by the parallels between his life and that of the novel's protagonist, Fingerling. But as the plot progresses it grows darker, featuring themes of transgressive sex, suicide and murder. It also hinges around Fingerling's obsession with the number 23 - a prime number that seems to pop up everywhere in the universe once you start to notice it. It's not long before 23 takes a similar hold on Sparrow. And, when he begins unjustly to view Agatha in the same distrustful light that Fingerling views his own spouse Fabrizia, it seems as if Sparrow has locked on to the same tragic trajectory as the story's lead character. Or can he find a way to wrench himself from the novel's grip?(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Rushmore</title>
    <desc lang="en">After the highly acclaimed independent film Bottle Rocket, director Wes Anderson followed up with a quirky Touchstone Studios film entitled Rushmore. Written by Anderson and friend Owen Wilson (an actor in Armageddon and Anaconda), they created the story of Max Fischer, a highly eccentric 15-year-old boy who attends the tenth grade at Rushmore Academy. Played by Jason Schwartzman (Talia Shire's son and Francis Ford Coppola's nephew), Max is a poor student with big dreams and a love of extracurricular activities. Max is editor of the school newspaper and yearbook, president of the chess, astronomy, French, and German clubs, captain of the fencing team, and director of the school play. Max is also a compulsive liar, telling everyone that his barber father (Seymour Cassel) is really a brain surgeon. Suddenly Max falls in love with Miss Cross (Olivia Williams), a first-grade teacher at the school. He also makes a new friend in business tycoon Mr. Blume (Bill Murray), an eccentric millionaire who also loves Miss Cross. The love triangle heats up as Max refuses to believe that his age has anything to do with Miss Cross refusing his romantic advances. Also Max's scheme to erect an aquarium on the school baseball diamond gets him booted out of Rushmore Academy. As his life crumbles around him, he is forced to grow up and accept the consequences of his actions and his lies. He throws himself more into his extracurricular activities, hoping to redeem himself by staging the most ambitious school play ever attempted(n)</desc>

In Lost and Found, David Spade plays Dylan, who is about to open an new restaurant and has finally found the perfect apartment. The apartment just gets better when he meets his new neighbor, Lila (Sophie Marceau), a very beautiful women who has recently come to the United States from France. However, Lila has just gotten out of a bad relationship with René (Patrick Bruel), who doesn't want to leave her alone, so she has little interest in romance, preferring to devote herself to her cello and her dog Jack. One day, Jack runs away and Dylan finds him; when he returns the pooch to Lila, it's the first time she's been willing to speak in full sentences to him, though not for very long. Faster than you can say "That idea is so crazy it just might work!", Dylan decides to kidnap Jack; when Lila thinks the dog is lost, Dylan will generously volunteer to help look for him, which will give Dylan a chance to impress Lila when he's able to find Jack so quickly. Sure enough, Dylan swipes the dog, but from that point on the plan hardly goes the way he had hoped. Star David Spade also co-wrote the screenplay with J.B.

    <desc lang="en">Jim Carrey and Virginia Madsen star in this dark psychological thriller from director Joel Schumacher (The Phantom of the Opera, Batman &amp; Robin). Walter Sparrow is leading a contented life until his wife Agatha innocently gives him a battered old paperback as a gift. As he reads, Sparrow is astonished by the parallels between his life and that of the novel's protagonist, Fingerling. But as the plot progresses it grows darker, featuring themes of transgressive sex, suicide and murder. It also hinges around Fingerling's obsession with the number 23 - a prime number that seems to pop up everywhere in the universe once you start to notice it. It's not long before 23 takes a similar hold on Sparrow. And, when he begins unjustly to view Agatha in the same distrustful light that Fingerling views his own spouse Fabrizia, it seems as if Sparrow has locked on to the same tragic trajectory as the story's lead character. Or can he find a way to wrench himself from the novel's grip?(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Rushmore</title>
    <desc lang="en">After the highly acclaimed independent film Bottle Rocket, director Wes Anderson followed up with a quirky Touchstone Studios film entitled Rushmore. Written by Anderson and friend Owen Wilson (an actor in Armageddon and Anaconda), they created the story of Max Fischer, a highly eccentric 15-year-old boy who attends the tenth grade at Rushmore Academy. Played by Jason Schwartzman (Talia Shire's son and Francis Ford Coppola's nephew), Max is a poor student with big dreams and a love of extracurricular activities. Max is editor of the school newspaper and yearbook, president of the chess, astronomy, French, and German clubs, captain of the fencing team, and director of the school play. Max is also a compulsive liar, telling everyone that his barber father (Seymour Cassel) is really a brain surgeon. Suddenly Max falls in love with Miss Cross (Olivia Williams), a first-grade teacher at the school. He also makes a new friend in business tycoon Mr. Blume (Bill Murray), an eccentric millionaire who also loves Miss Cross. The love triangle heats up as Max refuses to believe that his age has anything to do with Miss Cross refusing his romantic advances. Also Max's scheme to erect an aquarium on the school baseball diamond gets him booted out of Rushmore Academy. As his life crumbles around him, he is forced to grow up and accept the consequences of his actions and his lies. He throws himself more into his extracurricular activities, hoping to redeem himself by staging the most ambitious school play ever attempted(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Following up The Country Bears and Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, Disney continued their theme-park-attraction-based film kick with this horror comedy from director Rob Minkoff (Stuart Little). The Haunted Mansion stars Eddie Murphy as Jim Evers, an overworked patriarch who, along with his neglected family, finds himself in mansion inhabited by 999 ghosts. Once the fright wears off, the inhabitants of the other side teach Evers a lesson about the importance of family. Along with Don Knotts, who's had his share of spooky experiences in Disney flicks, the film also stars Terence Stamp, Aree Davis, and Jennifer Tilly(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Roy (Nicolas Cage) is an agoraphobic obsessive-compulsive con man who sells water filters at ten times their value, by offering fabulous prizes to the buyers. When difficulties start interfering with their tricks, psychoanalysis appears as an alternative to pills. During the sessions, he begins to suspect he has a daughter (Alison Lohman), whose existence he never dared confirm. When he finally meets her, she is completely fascinated by her father's lifestyle, so much so, that she wants to go into partnership with him. At the casting for this film, Lohman dressed and behaved like a 14-year-old, until, under pressure from Ridley Scott, she admitted to being 22(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Casper</title>
    <desc lang="en">Based on the popular cartoon character, this family-oriented "ghost story" is about a not-so-scary spirit who bonds with a little girl (Christina Ricci). The eternally irritable Ms. Carrigan (Cathy Moriarty) discovers that the only thing she's been left in her recently departed father's will is a rickety old house in New England. Naturally, the woman is furious about this, until her "close personal friend" and assistant, Dibbs (Eric Idle of Monty Python fame), discovers a secret message that a treasure may be concealed somewhere in the house. The two take off for Maine, only to learn that the house is haunted by Casper "the friendly ghost" and his three ghostly uncles Stinky, Stretch, and Fatso. After futilely recruiting an exorcist (Don Novello, more or less reviving his Father Guido Sarducci character from Saturday Night Live) and a "professional ghost exterminator" (Dan Aykroyd), she brings in a "ghost psychiatrist" (Bill Pullman) and his daughter Kat (Ricci). Innocently attracted to the young girl, Casper befriends Kat as they try to save the ghosts' home from the evil Carrigan. Eye-popping special effects highlight this magical story that touches (albeit lightly) on the theme of what lies at the heart of human desires. Clint Eastwood, Rodney Dangerfield, Mel Gibson and The Crypt Keeper (of Tales from the Crypt) all make cameos as apparitions in the mirror Bill Pullman looks into in the house(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Last Mimzy</title>
    <desc lang="en">An intergalactic package discovered on the beach holds a myriad of fantastic discoveries for siblings Noah and Emma Wilder in The Last Mimzy, studio head-turned-director Bob Shaye's wondrous sci-fi fantasy parable. The children stumble onto their discovery amid a trip to the family beach house, and find inside of the crate strange crystals that Emma levitates with her mind, as well as the Mimzy -- a stuffed bunny with a built-in supercomputer that advances its possessor's brain by great leaps and bounds by whispering into the person's ear. Meanwhile, via interaction with the box and its contents, Noah gains the ability to converse with spiders and instructs them to build miniature bridges. He also etches complex Tibetan mandalas, and somehow manages to black out half of Seattle. The children naturally keep these happenings (and the box) from their mom and dad (Joely Richardson and Timothy Hutton), but in time the kids set their sights higher and embark on correcting huge problems that cannot be missed. Rainn Wilson (The Office) co-stars as the children's hippie science teacher; New Age expert Bruce Joel Rubin (Ghost, Jacob's Ladder) and Toby Emmerich co-authored the script, adapting the 1943 short story Mimsy Were the Borogoves, by Lewis Padgett(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Great Raid</title>
    <desc lang="en">John Dahl directed this war drama based on the true story of one of the most daring military actions of World War II. In the waning days of World War II, General Douglas MacArthur chose to make good on a pledge that he made in 1942 -- that he would return to the Philippines after he and his troops were forced to retreat. However, MacArthur's determination was more than a matter of pride. Over 500 American soldiers were being held in Cabanatuan, a notoriously brutal prisoner of war camp in the Philippines operated by the Japanese army, and MacArthur wanted to see to it that they made it home. MacArthur chose Lt. Col. Henry Mucci (Benjamin Bratt) to lead the Sixth Ranger Battalion on a mission 30 miles behind enemy lines to infiltrate Cabanatuan and liberate the American prisoners. With the help of Capt. Prince (James Franco), Mucci leads his men on a life-or-death raid against forces known for their savagery. The Great Raid was based on William B. Breuer's book The Great Raid on Cabanatuan: Rescuing the Doomed Ghosts of Bataan and Corregidor, and also stars Joseph Fiennes, Connie Nielsen, and Marton Csokas(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Cider House Rules</title>
    <desc lang="en">John Irving scripted this screen adaptation of his 1985 novel. Set during World War II, The Cider House Rules concerns Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire), an orphan who spent most of his childhood at the St. Cloud Orphanage in rural Maine, where he grew up under the strong but affectionate care of Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine). Larch has passed along his medical education to Homer, and the young man helps the doctor care for abandoned children and the newborn babies of unwed mothers; however, Homer refuses to assist Larch with the illegal abortions that he performs on the side; Homer has moral objections to abortion, while Larch believes in the rights of the individual and sees it as his duty to keep women in need away from dangerous incompetents. Wally Worthington (Paul Rudd), an air-force pilot, brings his girlfriend Candy (Charlize Theron) to St. Cloud for an abortion, and Homer decides to go with them when they leave, hoping to see the world; however, the three end up going no further than the state line, where Wally's mother (Kate Nelligan) runs an apple orchard and cider mill, and Candy's family traps lobsters. When Wally ships off to battle, Homer grows closer to Candy, and the two fall in love. But their idyllic life at the cider mill is interrupted when Rose Rose (Erykah Badu), a field worker at the orchard, becomes pregnant and her father, cider-house foreman Mr. Rose (Delroy Lindo), turns out to be the father of her unborn child. This news coupled with the death of Dr. Larch, forces Homer to take a long look at both his moral principles and his future. Rapper Heavy D appears in the supporting cast as Peaches(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Visionary filmmaker Christopher Nolan (Memento, The Dark Knight) writes and directs this psychological sci-fi action film about a thief who possesses the power to enter into the dreams of others. Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) doesn't steal things, he steals ideas. By projecting himself deep into the subconscious of his targets, he can glean information that even the best computer hackers can't get to. In the world of corporate espionage, Cobb is the ultimate weapon. But even weapons have their weakness, and when Cobb loses everything, he's forced to embark on one final mission in a desperate quest for redemption. This time, Cobb won't be harvesting an idea, but sowing one. Should he and his team of specialists succeed, they will have discovered a new frontier in the art of psychic espionage. They've planned everything to perfection, and they have all the tools to get the job done. Their mission is complicated, however, by the sudden appearance of a malevolent foe that seems to know exactly what they're up to, and precisely how to stop them(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The actor travels to the wild and remote coastline of the Outer Hebrides and discovers how an unpredictable climate has given these islands an identity and way of life of their own. At the ancient village of Gearrannan, Robson tries his hand at weaving Harris Tweed in a traditional crofter's blackhouse, with mixed results, and on the Isle of Lewis he goes snorkelling for sugar kelp, used to flavour the local gin. He also camps on the beach at Luskentyre, and on the Isle of Barra helps out at the airport, where the beach doubles as its only runway.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Fifty-two-year-old retired firefighter John is airlifted to A&amp;E after being accidentally hit in the face with a golf club, which hit him so hard that it snapped. With a suspected critical head injury, he is sent for a CT scan, and doctors are concerned that his right eye is not reacting as it should and he is weak down the right-hand side of his body. Meanwhile, 77-year-old Joan arrives in St George's after falling down the stairs at home and hurting her leg. As she waits to be treated, she talks about growing up in Camberwell.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Patrick Aryee concludes his two-part exploration of the feline family tree, revealing how the Canadian lynx learned to thrive in the snow and spread out, evolving and inhabiting new parts of the Americas. In Belize, he mounts an experiment that showcases the margay's supersharp senses and gravity-defying acrobatics, and heads to the training track with a cheetah to find out what speed it is capable of. Finally, Patrick tells the story of the cat's domestication in Essaouira, Morocco, believed to be one of the first places where one particular species first gave up life in the wild in return for food, warmth, security and a home.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The broadcaster explores the Galapagos, a collection of volcanic islands in the Pacific known for its extraordinary wildlife. More than 150 years after Charles Darwin formulated his ground-breaking theory of evolution on the remote archipelago, Attenborough explains how life on the islands has continued to evolve in biological isolation, examining how the ever-changing volcanic landscape has given birth to species and sub-species that exist nowhere else in the world. He begins by revealing how Galapagos rose from the ocean four million years ago.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The veteran naturalist examines the world of flight, travelling across the globe to chart the evolutionary story of those creatures who seemingly defy the rules of gravity by taking to the air. Initially focusing on insects, Attenborough meets a descendant of the dragonfly, before examining the Atlas beetle, which tends to restrict flight to times when it needs a mate or a fresh supply of food. More aesthetically pleasing is a group of beautiful tropical butterflies, followed by an in-depth study into the blow fly - the jet fighter of insects.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Cookout</title>
    <desc lang="en">When Todd Anderson (Storm P) signs a 30-million-dollar contract with the New Jersey Nets after being named the number one NBA draft pick of the year, his mother (Jenifer Lewis) vows to prevent her son from forgetting his roots. Not used to balancing his new life with his old, Todd mistakenly invites family and friends from his old neighborhood to his multi-million-dollar house for a cookout on the same day of an important endorsement interview. Though his extravagant family cookouts were welcome at his old digs, Todd's stuffy new neighbors -- particularly the conservative Republican Judge Halsted Crowley (Danny Glover) -- are less than thrilled with the arrival of Todd's massive family. Complicating the situation further is the eccentric neighborhood security guard (Queen Latifah), who takes on the heady assignment of ensuring that none of the private community's rules are broken, as well as two thugs who, determined to get an autographed pair of sneakers, hold up the cookout at gunpoint. Directed by Lance Rivera, The Cookout also features performances from Ja Rule, Eve, Farrah Fawcett, and Jonathan Silverman(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Enemy at the Gates</title>
    <desc lang="en">A turning point in 20th century war history is the focus of this fact-based account of the 1942-1943 battle of Stalingrad, in which the Germans were finally defeated by Russian influence -- one of the bloodiest battles in World War II history. The film stars Jude Law as Vassili, a marksman from the Urals who is transported to Stalingrad in 1942, and a master German sniper, Major Koenig (Ed Harris). Koenig, an expert German sniper, is determined to eliminate his formidable opponent by any means necessary; meanwhile, Vassili has joined forces with Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), a young Russian political adversary, who is impressed by Vassili's skills and raises his profile in the Soviet Union. Both Vassili and Danilov become involved with Tanya (Rachel Weisz), whose Jewish parents have been captured by the Germans and have forced her to take up with the men on a sniper expedition. Koenig and Vassili begin to develop traps for each other, until fate inevitably must bring the two sharpshooters together. This large-scale production, financed mostly by Teuton companies, also features Bob Hoskins as Nikita Krushchev and Ron Perlman as an aging Russian sniper(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Requiem for a Dream</title>
    <desc lang="en">Darren Aronofsky follows up on his critically acclaimed Pi with this grim fable about drugs and addiction. Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) is a bored and lonely widow who kills time watching infomercials and eating chocolate in her small Coney Island apartment. One day she receives a phone call telling her that she might have the opportunity to appear on her favorite TV game show. Beside herself with anticipation, she frets over her chocolate-induced weight and vows to return to her former svelte figure. With the help of a less than reputable doctor, Sara is soon on a steady regimen of uppers. Meanwhile, her deadbeat son Harry (Jared Leto) aims for his shot at quick success along with his buddy Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) by selling heroin on the street. Harry and his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) squirrel away dough so that they can open a boutique that will showcase her fashion designs. When drug deals go bad and the money starts to dry up, the three siphon off their wares for their own habits. At the same time, Sara descends further and further into a popper-induced psychosis. By the film's grisly climax, limbs are lopped off, flesh is pedaled, and electroshock therapy is administered. This film was screened at the 2000 Cannes and Toronto film festivals(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Double Whammy</title>
    <desc lang="en">A cop tries to sort out his personal life while a wave of odd behavior sweeps through his apartment building in this quirky comedy. Ray Pluto (Dennis Leary) is a New York City police detective who has been in an emotional slump since his wife and daughter died in an accident several years earlier. Ray's mood isn't lightened at all when he and his partner Jerry Cubbins (Steve Buscemi) stop into a fast food restaurant just as an armed robbery is taking place. Ray throws out his back while reaching for his gun and drops the weapon; a child who picks up the gun and kills the intruders is declared a hero in the press, while Ray is dubbed "the loser cop." Put on medical leave, Ray sinks deeper into a funk until he starts seeing a chiropractor for his bad back; the beautiful Dr. Ann Beamer (Elizabeth Hurley) begins kneading the kinks out of Ray's spine and starts him thinking about a new romance. Meanwhile, Juan Benitez (Luis Guzman) is the superintendent of Ray's apartment building, and he's not been getting along well with his teenage daughter Maribel (Melonie Diaz), who has a wild streak and refuses to obey her father's strict rules. Maribel is no happier with her father, and decides to do something about their relationship -- she hires two men to assassinate her dad. And elsewhere in the same building, a pair of would-be screenwriters (Donald Faison and Keith Knobbs) wants to ensure the realism of their cops-and-robbers story by going on a little crime spree of their own. Double Whammy had its world premiere at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Jay Hernandez, Jennifer Carpenter, and Johnathon Schaech star in this remake of Jaume Balagueró and Paco Plaza's successful, Spanish-language horror film [REC], which follows a television reporter and her cameraman as they fall under a mysterious quarantine issued on an inner-city apartment building. Television reporter Angela Vidal (Carpenter) and her trusty cameraman (Steve Harris) were documenting a night in the life of a Los Angeles fire station crew when the firefighters were summoned to a nearby apartment building to answer a routine 911 call. Upon arriving at the scene, Angela and company discover that police have already arrived to investigate the blood-curdling screams ringing out from one of the apartments. One of the women living in the building has been infected with something terrible, but what? When a few of the other residents are viciously attacked, they try to escape and discover that the CDC has quarantined the building. The officials in charge won't relay any information to those trapped inside the building, and it's impossible to seek information from the outside since telephone, Internet, television, and cell-phone access have all been cut off. By the time the quarantine is lifted, the intrepid cameraman's chilling footage provides the only evidence of the horrors that unfolded on that terrible night(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Jay Hernandez, Jennifer Carpenter, and Johnathon Schaech star in this remake of Jaume Balagueró and Paco Plaza's successful, Spanish-language horror film [REC], which follows a television reporter and her cameraman as they fall under a mysterious quarantine issued on an inner-city apartment building. Television reporter Angela Vidal (Carpenter) and her trusty cameraman (Steve Harris) were documenting a night in the life of a Los Angeles fire station crew when the firefighters were summoned to a nearby apartment building to answer a routine 911 call. Upon arriving at the scene, Angela and company discover that police have already arrived to investigate the blood-curdling screams ringing out from one of the apartments. One of the women living in the building has been infected with something terrible, but what? When a few of the other residents are viciously attacked, they try to escape and discover that the CDC has quarantined the building. The officials in charge won't relay any information to those trapped inside the building, and it's impossible to seek information from the outside since telephone, Internet, television, and cell-phone access have all been cut off. By the time the quarantine is lifted, the intrepid cameraman's chilling footage provides the only evidence of the horrors that unfolded on that terrible night(n)</desc>

But Tony Stark has a surprise up his sleeve in the form of four amazing teenagers who just might have the power to defeat Ultron once and for all. But will James (son of Captain America and Black Widow), Pym (son of Wasp and Giant Man), Torunn (daughter of Thor) and Azari (son of the Black Panther) truly be capable of defeating the villain who brought about the downfall of their powerful parents? As the battle gets underway and Hawkeye's sharp-shooting son leaps into the fray, the team realizes that they might stand a fighting chance if they can only track down the mission Hulk and encourage him to become a member of the team. Should they succeed in defeating Ultron, this group will forever be known as The Next Avengers(n)</desc>
