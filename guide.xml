    <title lang="en">Toy Story</title>
    <desc lang="en">This innovative and fast-paced adventure, the very first all-computer-generated animated feature film, from Disney and Northern California's Pixar will delight children, techies and everyone in between. It not only features incredibly detailed animation, it also contains a solid, multi-layered story that centers on young Andy's toys. When the boy is around, they behave as normal inanimate playthings, but the minute he leaves, they come to life. Andy's favorite toy, and leader of the close-knit group, is Woody, a cowboy marionette. The other toys include Slinky Dog, Hamm the Piggy Bank, the acerbic Mr. Potato Head, Rex the timid tyrannosaur, and the lovely Bo Peep. Woody enjoys his long-time status as top toy, but his world nearly crumbles when Andy comes home with the dazzling high-tech astronaut toy, "Buzz Lightyear." Not only is Buzz a superhero with neato gadgets that amaze the others; he is also a really nice toy, eager to help the others. Everyone likes him, except for poor usurped Woody, who hates playing second fiddle. If Buzz has one Achilles heel, it is that he doesn't realize that he is a toy. Although Woody initially tries to accept Buzz, his resentment begins to build up until, desperate to regain his favored position with Andy, Woody "accidentally" pushes Buzz out of the window. In the toys' world there is no place more fearful than the outdoors. Sure enough nasty neighbor Sid has a penchant for blowing up toys with firecrackers and using the shattered parts to make monstrous creations that might even scare director Tim Burton. Soon after the incident, basically good-hearted Woody begins feeling guilty and decides he must save Buzz from certain destruction. He and the other toys set out to find him and end up on a riotous, exciting chase to save their friend(n)</desc>

Jeff Talley (Bruce Willis) used to be a hostage negotiator with the Los Angeles Police Department, but after a standoff goes horribly wrong, Talley moves himself and his family to a small, quiet town of Bristo Camino, where he serves as chief of police. When three young criminals attempt to steal a car from a wealthy accountant, the situation quickly spins out of control and the thieves are trapped inside the heavily fortified home, taking the accountant and his family hostage. The Ventura County Sheriff's Department soon arrives on the scene, and Talley eagerly hands over the situation to them, but when he unexpectedly finds himself in telephone contact with one of the children inside, he begins to suspect that the cops are in over their heads. After he's approached by a masked stranger who has an agenda of his own, Talley is forced to decide if he should protect the safety of the family in the house or his own wife and kids.

David Dunne (Willis) is taking a train from New York City back home to Philadelphia after a job interview that didn't go well when his car jumps the tracks and collides with an oncoming engine, with David the only survivor among the 131 passengers on board. Astoundingly, David is not only alive, he hardly seems to have been touched. As David wonders what has happened to him and why he was able to walk away, he encounters a mysterious stranger, Elijah Prince (Samuel L. Jackson), who explains to David that there are a certain number of people who are "unbreakable" -- they have remarkable endurance and courage, a predisposition toward dangerous behavior, and feel invincible but also have strange premonitions of terrible events. Is David "unbreakable"? And if he is, what are the physical and psychological ramifications of this knowledge? Unbreakable also stars Robin Wright-Penn as Audrey, David's wife; the supporting cast includes Spencer Treat Clark and Joey Perillo(n)</desc>

Cameron Diaz stars as Christina Walters, a jaded, club-hopping single woman in Boston who has given up trying to find the perfect mate to focus on "Mr. Right Now." Her equally cynical friend, Courtney (Christina Applegate), a divorce attorney, shares much the same attitude. Christina's life changes forever one evening at a nightclub where she meets Peter Donahue (Thomas Jane), a man she finds adorable and just about perfect. Unfortunately, Peter disappears and all she knows about him is that his brother, Roger (Jason Bateman), is getting married soon and having a bachelor party nearby. When crashing the party doesn't pan out, Courtney suggests they road trip to the wedding and Christina agrees, leading to encounters with a series of obstacles, including some funky leftovers and an insane bank security guard. The Sweetest Thing co-stars Parker Posey and Selma Blair(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Fever Pitch</title>
    <desc lang="en">Nick Hornby's acclaimed memoir about one man's struggle to balance his love of a woman and his love for soccer was the basis of a well-reviewed British film in 1997, and now gets a Americanized rewrite with this picture, in which the game is changed from soccer to baseball. Ben (Jimmy Fallon) is a high-school teacher who meets Lindsay (Drew Barrymore), who has a successful career in business. Ben and Lindsay don't appear to have much in common on the surface, but they hit it off and are soon involved in a serious romance. But when spring rolls around, Lindsay becomes aware of the true love of Ben's life -- the Boston Red Sox. Despite the team's lamentable record, Ben has been a fiercely loyal Red Sox fan since childhood, and Lindsay finds it hard to compete with his passion for baseball, while Ben is forced to choose between the obsessions of his youth and the enthusiasms of a responsible adult. Fever Pitch was shot in part in Boston during the 2004 baseball season, which to the surprise of the filmmakers saw the Red Sox winning baseball's world series for the first time since 1918(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">U-571</title>
    <desc lang="en">In this World War II action thriller, American reconnaissance agents learn that a German submarine is sinking. The doomed ship carries an Enigma Machine, a special coding device that allows high-level Axis forces to send messages that can't be read without a similar encryption mechanism. Obtaining a working Enigma device would be invaluable for the Allied war effort, so a U.S. sub is sent out to rescue the machine. However, German forces have already picked up the sub's distress signal and are en route to rescue their comrades. U-571 features a distinguished cast, including Matthew McConaughey, Bill Paxton, Harvey Keitel, and Jon Bon Jovi(n)</desc>

Montgomery Burns (voice of Harry Shearer) has grown weary of the toil and turmoil that goes into running the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, and while he's initially resistant to the idea of selling the plant, he decides to meet with a group of German investors looking to buy into American energy. In time, Burns decides to sell to the Germans, which is good news for most of the employees, who hold stock in the plant and earn a handsome dividend, but bad news for Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta), who only days earlier sold his shares for 25 dollars and immediately spent the money on cold beer. Homer's poor working habits and general ineptitude make a poor impression on his efficient new employers, and he soon finds himself out of a job. Those who remain at the plant aren't much happier, but oddly enough, Burns fares worst of all -- with no power over his former employees, Burns discovers to his horror that no one fears him anymore, and people no longer hesitate to tell him what they really think of him.

Lisa starts by watching football with her Dad, and Homer soon discovers Lisa has a near flawless knack for picking the winners of each week's games. Thanks to Lisa's shrewd analysis of the teams and the players, Homer actually starts winning his weekly bets placed with neighborhood bartender Moe (voice of Hank Azaria), but while Lisa is initially happy to be spending quality time with her father -- and getting plenty of new toys to boot -- when she learns about Homer's gambling, she's crushed, certain her father cares more about winning his bets than he does about her.

    <desc lang="en">A Streetcar Named Marge. Looking for something to break the monotony of her life as a housewife, Marge Simpson (voice of Julie Kavner) auditions for the Springfield Community Center's upcoming production of Streetcar! -- a musical adaptation of A Streetcar Named Desire. The director, melodramatic Llewllyn Sinclair (voice of Jon Lovitz), isn't impressed at first by Marge's audition, but after hearing her talk to Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta), he's convinced she's just the woman to play Blanche DuBois opposite Ned Flanders (voice of Harry Shearer), who was cast because he looks better with his shirt off than anyone else who tried out. Homer doesn't think much of Marge's new interest in theater, and her anger at her husband gives her performance a keen emotional edge, but will this rift in their marriage prove irreparable? Meanwhile, since Marge is busy with rehearsals, she sends baby Maggie to a daycare center, the Ayn Rand School for Tots, where the staff is determined to keep the children away from their pacifiers; Maggie, however, isn't about to give it up without a fight. A Streetcar Named Marge first aired on October 1, 1992(n)</desc>

Valentine's Day has come to Springfield Elementary School, and while the rest of his classmates have gotten cards from their fellow students, intellectually challenged Ralph Wiggum (voice of Nancy Cartwright) hasn't received a single valentine. Lisa (voice of Yeardley Smith) feels sorry for poor Ralph, so she erases the name from a card she was given and passes it along to Ralph. Convinced she likes him, Ralph quickly develops a major crush on Lisa, but the more time she spends with Ralph, the more Lisa is convinced she doesn't feel anything for him but a mixture of annoyance and pity. Ralph tries to win Lisa's heart with Malibu Stacy accessories and tickets to the Krusty the Clown Anniversary Special, where Lisa is prodded into admitting on the air that she doesn't like Ralph, breaking his heart. Lisa feels awful about hurting Ralph's feelings, and her heart sinks even deeper when she discovers she has won the female lead in the school play, portraying Martha Washington -- and that her leading man will be Ralph, cast as George. I Love Lisa was first aired on February 11, 1993, just in time for Valentine's Day(n)</desc>

Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) proves to astoundingly inept, bringing the test's phony plant to the point of a meltdown, and Homer is ordered to return to school and pass a course in Nuclear Physics before he can return to his job. Homer enrolls in Springfield University after Mr. Burns (voice of Harry Shearer) intercedes on his behalf, but true to form, Homer's notion of academia seem to be informed more clearly by bad 1980s college comedies rather than the pursuit of higher learning. With his grades going steadily downhill, Homer is introduced to three science students who will be his tutors, Doug (voice of Hank Azaria), Gary (voice of Dan Castellaneta), and Ben (voice of Harry Shearer). Homer is more interested in teaching his nerdy new friends the fine art of partying rather than doing schoolwork, and after Homer talks them into stealing the mascot of crosstown rivals Springfield A&amp;M, Doug, Gary, and Ben are kicked out of school.

So far back as anyone can remember, Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) has never gotten along with his annoyingly good-natured neighbor Ned Flanders (voice of Harry Shearer), but when Homer is stuck without tickets for the upcoming Springfield vs. Shelbyville football game and Ned wins a pair of tickets, Homer grudgingly agrees to go along. The game turns out to be a near-perfect day for Homer: the seats for the game are great, Flanders springs for drinks and snacks, Springfield wins the game, and after being presented with the game ball, Ned gives it to Homer. Suddenly, Homer has decided that Ned is his new best friend, and begins spending even less time with his family to hang out with Flanders. Ned, however, soon discovers a little time with Homer goes a long way, and suddenly their attitudes have been reversed -- Homer is the well-meaning friendly one, while Flanders is the cranky guy who keeps wishing his neighbor would go away. "Homer Loves Flanders" was first aired on February 24, 1994(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Bart Gets an Elephant. Bill and Marty (voices of Dan Castellaneta and Harry Shearer), wacky morning drive-time DJ's on Springfield's radio station KBBL, are staging a new contest in which the winner gets to choose between two prizes -- a full grown African elephant or 10,000 dollars. Bart Simpson (voice of Nancy Cartwright) ends up winning the contest, and decides he wants the elephant. Bill and Marty were never expecting anyone to actually choose the elephant, and tell Bart they don't have one to give him. Bart refuses to change his mind, and after the local media picks up on the story, KBBL relents and gives Bart an elephant, which he calls Stampy. Bart loves his new pet, but Stampy is less than excited about his new environment, while Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) and Marge (voice of Julie Kavner) aren't sure how they'll pay for the elephant's feeding and upkeep, and Lisa (voice of Yeardley Smith) believes Stampy should be in a jungle, where he belongs. Eventually, Homer and Marge put their feet down and tell Bart that Stampy can't stay with them; an animal sanctuary is willing to take Stampy, but they can't pay anything for him, while a less than scrupulous ivory dealer is willing to give the Simpsons a big check for the elephant, but he would almost certainly kill the animal.

    <desc lang="en">Secrets of a Successful Marriage. While no one has ever accused Homer Simpson (voice of Dan Castellaneta) of being an intellectual heavyweight, one day he finally tires of people suggesting he's stupid and decides to enroll in an adult education course. He soon discovers, though, that most of the classes he's interested in are being taught by family and friends, and he's too intimidated to attend. Instead, Homer signs up to teach a class of his own on how to have a successful marriage; however, since he doesn't have much to say, most of his students look bored to tears until he starts telling secrets about his wife, Marge (voice of Julie Kavner), including the fact that she dyes her hair and gets turned on when Homer nibbles her elbow. When word of this gets back to Marge, she's understandably furious, and orders Homer not to talk about her in class. But the next time Homer runs out of material in class, he relapses into stories about Marge, and she kicks him out of the house. Marge begins to seriously consider following the advice of Reverend Lovejoy (voice of Harry Shearer) and divorce Homer, while Homer moves into Bart's tree house, desperate to win his wife back.

The new pool makes the Simpsons the most popular family in the neighborhood, but Bart doesn't get much of a chance to enjoy his new status; he soon breaks his leg while trying to dive into the pool from his tree house. For the most part confined to his room, Bart wiles away his time by spying on the neighbors with a telescope, and one night he sees Ned Flanders (voice of Harry Shearer) digging what looks like a grave in his back yard. Bart then overhears Ned saying "I'm a murderer!" and comes to the conclusion that Ned has snapped and killed his wife, Maude (voice of Maggie Roswell). Bart and Lisa soon start playing detective, determined to uncover the evidence of Ned's wrongdoing. "Bart of Darkness" was first aired on September 4, 1994(n)</desc>

Allison Taylor (voice of Winona Ryder) is bright, a top student, and even a gifted saxophone player, and while Lisa ought to be friends with Allison, she's confused and a bit angry at the notion of being second best for the first time. After taking the first chair in the school band's saxophone section away from Lisa, Allison looks to be a shoo-in to win the coveted diorama competition; unable to beat Allison's best efforts, Lisa accepts an offer from Bart (voice of Nancy Cartwright) to sabotage Allison's presentation. Meanwhile, Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) finds 100 pounds of sugar lying by the side of the road after a truck crashes; Homer is convinced he's found a windfall that will earn him a fortune, while Marge tries to convince him you can't sell dirty sugar door to door.

Bart Simpson (voice of Nancy Cartwright) plays one of his more elaborate pranks on Principal Seymour Skinner (voice of Harry Shearer) when he decorates a weather balloon launched by the principal so that it will resemble Skinner, bearing a sign which reads "Big Butt Skinner." As punishment, Bart has to help Skinner with his astronomy research at 4:30 a.m. each morning, but as luck would have it, while Skinner is off his watch, Bart discovers a new and unseen comet, which is named for the boy. While Bart is at first lionized for his find (much to Skinner's annoyance), it quickly becomes obvious that the comet is headed right for Springfield, and could very well destroy the town. After attempts to fend off the comet fail, doomsday fever sweeps Springfield, and several people discover that Ned Flanders (voice of Harry Shearer) is one of the only folks in town with a shelter capable of withstanding the comet. While Flanders unwittingly becomes savior of the community, everyone has to ask the question "Who should stay and who should go in Springfield" when it becomes obvious not everyone who wanted a shelter bothered to build one.

    <desc lang="en">A Star Is Burns. The citizens of Springfield decide they need to spruce up the town's image, and Marge Simpson (voice of Julie Kavner) suggests that sponsoring a Springfield Film Festival might be a good way to do it. The idea is enthusiastically received, and Marge is able to persuade well-known film critic Jay Sherman (voice of Jon Lovitz) to lead the jury. Though overweight and balding, Jay has charm and wit where Homer (voice of Dan Castellaneta) does not, and after Jay wins over Marge and her sisters, Patty and Selma (both voiced by Julie Kavner), Homer insists on being made a judge for the festival in order to prove his intelligence and sophistication. However, while most of the jury is moved to tears by a film about the tragedy of alcoholism by Barney Gumble (voice of Dan Castellaneta), which bears the unfortunate title "Puke-ahontas," Homer is insistent upon handing the grand prize to a minute-long short in which Hans Moleman (voice of Dan Castellaneta) is hit in the crotch with a football. Meanwhile, C. Montgomery Burns (voice of Harry Shearer) wants to refurbish his image as an aging, cold-hearted energy czar, and decides to make a film about himself, "A Burns for All Seasons," which is to be directed either by Steven Spielberg, or his nonunion Mexican equivalent. "A Star Is Burns" introduced the character of Jay Sherman, who a few weeks later debuted in his own animated series, The Critic, which was produced by several members of the creative team behind The Simpsons.

    <title lang="en">Cocktail</title>
    <desc lang="en">After being discharged from the Army, Brian Flanagan (Tom Cruise) moves back to Queens and takes a job in a bar run by Doug Coughlin (Bryan Brown), who teaches Brian the fine art of bartending. Brian quickly becomes a patron favorite with his flashy drink-mixing style. Brian adopts his mentor's cynical philosophy on life and goes for the money. He leaves his artist girlfriend Jordan Mooney (Elisabeth Shue) for Bonnie (Lisa Banes), a wealthy, high-powered executive. Brian soon must chose between the two, as he evaluates his options. Scriptwriter Heywood Gould displayed his sense of humor when assigning the character name "Mr. Mooney" to Lucille Ball's real-life son-in-law, actor Laurence Luckenbill. Television fans of The Lucy Show will recall Mr. Mooney, played by Gale Gordon, as Lucy's fussy financial boss. The film is more memorable for the 17-song soundtrack and plays like a series of MTV videos. Cocktail was a big draw at the box office in 1988(n)</desc>

The title of the program is derived from a phrase used by the soldiers to indicate the day that they cheated death during combat -- often with horrific, life-altering wounds that left them permanently disabled(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Cocktail</title>
    <desc lang="en">After being discharged from the Army, Brian Flanagan (Tom Cruise) moves back to Queens and takes a job in a bar run by Doug Coughlin (Bryan Brown), who teaches Brian the fine art of bartending. Brian quickly becomes a patron favorite with his flashy drink-mixing style. Brian adopts his mentor's cynical philosophy on life and goes for the money. He leaves his artist girlfriend Jordan Mooney (Elisabeth Shue) for Bonnie (Lisa Banes), a wealthy, high-powered executive. Brian soon must chose between the two, as he evaluates his options. Scriptwriter Heywood Gould displayed his sense of humor when assigning the character name "Mr. Mooney" to Lucille Ball's real-life son-in-law, actor Laurence Luckenbill. Television fans of The Lucy Show will recall Mr. Mooney, played by Gale Gordon, as Lucy's fussy financial boss. The film is more memorable for the 17-song soundtrack and plays like a series of MTV videos. Cocktail was a big draw at the box office in 1988(n)</desc>

Today, Dre runs a successful record label, and Sidney is a respected music journalist; both have managed to turn their love for the music into careers, and both are still close friends. Close enough, in fact, that many of their pals wonder why they've never become boyfriend and girlfriend. While both have always denied their attraction to one another, Sidney begins to have second thoughts when Dre proposes to his girlfriend Reese (Nicole Ari Parker), a lawyer. Even though Sidney has a relationship of her own with professional basketball player Kelby (Boris Kodjoe), as Dre's wedding draws closer, Sidney begins to suspect that her longtime best friend is actually the love of her life. Brown Sugar features supporting performances form real life Hip Hop stars Mos Def and Queen Latifah; former basketball star Earvin "Magic" Johnson served as executive producer(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In Gary Winick's romantic comedy, Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway star as best friends competing to nab the same location for their wedding reception. When Liv and Emma were girls they attended such an impressive wedding at New York's landmark Plaza Hotel that they swore that, when the time came, they would each celebrate their nuptials there. Twenty years later, after saying 'yes' to their respective fiancés, they've instructed their wedding planner to book the ceremony of their dreams. But because of a clerical error they're both given the same slot - and neither is willing to concede. Instead, their friendship is jettisoned as they resort to underhand tactics in a bid to sabotage each other and fulfil their marriage fantasies...

    <title lang="en">The Astronaut Farmer</title>
    <desc lang="en">An aspiring astronaut who was forced to forsake his dream of exploring space in order to save the family farm begins building his own personal rocket as a means of reaching the stars in this quirky rural drama starring Billy Bob Thornton. There once was a time when Charlie Farmer (Thornton) seemed like a shoo-in for NASA's esteemed astronaut training program. An Air Force pilot who held a degree in aerospace engineering, Charlie was well on his way to blasting off when a family crisis grounded his celestial aspirations. Of course, Charlie's feet may be firmly planted on terra firma these days, but his thoughts are constantly ascending into the clouds and beyond. It's been ten long years since the man who would navigate the stars began tending to the family farm, and during that time, Charlie has dedicated every moment of his spare time to building the rocket that will one day launch him into space. Though his devoted wife, Audie (Virginia Madsen), the pair's three children, Sunshine, Stanley, and Shepard, and even his father-in-law, Hal (Bruce Dern), all support Charlie in achieving his lifelong goal of becoming the nation's first independent astronaut, a last-minute hitch on the eve before the big launch unexpectedly stalls Charlie's countdown. It seems that Charlie's quest to obtain a substantial amount of high-grade rocket fuel has attracted the attention of not only the FBI, but the CIA, the FAA, and the United States military as well. Now, as the powers that be attempt to ground Charlie, citing concerns for civilian safety, a media frenzy descends upon the once-quiet farm as the reluctant renegade hero vows to show his children just how far one's courage and willingness to pursue one's own ideals can get a person when one refuses to give up hope. Northfork writing/directing duo Mark and Michael Polish team up to tell the tale of a man considered an oddity by his neighbors, a criminal by the government, and an inspiration by the media and the people(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day. For decades, when children have a bad day, they have turned to the pages of Judith Viorst's hilarious book Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day for consolation. A multiple award-winning video from Sony Wonder, Alexander is the story of a boy whose day just keeps getting worse from the moment he wakes up with gum in his hair. He fights with his brother, breaks his favorite toy, gets in trouble with his parents, and with each mishap, he proclaims "That's it. I'm moving to Australia!" But at the end of the story, Alexander's mom reminds him that everyone has days like this -- even in Australia. This is a great learning tool to teach young children about dealing with anger and the unpredictability of life. Recommended for ages three to seven. This video has received the following awards: Bronze Medal -- Houston International Film &amp; Video Festival, Bronze Apple -- National Educational Film &amp; Video Festival, Bronze Plaque -- Columbus International Film &amp; Video Festival, and the Parents' Choice Award(n)</desc>

Adapted from the best-selling book by author Jim Stovall, The Ultimate Gift opens as trust-fund baby Jason Stevens (Drew Fuller) prepares to receive a sizable inheritance from his late grandfather Red (James Garner). Though Jason is convinced that the money is about to come flowing in, he receives a sudden shock upon discovering that Red has instead decided to offer him something much more valuable than simple cash. Realizing that his spoiled grandson has lived a sheltered life in which he has always been handed the very best of everything, Red has devised a crash course in living comprised of 12 gifts that will challenge the arrogant young man in ways that he could never have imagined nor anticipated. In the weeks that follow, Jason will befriend a terminally ill child (Abigail Breslin) and her grief-stricken mother (Ali Hillis) while attempting to determine whether it is money or happiness that truly matters in life. Brian Dennehy and Lee Meriwether co-star in an uplifting drama from the director of The Ride and One Night with the King(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Four years after her bout of demonic possession, Regan MacNeil seems at peace as she enjoys a privileged but lonely adolescence. Her actress mother, absent on-location, leaves her in the care of her childhood nanny, Sharon, who feels inextricably bound to her young charge despite the terror she endured during the girl's possession. Regan attends frequent counseling sessions with Dr. Gene Tuskin, an unorthodox psychologist who believes Regan remembers more of her ordeal than she admits. Meanwhile, Father Lamont, a protégé of the priest who died exorcising Regan, is called to investigate the death of his mentor. The Church is divided over the teachings of Father Merrin and wants to gather documentation of his views about demonic existence. Father Lamont himself is conflicted -- haunted by images of a possessed woman he could not save. As he and Dr. Tuskin become convinced that the demon still exhibits a hold on Regan, the priest sojourns to Africa in search of Kokuma, who as a boy was possessed by the same demon and exorcised by Father Merrin. Learning the true name and ancient origins of his supernatural foe, Lamont returns to America to stage a climactic battle for Regan's soul(n)</desc>

Joy Robertson (Daphne Zuniga) is the kind of mom who likes to make the Christmas season special. But this year, something is different. Joy has started to feel as if her family simply expects her to drop everything to cook, buy presents, and decorate the house. When Joy responds by calling a halt to the familiar Christmas traditions, she is quickly joined by the rest of the mothers in her neighborhood. Now the more steam Joy's movement gains, the faster her once quiet town spirals into complete chaos(n)</desc>

The first episode in Ken Burns' spectacular documentary of America's favorite pastime takes us from baseball's origins in the 1840s to the dawning of a new century, when glorious moments were captured in still photos rather than newsreel footage. Learn about the valuable contributions of Albert Goodwill Spaulding and Harry Wright, and recall some of the century's great players such as King Kelly, Cap Anson, and Cy Young. Burns highlights great teams like the Cincinnati Red Stockings and the Baltimore Orioles, and provides the background of those less glorious moments, when Moses Fleetwood Walker and all other Negroes were expelled from the major leagues. Also told is the story of John Montgomery Ward's efforts to establish a players' union. Ken Burns' Baseball: Inning 1 -- Our Game is a powerful and informative first inning for this classic baseball series(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Faith of 50 Million People. The third inning of Ken Burns' nine-inning documentary leads us into the Roaring '20s, but not before hitting the sport's stumbling block that was the Black Sox World Series scandal of 1919. Charles Comisky's stingy handling of the Chicago White Sox, who would eventually throw the series against the Reds, was tempered by the success of the Athletics under Connie Mack. Kenesaw Mountain Landis became baseball's first Commissioner, making headlines both by banning the Black Sox for life, and by approving the sale of George H. Ruth from the Red Sox to the Yankees for 125,000 dollars. The dark cloud of scandal was about to be cleared away by a new hero(n)</desc>

The stories of great Negro League players such as Satchel Paige, Josh Gibson, Cool Papa Bell, Judy Johnson, and Buck Leonard help set the stage for the history-making moment in 1942 when Jackie Robinson walked onto Ebbet's Field for the first time. Back in the Major Leagues, the program focuses on Lou Gehrig and Joe DiMaggio, the Yankees' challenge to Dizzy Dean and the Gas House Gang St. Louis Cardinals, and the impact of the Great Depression as inspiration for the first All-Star game(n)</desc>

The previous five "innings" of Ken Burns' sweeping baseball documentary set the stage for the triumphant moment in this sixth episode when Jackie Robinson takes the field in his first Major League game for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1942, an event of enormous personal and social significance. Other personal achievements of the decade included Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak and Ted Williams' .406 batting average in 1941. Burns also highlights the state of baseball during World War II, rescued, in part, by the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. The decade ended with the death of the legendary Babe Ruth(n)</desc>

New York held sway in the world of baseball from 1950-1960, and the seventh episode -- or "inning" -- of Ken Burns' documentary series focuses on the dominating forces of the Yankees, Dodgers, and Giants. At least one of these teams played in every World Series between 1949 and 1958, and six of those series saw the Yankees pitted against either the Dodgers or the Giants. Yogi Berra and Mickey Mantle of the Yankees, Jackie Robinson and Roy Campanella of the Dodgers, as well as Willie Mays and Bobby Thompson of the Giants are just some of the legendary players who lit up the newsreel clips and increasingly popular TV screens. It was a decade of moving franchises, as the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles, the Giants to San Francisco, and the Braves to Milwaukee. But in the seventh inning, the game is far from over(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">(2006) Neil Burger's period mystery-romance starring Edward Norton, Jessica Biel and Paul Giamatti. In 1900s VIenna there's only one show in town - and that's the one featuring mesmeric entertainer Eisenheim (Norton). His magical abilities are wowing the crowds, with an act that ranges from mere tricks to an apparent capacity to raise the dead. However, he has also long been in love with Duchess Sophie von Teschen (Biel), which puts him in dangerous competition with the violent, scheming Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell). And, after Eisenheim uses one of his performances as an opportunity to humiliate the Crown Prince, Leopold jumps at the opportunity to have the magician arrested by Inspector Uhl (Giamatti) on grounds of necromancy. It's only then, during Eisenheim's interrogation, that we learn the full story of his life and the political plot upon which he's stumbled... M,W,S,HD(n)</desc>

There, the couple are repeatedly warned that the forest can be a dangerous place at night -- warnings that go unheeded by Jim as he single-mindedly focuses on making the journey he's dreamt about for years. Later, in the darkened woods, however, the once-carefree couple experience paralyzing fear when someone -- or something -- begins rooting around their campsite, and uttering inhuman howls. Uncertain if they've actually survived an encounter with Bigfoot or simply fallen victim to a cruel prank by the locals, Jim and Kelly agree to pack their bags, and return to civilization at sunrise.

The stories of legend are true, and the magical relics owned by such celebrated figures as Cinderella really exist. The malevolent force known as The Krugen knows well that the owner of these objects will reap ultimate power, because by obtaining the magical mirror once owned by the Evil Queen who tormented Snow White, they were able to herald the arrival of the Dark Ages. Centuries later, former Hunter Mason has become a loyal servant of The Krugen. He knows that once he locates all of the pieces of the mirror no one will be able to challenge his evil reign. But Jordyn and Carter Flynn hail from a long line of Hunters, and they've got just the skills to prevent Mason from achieving his diabolical plan. When Jordyn and Carter learn that their parents have gone missing during an important mission, they vow to track them down, and head off a disaster that could alter the entire course of history(n)</desc>

When 17-year-old Johnjo gives his cousin and his friends a lift in his brother's car, he is unaware they are going to confront a local loudmouth who they feel needs putting in his place. As Johnjo waits in the car, one of them takes offence with an innocent bystander, who is fatally stabbed. The murder victim is the eldest child of Margaret and Tommy Ward, who has become estranged from his family after a bitter divorce. Struggling to make ends meet on her own, Margaret is nevertheless determined to fight through bureaucracy and the cool indifference of the banks to give Thomas the send-off he deserves. Johnjo makes his own way to the police station and lays the blame squarely with Kieran. However, career copper DI Hastings wants everyone possible to be tried for murder, and with the joint enterprise doctrine at his disposal, that includes Johnjo(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In 'Brooklyn's Finest', we're taken on a dark ride through the streets of Brooklyn, following three New York Police officers as they wrestle with temptation while attempting to uphold the law and deal with the pressures of the job. Eddie (Richard Gere) is a bitter and disillusioned veteran cop who's a week away from retirement. Tango (Don Cheadle) is an undercover narcotics cop who tries desperately to leave the streets and earn a promotion to a desk job. Much like Eddie, he's lost sight of his priorities and his loyalties seem to lie more with notorious inner-city drug dealer Caz (Wesley Snipes) than with the boys in blue. At the same time, narcotics detective Sal is a family man in despair and needs to raise money to buy a better house for his family. In seven days, the lives of all three officers will converge at one crime scene(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">An apolitical South African oil-refinery worker and soccer coach is forced into terrorism as a means of fighting back against the brutality of the apartheid regime in director Phillip Noyce's dramatic look at the life of one-time political prisoner and freedom fighter Patrick Chamusso. In the 1980s, Patrick (Derek Luke) and his wife Precious (Bonnie Henna) lived a peaceful life until one fateful day, when on an overnight trip with his team, Patrick is singled out as the prime suspect in a bombing at the refinery. Placed in solitary confinement, with his wife and family brutalized by government agent Nic Vos (Tim Robbins), the young family man is eventually cleared of charges, but his life is in shambles. Devastated and distraught, Patrick soon begins working as a rebel fighter and political operative for Nelson Mandela's African National Congress. As the oppressed country's powerful apartheid regime continues to torture and torment its citizens, the now-radicalized Patrick must disappear from his family without a trace and go undercover if he is to aid in toppling the system that destroyed his family, and forever changed his outlook on the world(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Stuart Little</title>
    <desc lang="en">E.B. White's classic children's story is brought to the screen in this fantasy, which combines computer-animated characters with a cast of live actors. Mrs. Little (Geena Davis), Mr. Little (Hugh Laurie), and their son George (Jonathan Lipnicki) live in a brownstone near New York's Central Park. The Littles have decided to adopt a younger brother for George, and while they're meeting the children at an orphanage, they are greeted by a mouse named Stuart (voice of Michael J. Fox), who can talk, walk upright, wear clothes, and do nearly anything a human child can do. The Littles are so taken with Stuart that they decide to adopt him, and soon the rest of the family is just as charmed by Stuart -- with the possible exception of Snowbell (voice of Nathan Lane), their house cat. The cast of humans includes Jennifer Tilly, Bruno Kirby, and Dabney Coleman; animal voices are contributed by Chazz Palminteri and Steve Zahn, Jim Doughan, and David Alan Grier(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Ratatouille</title>
    <desc lang="en">A scrawny rat named Remy (voice of Patton Oswalt) finds his dreams of culinary superstardom stirring up sizable controversy in the kitchen of a fine French restaurant in director Brad Bird's madcap computer-animated comedy. It's hard being a rat with culinary aspirations, but Remy is convinced he has what it takes to break the stereotypes and follow in the footsteps of star chef Auguste Gusteau (voice of Brad Garrett). As fate would have it, Remy is currently situated in the sewers directly beneath Gusteau's elegant restaurant. Soon Remy teams up with a young chef with little talent named Linguini (voice of Lou Romano). Together they are able to create some fabulous dishes, but they live in fear that someone will discover their secret and object strenuously to a rat being in a kitchen. When Remy's passion for cooking turns the haughty world of French cuisine upside down, the rat who would be king of the kitchen learns important lessons about life, friends, and family while questioning whether he should pursue his culinary calling or simply go back underground and return to his life as a sewer rat(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Shrek</title>
    <desc lang="en">Classic fairy tales get a vigorous working over in this comic, computer-animated fantasy based on the children's book by William Steig. Mike Meyers stars as Shrek, a green ogre who's perfectly content to live alone in a vast swamp, until it's suddenly overrun with refugees such as The Three Bears, Pinocchio, The Seven Dwarves, Cinderella, and many others. It seems that the evil and very short Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) has ordered the storybook denizens of his realm, Duloc, to be summarily deported. Shrek confronts Farquaad, accompanied by a wisecracking Donkey (Eddie Murphy), and the disgruntled ogre is offered a deal: Farquaad desires to marry Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), but she's being held captive by a dragon in a far-off realm. Rescue Fiona and return her to Duloc, and Shrek's swamp will once again be his own. So begins a series of adventures for Shrek and his trusty "steed." Shrek also stars Linda Hunt(n)</desc>
