The most spectacular place he visits is so high up in the mountains that it's only accessible by helicopter, but this difficulty is more than made up for by the views seen from it. Back in Britain, George meets a man turning a wrecked private jet into a crash pad and a Gypsy tattoo artist with big plans for an old railway carriage. George also challenges his pal, craftsman Will Hardie, to create a woodland retreat for less than the price of a family holiday.(n)</desc>

It's 1971. One all-white school and one all-black school have been forcibly merged, and a black coach appointed over the existing white football coach. It could be a recipe for disaster, but the two men shares certain qualities: integrity, honour and a strong work ethic. Together they mould a group of angry, disillusioned young men into a dynamic, winning football team - and provide a model for future integration. A top class film with a superb cast(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Director/screenwriter David Gordon Green adapts Stewart O'Nan's popular novel to the screen in this feature, which tells the parallel tales of a teenager named Arthur (Michael Angarano) and his onetime babysitter Annie (Kate Beckinsale) -- whose turbulent relationship with her estranged husband, Glenn (Sam Rockwell), leads the small-town waitress down a troubled path. Arthur is a high-school student from a dysfunctional family, and does everything in his power to avoid hanging around the house while mom and dad quarrel. When he's not practicing his trombone and performing with the high-school marching band, Arthur can usually be found bussing tables at the local Chinese restaurant and flirting with older waitress Annie. Annie used to be Arthur's babysitter, and is currently struggling to separate from her former high-school sweetheart, Glenn. But being a single mother isn't easy, especially since the troubled Glenn wants nothing more than to clean up his act and reunite his family. Back at school, Arthur and pretty classmate Lila (Olivia Thirlby) have been bonding over their mutual love for all things geeky. Though the casual friendship shows promise of evolving into something more when Lila expresses her true feelings for Arthur, he can't help but becoming distracted by his chaotic family life: his father is moving out of the family home, and his mother is doing everything in her power to maintain some semblance of normalcy. Realizing that happiness is fleeting as his family becomes shattered and Annie experiences a series of distressing encounters with Glenn, Arthur gradually begins to fall for Lisa despite his growing cynicism concerning long-term relationships. Later, on a cold winter morning, Glenn and Annie's past catches up with them in a blinding flash, and the lives of everyone they know are suddenly and irrevocably changed(n)</desc>

This is a favorite among Stooge fans because of a novelty song that Curly sings as he teaches it to his students, "Swingin' the Alphabet."(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">It's not unusual to see two women fighting over the same man in a movie, only this time it's his mother and his fiancée vying for his attention in this broad comedy. While Charlotte Cantilini (Jennifer Lopez), known to her friends as Charlie, has never had much luck in her love life, one day her ship arrives in a big way when she meets Kevin Fields (Michael Vartan), a doctor who is charming, handsome, and wealthy. Kevin also has a famous mother, Viola Fields (Jane Fonda), who has enjoyed a long and successful career as a news broadcaster. When Kevin and Charlie fall head over heels for one another, he opts to propose marriage to her as he's introducing Charlie to Viola over lunch. However, as far as Viola is concerned, this could not come at a worse time -- Viola has just been fired from the anchor desk, and regards her son as the only anchor left in her life. Not willing to share Kevin with anyone, Viola sets out to sabotage his relationship with Charlie in any way she can, often with the wary assistance of her secretary Ruby (Wanda Sykes). But once Charlie gets wind of Viola's schemes, she decides two can play this game. Monster-in-Law marked Jane Fonda's return to the screen after a long leave of absence; it was her first film after co-starring with Robert De Niro in 1990's Stanley &amp; Iris(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Inspired by The Canterbury Tales, as well as the story of Ulrich von Lichtenstein, this is the story of William, a young squire with a gift for jousting. After his master dies suddenly, the squire hits the road with his cohorts Roland and Wat. On the journey, they stumble across an unknown writer, Chaucer.

Night Shyamalan writes and directs this self-proclaimed, grown-up "bedtime story" about an apartment building superintendent named Cleveland (Paul Giamatti) who discovers a magical sea-nymph named Story (Bryce Dallas Howard) who's been transported to this world and is living in the building's own swimming pool. As this bizarre revelation sinks in, Cleveland becomes enraptured by her other-worldly charm. As he shelters her in his apartment, other inhabitants of the building begin falling into place as representations of characters from an Eastern myth in which these mermaids, or "narfs," co-exist unhappily with more beastly and violent characters. In human reality, the forces of darkness that threaten the heroes of a fairy tale prove to be much more terrifying, and the victory of good over evil is by no means guaranteed. Jeffery Wright, Jared Harris and Mary Beth Hurt co-star, as well as Shyamalan himself, playing the visionary writer Vick(n)</desc>

The actress and presenter looks into the rumoured French ancestry on her mother's side of the family, an investigation that leads to an extraordinary Napoleonic-era cross-Channel romance.

    <desc lang="en">The candidates have to push their imagination and design skills to the limit to create their own virtual-reality games, before pitching them to enthusiasts and industry experts at the world-famous London Comic Con exhibition. One team opts for an undersea game, while the other reaches for the stars. However, one project manager loses patience when a giggling sub-team fails to take the task seriously enough. On pitch day, the reality of speaking to the largest audience in Apprentice history causes nerves to take hold. The audience then votes for their favourite game, and when the results are announced in the boardroom, it will be `game over' for at least one of the hopefuls.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Walliams &amp; Friend</title>
    <desc lang="en">Seemingly estraged professionally speaking from Little Britain and Come Fly with Me sidekick Matt Lucas for the time being, David Walliams continues to partner with up alternative comic talent. Here, he and latest `friend' Harry Enfield appear as John Torode and a rather fussy Gregg Wallace in a MasterChef parody. They also portray a pair of ageing lotharios and take a look back at some of Harry's comedy characters that never saw the light of day - until a certain Mr Walliams got his hands on them. With Morgana Robinson, Mike Wozniak and Jason Lewis.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The candidates have to push their imagination and design skills to the limit to create their own virtual-reality games, before pitching them to enthusiasts and industry experts at the world-famous London Comic Con exhibition. One team opts for an undersea game, while the other reaches for the stars. However, one project manager loses patience when a giggling sub-team fails to take the task seriously enough. On pitch day, the reality of speaking to the largest audience in Apprentice history causes nerves to take hold. The audience then votes for their favourite game, and when the results are announced in the boardroom, it will be `game over' for at least one of the hopefuls.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Macclesfield Town v Oxford United (Kick-off 7.55pm). Dan Walker presents coverage of the second-round match, which takes place at Moss Rose. Both of these sides know that they are just 90 minutes away from a place in the third round, which has the potential to provide them with a memorable match against a Premier League side, not to mention a welcome financial boost. Given their non-league status, the hosts first had to come through the qualifying stage before making it to the first-round proper, and secured their place in the world's oldest domestic competition with a 4-1 triumph away to fellow National League outfit North Ferriby United in the fourth qualifying round. The Silkmen then progressed to this stage following a shock 1-0 victory away to League One Walsall, so will be full of confidence as they face another side from the third tier of English football, although the U's will also be buoyed by their first-round performance, which saw them record a 5-0 win away to non-league Merstham of the Isthmian League Premier Division.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Parenthood</title>
    <desc lang="en">This feel-good ensemble comedy tracks a quartet of suburban siblings and their families over the course of a single summer. Hardworking Gil Buckman (Steve Martin) and his stay-at-home wife, Karen (Mary Steeenburgen), have just a few months to help their oldest son, Kevin (Jasen Fisher), overcome his high-strung behavior problems before he'll be relegated to special-education classes. Gil's difficult relationship with his own father, Frank (Jason Robards), has led him to become a would-be super-dad for his three kids, so he takes his son's difficulties more than a little personally. Gil's sister, Helen (Dianne Wiest), is trying to raise a moody, adolescent son (Leaf Phoenix) and an independent-minded daughter (Martha Plimpton) with no help from her well-off ex-husband, who's more interested in his new wife and family. Gil and Helen's sister, Susan (Harley Jane Kozak), meanwhile, must participate in the too-scripted Big Life Plans of her anal-retentive husband, Nathan (Rick Moranis), whose overachiever zeal infects even their toddler daughter. When long-lost brother Larry (Tom Hulce) show up with yet another get-rich-quick scheme, he brings with him a surprise addition to the family. Screenwriters Babaloo Mandel, Lowell Ganz, and Ron Howard negotiate their varied subplots with a deftness and comedic touch that transforms this conflicted clan into a suburban everyfamily(n)</desc>

Paul Duncan (Greg Kinnear) and his wife, Jessie (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), are the proud parents of a bright, happy, and healthy eight-year-old son, Adam (Cameron Bright). Paul and Jessie are highly devoted to Adam, and are devastated when he's killed in a freak auto accident. The Duncans are still stricken with grief when they're approached by Dr. Richard Wells (Robert De Niro), who makes a startling proposal -- Wells operates an experimental fertility clinic, and he's developed a technique by which an embryo could be created from cloned cells taken from their late son, which would be implanted in Jessie's womb. Nine months later, Jessie would give birth to a child exactly like Adam in every way. While Paul and Jessie are initially shocked by this suggestion, in time they decide to give Adam the chance to grow to adulthood and they take up Wells on his offer. The cloned Adam is born healthy and content, and all seems to be well until the child begins to approach his eighth birthday, when events take a startling turn(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Parenthood</title>
    <desc lang="en">This feel-good ensemble comedy tracks a quartet of suburban siblings and their families over the course of a single summer. Hardworking Gil Buckman (Steve Martin) and his stay-at-home wife, Karen (Mary Steeenburgen), have just a few months to help their oldest son, Kevin (Jasen Fisher), overcome his high-strung behavior problems before he'll be relegated to special-education classes. Gil's difficult relationship with his own father, Frank (Jason Robards), has led him to become a would-be super-dad for his three kids, so he takes his son's difficulties more than a little personally. Gil's sister, Helen (Dianne Wiest), is trying to raise a moody, adolescent son (Leaf Phoenix) and an independent-minded daughter (Martha Plimpton) with no help from her well-off ex-husband, who's more interested in his new wife and family. Gil and Helen's sister, Susan (Harley Jane Kozak), meanwhile, must participate in the too-scripted Big Life Plans of her anal-retentive husband, Nathan (Rick Moranis), whose overachiever zeal infects even their toddler daughter. When long-lost brother Larry (Tom Hulce) show up with yet another get-rich-quick scheme, he brings with him a surprise addition to the family. Screenwriters Babaloo Mandel, Lowell Ganz, and Ron Howard negotiate their varied subplots with a deftness and comedic touch that transforms this conflicted clan into a suburban everyfamily(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Bruce Almighty</title>
    <desc lang="en">After a bad day at work, a man suddenly gets a new job - as the world's new Heavenly Father - in this comedy. Bruce Nolan is a television reporter working in Buffalo, NY, who has been growing increasingly dissatisfied with his existence, and after an especially bad day, he flies into a rage and curses God for making his life miserable. To Bruce's great surprise, the Supreme Being Himself appears, and tries to convince Bruce of the enormity of his task. Bruce, however, isn't buying it, so God gives him a chance to find out what he's up against; God bestows all of his powers on Bruce for a week, to see how he'd handle things. At first, Bruce has a great time bending the world around him to his will, much to the puzzlement of his girlfriend, Grace (Jennifer Aniston), but after six days God stops by to remind Bruce he hasn't done much to make the Earth a better place. Disappointed, God presents Bruce with an ultimatum -- he has one day to improve the world in a concrete way, or God will toss the planet back into the void. Bruce Almighty was directed by Tom Shadyac, who previously teamed with Jim Carrey for Liar, Liar and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Le porno débauche-t-il nos ados ? Autrefois marginale et réservée à des publics avertis, la pornographie est aujourd'hui à la portée de n'importe quel internaute, quel que soit son âge. Nos jeunes, exposés plus que jamais à la pornographie, risquent-ils d'en devenir dépendants ? Comment perçoivent-ils ces images ? Quelles en sont les conséquences ? Leur vie sexuelle et affective en est-elle affectée ? Sont-ils aidés à décoder ce qui se cache derrière l'industrie du sexe ? Nous avons rencontré des ados connectés sur la toile, et nous sommes allés d'étonnement en surprise. Terminé le temps des magazines et vidéos. Désormais, Internet permet des relations sexuelles virtuelles très facilement, y compris via certains sites familiaux parmi les plus populaires. Notre enquête nous mènera à la rencontre de plusieurs ados qui ont depuis longtemps dépassé tous les tabous. Certains ont consommé du " X " dès l'âge de 8 ou 11 ans et en sont devenus accros. Existe-t-il un lien entre le cybersexe et la délinquance sexuelle ? Et qu'en est-il de l'éducation sexuelle dans nos établissements scolaire, au sein des familles ? Caméra à l'épaule, d'école en école, du secondaire jusqu'en maternelle, nous aborderons la question de l'éducation. Le bilan est loin d'être reluisant : aujourd'hui, dans les écoles en Communauté Française, un enfant sur deux ne bénéfice pas de réponses adéquates aux questions cruciales de la vie sexuelle et affective. Les parents esquivent, les enseignants sont démunis. Et pour ce qui est de l'éducation à l'image rien n'existe officiellement. Et les enfants ? Peut-on les protéger ? Comment ? Parler du cybersexe et de pornographie semble plus que jamais une nécessité, voire une urgence. Internet et Pornographie, faut-il leur tourner le dos ou les affronter de face ? / Internet : comment les pédophiles piègent-ils les enfants ? Chaque jour, des milliers de jeunes belges " chattent " sur des forums de discussions. Des dialogues bien souvent innocents. Mais la toile est aussi un véritable lieu de chasse pour les délinquants sexuels. Cette enquête dévoile de façon très claire comment des prédateurs chassent leurs jeunes victimes sur la toile. Plusieurs jeunes filles abusées témoignent. Une enquête étonnante, poignante(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Gulliver's Travels</title>
    <desc lang="en">Jack Black stars in this take on Jonathan Swift's 1726 novel, though director Rob Letterman's family-friendly version tones down the satire and concentrates just on Gulliver's early adventures. Lemuel Gulliver works in the post room of a New York newspaper. Spying an opportunity to impress the beautiful editor Darcy Silverman, he stoops to plagiarising travel websites in order to win a commission to write his own travel piece. He succeeds, but his reward is an assignment to the Bermuda Triangle, where he inevitably vanishes without trace. Gulliver wakes up on the shores of an island that's home to a nation of tiny people who appear to be stuck in the 18th century. And they aren't at all sure what to do with this gargantuan beast that Providence has washed up among them. The Lilliputian cast include Billy Connolly, Catherine Tate, Chris O'Dowd, Emily Blunt and James Corden(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Rushmore</title>
    <desc lang="en">After the highly acclaimed independent film Bottle Rocket, director Wes Anderson followed up with a quirky Touchstone Studios film entitled Rushmore. Written by Anderson and friend Owen Wilson (an actor in Armageddon and Anaconda), they created the story of Max Fischer, a highly eccentric 15-year-old boy who attends the tenth grade at Rushmore Academy. Played by Jason Schwartzman (Talia Shire's son and Francis Ford Coppola's nephew), Max is a poor student with big dreams and a love of extracurricular activities. Max is editor of the school newspaper and yearbook, president of the chess, astronomy, French, and German clubs, captain of the fencing team, and director of the school play. Max is also a compulsive liar, telling everyone that his barber father (Seymour Cassel) is really a brain surgeon. Suddenly Max falls in love with Miss Cross (Olivia Williams), a first-grade teacher at the school. He also makes a new friend in business tycoon Mr. Blume (Bill Murray), an eccentric millionaire who also loves Miss Cross. The love triangle heats up as Max refuses to believe that his age has anything to do with Miss Cross refusing his romantic advances. Also Max's scheme to erect an aquarium on the school baseball diamond gets him booted out of Rushmore Academy. As his life crumbles around him, he is forced to grow up and accept the consequences of his actions and his lies. He throws himself more into his extracurricular activities, hoping to redeem himself by staging the most ambitious school play ever attempted(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Fence</title>
    <desc lang="en">In October 2006, the United States government authorized the construction of a massive fence stretching seven hundred miles along the border separating the U.S. and Mexico. Proponents of the fence claimed that it would help prevent illegal immigration into the United States and foil drug smuggling. However, three years into the construction project, undocumented aliens are still streaming into America through communities divided by the fence, and drug traffic has not been significantly reduced. The fence also runs through a number of Mexican communities, dividing small towns and school campuses thanks to poor planning, and the construction has had a negative effect on the environment of previously unspoiled territories. The fence is ugly, impractical and ineffective -- so why is America still spending billions on dollars on completing a project that's a failure? Filmmaker Rory Kennedy examines the strange history and sometimes comical consequences of the border project in the documentary The Fence; produced for the premium cable network HBO, The Fence received its world premiere at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival(n)</desc>

Billy Bob Thornton stars (in a Golden Globe-nominated role) as Willie T. Stokes, a washed-up, wisecracking department store Santa who is only in the business for the criminal opportunities. Every Christmas Eve this Santa and his ingenious Elf' Willie's midget partner-in-crime Marcus (Tony Cox), crack the store safe and make off with their own holiday stash. But this year Santa and his Elf find their annual heist endangered by a pesky store manager (John Ritter), a savvy mall detective (Bernie Mac), a sexy Santa fan (Lauren Graham) and an 8-year-old misfit (Brett Kelly) who decides to believe that Willie: intoxicated, acid-tongued and felonious as he is, is the real Santa(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Rushmore</title>
    <desc lang="en">After the highly acclaimed independent film Bottle Rocket, director Wes Anderson followed up with a quirky Touchstone Studios film entitled Rushmore. Written by Anderson and friend Owen Wilson (an actor in Armageddon and Anaconda), they created the story of Max Fischer, a highly eccentric 15-year-old boy who attends the tenth grade at Rushmore Academy. Played by Jason Schwartzman (Talia Shire's son and Francis Ford Coppola's nephew), Max is a poor student with big dreams and a love of extracurricular activities. Max is editor of the school newspaper and yearbook, president of the chess, astronomy, French, and German clubs, captain of the fencing team, and director of the school play. Max is also a compulsive liar, telling everyone that his barber father (Seymour Cassel) is really a brain surgeon. Suddenly Max falls in love with Miss Cross (Olivia Williams), a first-grade teacher at the school. He also makes a new friend in business tycoon Mr. Blume (Bill Murray), an eccentric millionaire who also loves Miss Cross. The love triangle heats up as Max refuses to believe that his age has anything to do with Miss Cross refusing his romantic advances. Also Max's scheme to erect an aquarium on the school baseball diamond gets him booted out of Rushmore Academy. As his life crumbles around him, he is forced to grow up and accept the consequences of his actions and his lies. He throws himself more into his extracurricular activities, hoping to redeem himself by staging the most ambitious school play ever attempted(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Fence</title>
    <desc lang="en">In October 2006, the United States government authorized the construction of a massive fence stretching seven hundred miles along the border separating the U.S. and Mexico. Proponents of the fence claimed that it would help prevent illegal immigration into the United States and foil drug smuggling. However, three years into the construction project, undocumented aliens are still streaming into America through communities divided by the fence, and drug traffic has not been significantly reduced. The fence also runs through a number of Mexican communities, dividing small towns and school campuses thanks to poor planning, and the construction has had a negative effect on the environment of previously unspoiled territories. The fence is ugly, impractical and ineffective -- so why is America still spending billions on dollars on completing a project that's a failure? Filmmaker Rory Kennedy examines the strange history and sometimes comical consequences of the border project in the documentary The Fence; produced for the premium cable network HBO, The Fence received its world premiere at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A hilariously criminal Santa finds a measure of holiday redemption when he befriends a troubled kid. The traditional Christmas tale will never be the same after this cleverly twisted, merrily irreverent story of a Santa so bad that he's funny. Billy Bob Thornton stars (in a Golden Globe-nominated role) as Willie T. Stokes, a washed-up, wisecracking department store Santa who is only in the business for the criminal opportunities. Every Christmas Eve this Santa and his ingenious Elf' Willie's midget partner-in-crime Marcus (Tony Cox), crack the store safe and make off with their own holiday stash. But this year Santa and his Elf find their annual heist endangered by a pesky store manager (John Ritter), a savvy mall detective (Bernie Mac), a sexy Santa fan (Lauren Graham) and an 8-year-old misfit (Brett Kelly) who decides to believe that Willie: intoxicated, acid-tongued and felonious as he is, is the real Santa(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Ghost World</title>
    <desc lang="en">Filmmaker Terry Zwigoff, who enjoyed breakthrough success with his 1994 documentary Crumb, shifts gears as he examines the lives of two young women on the verge of leaving their adolescence behind in his first dramatic feature. Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) are two close friends who've just graduated from high school, and are trying to decide what to do with their lives. Enid is a dark-haired arch cynic who is tired of living at home with her ineffectual dad (Bob Balaban) and his annoyingly perky girlfriend Maxine (Teri Garr), while Rebecca is prettier and a bit cheerier, but no more certain about her future. While the two girls have vague plans of getting an apartment together, they seem content to while away their summer hanging out and indulging in their shared infatuation with Josh (Brad Renfro), a friend from school who works at a convenience store and doesn't seem to be especially attracted to either of them. Enid discovers that in order to get her diploma, she'll have to take an additional class over the summer, where she winds up studying art with Roberta (Illeana Douglas), who is determined to encourage Enid's creative impulses, whether Enid likes it or not. More significantly, Enid meets Seymour (Steve Buscemi), a geeky record collector more than twice her age, and while they would seem to have little in common (and Rebecca thinks he's a creep), Enid discovers a kindred spirit in fellow misfit Seymour, who shares her disgust with the world around them, and a relationship begins to develop between the two. Ghost World is based on the award-winning graphic novel by comic artist Daniel Clowes, who also wrote the film's screenplay(n)</desc>

So, did Reynolds fall for his college sweetheart Emily; the kooky apolitical friend April he met while working on the Bill Clinton campaign in 1992; or is she the ambitious, carefree journalist Summer?(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Ghost World</title>
    <desc lang="en">Filmmaker Terry Zwigoff, who enjoyed breakthrough success with his 1994 documentary Crumb, shifts gears as he examines the lives of two young women on the verge of leaving their adolescence behind in his first dramatic feature. Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) are two close friends who've just graduated from high school, and are trying to decide what to do with their lives. Enid is a dark-haired arch cynic who is tired of living at home with her ineffectual dad (Bob Balaban) and his annoyingly perky girlfriend Maxine (Teri Garr), while Rebecca is prettier and a bit cheerier, but no more certain about her future. While the two girls have vague plans of getting an apartment together, they seem content to while away their summer hanging out and indulging in their shared infatuation with Josh (Brad Renfro), a friend from school who works at a convenience store and doesn't seem to be especially attracted to either of them. Enid discovers that in order to get her diploma, she'll have to take an additional class over the summer, where she winds up studying art with Roberta (Illeana Douglas), who is determined to encourage Enid's creative impulses, whether Enid likes it or not. More significantly, Enid meets Seymour (Steve Buscemi), a geeky record collector more than twice her age, and while they would seem to have little in common (and Rebecca thinks he's a creep), Enid discovers a kindred spirit in fellow misfit Seymour, who shares her disgust with the world around them, and a relationship begins to develop between the two. Ghost World is based on the award-winning graphic novel by comic artist Daniel Clowes, who also wrote the film's screenplay(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Heartbreakers</title>
    <desc lang="en">After the little white lies of Romy and Michele's High School Reunion (1997), director David Mirkin focuses on scheming of a different sort in Heartbreakers. Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt play Max and Page Conners, a mother and daughter who share everything with each other: relationship advice, hair and makeup hints, and the money they win in costly divorce settlements with rich men. When the film opens, the Conners are putting the finishing touches on conning Dean (Ray Liotta), an auto-body shop owner. When the dust from that scam clears, Page announces she's ready to move away from her mother and set up shop on her own -- but in order to clear an outstanding debt, Max insists they bankrupt one more bachelor together. They settle upon phlegmatic Palm Springs widower William B. Tensy (Gene Hackman), a chain smoker with a heart of gold and a similarly bountiful bank account. Only two things stand in their way: Tensy's Teutonic caretaker Miss Madress (Nora Dunn) and beachfront bartender Jack (Jason Lee), a wry stargazer with whom Page becomes unexpectedly smitten. Heartbreakers is the third collaboration from writers Steven Mazur and Paul Guy, whose previous screwball comedy was 1997's international hit, Liar Liar(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Rushmore</title>
    <desc lang="en">After the highly acclaimed independent film Bottle Rocket, director Wes Anderson followed up with a quirky Touchstone Studios film entitled Rushmore. Written by Anderson and friend Owen Wilson (an actor in Armageddon and Anaconda), they created the story of Max Fischer, a highly eccentric 15-year-old boy who attends the tenth grade at Rushmore Academy. Played by Jason Schwartzman (Talia Shire's son and Francis Ford Coppola's nephew), Max is a poor student with big dreams and a love of extracurricular activities. Max is editor of the school newspaper and yearbook, president of the chess, astronomy, French, and German clubs, captain of the fencing team, and director of the school play. Max is also a compulsive liar, telling everyone that his barber father (Seymour Cassel) is really a brain surgeon. Suddenly Max falls in love with Miss Cross (Olivia Williams), a first-grade teacher at the school. He also makes a new friend in business tycoon Mr. Blume (Bill Murray), an eccentric millionaire who also loves Miss Cross. The love triangle heats up as Max refuses to believe that his age has anything to do with Miss Cross refusing his romantic advances. Also Max's scheme to erect an aquarium on the school baseball diamond gets him booted out of Rushmore Academy. As his life crumbles around him, he is forced to grow up and accept the consequences of his actions and his lies. He throws himself more into his extracurricular activities, hoping to redeem himself by staging the most ambitious school play ever attempted(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Two Brothers</title>
    <desc lang="en">Like The Bear, director Jean-Jacques Annaud's acclaimed animal picture released 15 years prior, Two Brothers offers a family-friendly epic as told through the eyes of its four-legged protagonists, who, in this case, are sibling tiger cubs Koumal and Sangha. Though a life in the jungles of French colonial Indochina circa the 1920s seemed certain, the cubs are separated shortly after their birth when the notorious hunter Aidan McRory (Guy Pearce) kills their father. Koumal is whisked away to a circus, where he is cruelly beaten into submission and forced to perform tricks to earn his keep. Sangha fares better at first -- he lands in the posh estate of a French government official who wants the big cat to serve as a companion for his lonely son, though a series of unforeseen circumstances ultimately finds Sangha in the hands of a man determined to turn him into an aggressive prizefighter. Understandably, neither tiger is happy with his arrangements, and both escape captivity in hopes of returning to the jungle. Unfortunately for them, the prospect of two loose tigers is hardly comforting for the locals, who quickly demand that McRory kill the cubs before they threaten the safety of the village. Once McRory finds the tigers in their natural habitat, however, he faces a crisis of conscience he hadn't thought possible. Two Brothers also features Jean-Claude Dreyfus and Freddie Highmore(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">August Rush</title>
    <desc lang="en">Kirsten Sheridan's family drama stars Freddie Highmore as Evan Taylor, a musical prodigy searching for his parents. When pregnant cellist Lyla Novacek was hit by a car, her controlling father and manager told her she'd lost the baby; in reality she gave birth prematurely and her father sent the infant to an orphanage. Eleven years later, when Evan finds out that his parents are alive, he sets out to find them, taking inspiration from the music around him. The heart of the film is Evan's almost mystical ability to 'feel' music, a challenging concept that is rendered believable thanks to inventive work from the composer of the main score, Mark Mancina. Also starring Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Evan's rock singer father, and Robin Williams as a modern-day Fagin who Evan meets during his search for his family(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">I Now Pronounce You Chuck &amp; Larry</title>
    <desc lang="en">When two testosterone-fueled firemen attempt to register as domestic partners in order to bypass the bureaucratic red tape preventing one of them from naming his own two children as his life-insurance beneficiaries, their low-key ruse turns into headline news in this quirky matrimonial comedy starring Adam Sandler and Kevin James. Chuck Levine (Sandler) and Larry Valentine (James) are two New York City firefighters whose longtime friendship has endured many a five-alarm fire. All that widower Larry wants is to ensure that his two children will be taken care of if anything should happen to him on the job, and all that single blaze-battler Chuck wants is to carry on with his carefree life of noncommitment. Having once rescued Larry from certain death in a particularly fearsome inferno, beholden Chuck feels forever indebted to his brave friend and has vowed to repay the favor when the time is right. When Larry discovers that the only means of circumventing the civic red tape that could throw his children's futures into jeopardy is to take Chuck as his lawfully wedded husband, his obligated pal reluctantly agrees to step up to the alter with the understanding that the arrangement will be a well-kept secret between themselves and the justice of the peace. A potentially fatal flaw in their presumably foolproof plan is soon revealed, however, when an overzealous bureaucrat decides to question Chuck and Larry's partnership. Subsequently forced to embark on a mandatory honeymoon and pose as starry-eyed newlyweds, Chuck and Larry quickly discover just how important it can be to stick by a friend in his or her time of need. Jessica Biel, Steve Buscemi, Ving Rhames, and Dan Aykroyd co-star in a comedy from The Benchwarmers director Dennis Dugan(n)</desc>

With mutilated bodies strewn about and murderous gang of monsters stalking them through an endless maze of corroded hallways, the only remaining hope for the frightened father and daughter now lies in the affected mind of a little girl who may understand more about the situation than anyone realizes(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Funnyman Robin Williams steps out of character in this tense, low-key thriller that marked the feature-film directorial debut of music video veteran Mark Romanek. Semour "Sy" Parrish (Williams) runs the photo processing department at a large discount store; Sy is dedicated to his job, and takes great pride in his work. Sy's favorite customers are Nina and Will Yorkin (Connie Nielsen and Michael Vartan), an attractive and cheerful young couple with a nine-year-old boy, Jake (Dylan Smith). Sy dotes on the Yorkins and their son whenever they drop off film to be processed -- something they've been doing quite often ever since Jake was born -- and Nina and Will are indulgent of Sy's attentions, regarding his as a harmless eccentric. What the Yorkins don't know is Sy is a desperately lonely man with no real life of his own, and he's been obsessively making copies of their photos, for years, imagining himself to be "Uncle Sy," a member of the family. Sy's tenuous hold on reality begins to collapse when he develops a roll of film brought in by a new customer that suggests Will has been unfaithful to Nina; the notion that his ideal family may be falling apart is troubling enough for Sy, and when he loses his job, Sy reaches the breaking point.

    <sub-title lang="en">Martin Shaw.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Inspector George Gently and The Professionals star Martin Shaw is the latest celebrity to go in search of his roots, and he's particularly interested in finding out more about his paternal grandfather Edwin, who was rarely spoken about by his family. The actor has only one photo of his ancestor, which shows him aged roughly 17 and wearing a military uniform. By zooming in on the picture, Martin's brother was able to identify their grandfather's badge, which suggests he was in the Royal Marines. Now, by meeting with a military historian, Martin tries to fill in the rest of the story, and in the process learns more about Edwin's role in defending Birmingham against German air assaults during the Second World War.(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Battle Royale</title>
    <desc lang="en">In a future where society is on the verge of collapse, the government takes drastic action against the problem of rebellious teenagers in this violent sci-fi opus from Japan. In the year 2002, Japan's economy has taken a dramatic turn for the worse, and massive unemployment and inflation have thrown most adults into a state of chaos; the nation's youth culture responds with unprecedented violence, delinquency, and truancy. Desperate to restore order, the Japanese parliament responds by creating the Millennial Reform School Act, in which groups of junior high students are selected at random, sent to an isolated island, and forced to play a rigorous war game, in which all but one of their number are killed. Kitano (Beat Takeshi) is an embittered school instructor who guides the 44 students of the Zentsuji Middle School's Class B through the deadly game known as "Battle Royale," as they struggle to survive against the elements and each other. Battle Royale proved to be both successful and highly controversial in Japan, where it set box-office records and prompted political leaders to call for stricter controls on violence in Japanese entertainment; the film was initially rated R-15 (no one under 15 admitted), unusual for violent films in Japan, though director Kinji Fukasaku later prepared a re-edited version that earned a more lenient classification(n)</desc>

The malevolent force known as The Krugen knows well that the owner of these objects will reap ultimate power, because by obtaining the magical mirror once owned by the Evil Queen who tormented Snow White, they were able to herald the arrival of the Dark Ages.

    <desc lang="en">Following memorable roles in the military action-adventures Pearl Harbor (2001) and Black Hawk Down (2001), young actor Josh Hartnett is propelled to romantic leading man status with this semi-autobiographical comedy from screenwriter Rob Perez. Hartnett stars as Matt Sullivan, a young man smarting over the bitter breakup of his most recent relationship. With Lent approaching, Matt decides to observe the 40-day tradition by abstaining from all sexual contact, including self-gratification. Once his odyssey of discipline has begun, he meets the girl of his dreams, while his ex begins campaigning to get him back. Co-starring Shannyn Sossamon, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Vinessa Shaw, 40 Days and 40 Nights inspired another round of controversy between distributor Miramax and the Catholic League, which accused the film of being a "vulgar parody" of Lent. The League previously protested the company's releases of Priest (1994) and Dogma (1999)(n)</desc>

When Peter learns that he must pay the bank $50,000 in 30 days, White is overjoyed: now he can have the parking lot his gym's always needed. But Peter decides to set up a money-earning dodgeball tournament (a sport that consists of not being hit by the opposing team's balls) to earn the dough and it is, of course, his team of misfits against White's tough pros in the final. Rawson Marshall Thurber's debut feature is a mix of verbal and physical humour and if the outcome is never in doubt, both Vaughn and particularly Stiller throw themselves into the film with enjoyable gusto(n)</desc>

But Peter decides to set up a money-earning dodgeball tournament (a sport that consists of not being hit by the opposing team's balls) to earn the dough and it is, of course, his team of misfits against White's tough pros in the final. Rawson Marshall Thurber's debut feature is a mix of verbal and physical humour and if the outcome is never in doubt, both Vaughn and particularly Stiller throw themselves into the film with enjoyable gusto(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In this drama that explores greed and corruption in American business, Giovanni Ribisi plays Seth Davis, an intelligent and ambitious college dropout who runs a casino in his apartment. Eager to show his father that he can succeed, Seth lands a job with a small stock brokerage firm. He is given a space in the company's "boiler room," where he makes cold calls to prospective clients. As it turns out, Seth has a genuine talent for cold calling, which gains him the approval of his superiors, the admiration of his father, and the attentions of one of his co-workers, Abby Hilliard (Nia Long). However, the higher up the ladder Seth rises, the deeper he sinks into a quagmire of dirty dealings, until he's breaking the law in order to keep his bosses happy and his paychecks coming. The Boiler Room also features Tom Everett Scott, Scott Caan, Jamie Kennedy, Nicky Katt, and Ben Affleck in a cameo as the headhunter who brings Seth into the firm. Ribisi and Scott also appeared together in That Thing You Do; Ribisi was the drummer replaced by Scott, who then led The One-Ders to fictional pop stardom(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</title>
    <desc lang="en">Terry Gilliam (Brazil, Twelve Monkeys, The Fisher King) directed this colorful, stylized, pseudo-psychedelic $21-million adaptation of the 1971 Hunter S. Thompson classic, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey into the Heart of the American Dream, about stoned sportswriter Raoul Duke, Thompson's alter ego, on a wild drug-crazed road trip, a paranoid plummet into the belly of the beast, with his pal, lawyer Oscar Zeta Acosta. Originally serialized in Rolling Stone (November 1971), the book catapulted Thompson headfirst toward the Kerouac-Mailer-Capote pantheon and jump-started the entire movement of "gonzo journalism." Carrying a suitcase of drugs, Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp with shaved pate) and his attorney Dr. Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro) drive a red convertible across the Mojave from L.A. to Vegas, where Duke has an assignment to cover the Mint 400 desert motorcycle race. As the drugs kick in, Duke ventures into voiceover, filling in the blank spots and narrative gaps. "This is not a good town for psychedelic drugs," says Duke, but even so, they consume vast quantities, eventually escalating to ether. Duke notes that with ether "you can actually watch yourself behaving this terrible way, but you can't control it." The two trash their hotel room, and Gonzo goes back to L.A. Thinking the hotel room holocaust will lead to an arrest, Duke begins a drive back to L.A., but after an odd encounter with a highway patrolman (Gary Busey) and a telephone conversation with Gonzo, he returns to Vegas to cover the District Attorney Convention on Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs in the glitzy Flamingo Hotel. This time the drugged-out duo trash their Flamingo room. The crazed carnival atmosphere segues into a carney casino, Bazooko's Circus, where a barker (Penn Jillette) spiels amid aerialists, clowns, and a rotating carousel bar. Gonzo worries over runaway teen Lucy (Christina Ricci), who paints portraits of Barbra Streisand. Soon the hallucinations begin: Duke sees Gonzo transmogrify into a demon with breasts on its back, and an acid vision of a Vegas bar features large legit lounge lizards (courtesy of monster makeup man Rob Bottin). Flashbacks depicting Duke's intro to the drug scene jump back to love-Haight relationships in San Francisco's Summer of Love. Cameos and guest stars include Mark Harmon, Cameron Diaz, Flea, Lyle Lovett, Harry Dean Stanton, Ellen Barkin, Tobey Maguire, and Hunter S. Thompson himself. The film features a Geffen Records soundtrack mixing rock of the period with Vegas lounge tunes. Over the years, various script adaptations came and went as did numerous talents; people connected with past efforts to film Thompson's book include Martin Scorsese, Jack Nicholson, Dan Aykroyd, John Belushi, and writer-director Alex Cox. Shown in competition at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival(n)</desc>

Samuel Falkner (Hugh Grant) is a child psychiatrist who has no kids of his own and doesn't want any, which leaves him a bit shaken when his girlfriend of five years, Rebecca Taylor (Julianne Moore) announces that she's pregnant. Suddenly, Samuel is plagued by paranoid fantasies about how marriage and fatherhood will change his life, which are not at all soothed by frequent visits from Rebecca's chronically-pregnant friend Gail Dwyer (Joan Cusack) and her half-bright lummox of a husband, Marty (Tom Arnold). Too selfish to deal with Rebecca's needs, Samuel parts company with her and takes a last stab at playing the field, but when he sees an ultrasound of his soon-to-be-born son, he decides that it's time to face his responsibilities before it's too late. Nine Months also features Robin Williams in a small role as Dr. Kosevich, an ob-gyn with a weak grasp of the English language(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Undercover Brother</title>
    <desc lang="en">Undercover Brother began life as an animated series on the Internet. The satirical cartoon was created by novelist and screenwriter John Ridley (Three Kings) for the website /urbanentertainment.com. Ridley wrote the screenplay with Michael McCullers, co-writer of the Austin Powers sequels, and it was directed by Malcolm D. Lee (Spike Lee's cousin, and the writer/director of The Best Man). The film stars Eddie Griffin (of TV's Malcolm and Eddie) as Undercover Brother, he of the gold Cadillac convertible and huge Afro, who uses gadgets and disguises to steal from the rich and give to the poor. His activities are discovered by the B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D., a spy organization devoted to subverting The Man (Robert Trumbull) and his henchman, Mr. Feather (Chris Kattan), who use their power over the media to demean black people and destroy racial unity. The spy organization is run by The Chief (Chi McBride), who is constantly screaming at his subordinates. They include Sistah Girl (Aunjanue Ellis), a beautiful martial artist, Conspiracy Brother (Dave Chappelle), who sees white supremacist plots everywhere, and Smart Brother (Gary Anthony Williams, who provided the voice of Undercover Brother in the cartoon), who supplies the operatives with gadgets and information. When a popular black political figure, General Boutwell (Billy Dee Williams), calls a press conference, presumably to announce his presidential candidacy, and instead announces that he's opening a chain of fried chicken restaurants, the B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D. rightly suspects foul play, and recruits Undercover Brother to look into it. He goes undercover as an uptight buppie to work for The Man, but his cover is soon blown, and the seductive White She Devil (Denise Richards) is sent in to use her feminine wiles to destroy Undercover Brother(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Slaughter</title>
    <desc lang="en">A typical gangland killing has an unusual outcome when the victim's son comes looking for justice in this violent blaxploitation action drama. Slaughter (Jim Brown) is a former Green Beret who is a decorated war hero, but while he's devoted his life to fighting for right, his father followed another path as a gangster. However, while Slaughter's dad was a career criminal, his mother played no part in his actions, and when they're both killed in a car explosion, Slaughter is determined to get revenge. Slaughter is convinced a rival crime boss ordered the bombing, and plans a daring raid where he kills the suspect. Slaughter is captured by police, and angry detective A.W. Price (Cameron Mitchell) tells Slaughter he had the right idea but the wrong man. Slaughter is persuaded to team up with undercover detectives Harry (Don Gordon) and Kim (Marlene Clark) as they travel to Puerto Rico in hopes of infiltrating the operations of hot-headed mobster Hoffo (Rip Torn). The cops have learned that Hoffo and his cronies are computerizing their operations and they're looking for hard evidence, but Slaughter is more interested in taking down Hoffo, and he'll do whatever it takes. The rivalry between Slaughter and Hoffo becomes all the more bitter when Slaughter becomes involved with Ann (Stella Stevens), the gangster's beautiful girlfriend. Featuring a dynamic theme song by Billy Preston, Slaughter was a major box-office hit in 1972 and one of the most popular films of Jim Brown's screen career; it spawned a sequel, Slaughter's Big Rip-Off, which appeared in 1973(n)</desc>

The first half concerns Brooklyn high-school student Chantel (Ariyan Johnson) as she deals with academic disagreements with her teachers (at one point getting into shouting match about the Holocaust), takes advantage of her boyfriend's wallet to go on a shopping spree, and confronts yuppies in the Upper West Side gourmet shop where she works.

    <desc lang="en">Comedian Eddie Griffin delivers a set of his outrageous standup comedy and introduces his fans to the family who helped inspire his work in this documentary. In DysFunKtional Family, Griffin talks about race, sex, cats, dogs, slavery, terrorism, Michael Jackson, and several of the more eccentric members of his family during a sold-out live show. In between bits, Griffin takes us on a tour of his home town of Kansas City, where we get to meet his mother, who has a remarkable enthusiasm for corporal punishment; his uncle, who discusses his remarkable enthusiasm for pornography; and another uncle, who proved to be an invaluable help to Griffin's early career despite his drug habit and career as a pimp. DysFunKtional Family was directed by George Gallo, who previously worked with Griffin on the comedy Double Take(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Final Season</title>
    <desc lang="en">A place where baseball is more than just a game fights to hold on to the national pastime in this drama inspired by a true story. Norway, IA, is a little town where folks take baseball seriously -- so much so that even though Norway's high school boasts less than a hundred students, their baseball team has brought home the state championship 19 times. Jim Van Scoyoc (Powers Boothe), Norway High's baseball coach, has received national attention for his skill with players, and when passionate baseball fan Kent Stock (Sean Astin) lands a teaching position nearby, he volunteers to work as an assistant for Van Scoyoc. While Stock cherishes his time with Van Scoyoc, he takes a job working in Saint Louis, where he plans to move with his fiancée. However, he changes his plans when he gets some unexpected news -- due to shrinking enrollment and budget cuts, Norway's high school is soon to close, and their upcoming baseball season is likely to be their last. Over the fierce objections of his girlfriend, Stock passes on the job in St. Louis to spend one last spring in Norway and help Van Scoyoc as he takes one last shot at taking his team to the state championship. Meanwhile, the citizens of Norway wage a legal battle to keep the school open, and the state sends a lawyer, Polly Hudson (Rachael Leigh Cook), to Norway to represent them. While Stock and Hudson are bitter enemies at the start of the season, with time she begins to understand the sense of tradition and love of the game that fuels Stock and the people of Norway. Also featuring Larry Miller, Tom Arnold, and Michael Angarano, The Final Season received its world premiere at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival(n)</desc>

Carlyle (Steve Howey) and his kid brother, Trip (Mike Vogel), are both racers in the rough and tumble world of supercross, a revved-up variation on motocross racing in which specially modified motorcycle negotiate specially built dirt tracks that send riders through tricky twists and turns, over rough terrain, and off high-flying jumps. Both are talented racers, but K.C. has a wilder and more reckless approach, while Trip follows a more cautious path. A more profound difference between them arises when K.C. is offered a lucrative deal to ride for a factory-sponsored team; he takes the deal, and leaves his brother behind to race on his own dime. However, when an accident takes Trip out of the running on the supercross circuit, he and K.C. set aside their differences as Trip helps coach his older brother so he can succeed in his drive to the championship. Made with the cooperation of a leading supercross race promoter, Supercross: The Movie also stars Sophia Bush and Cameron Richardson as the brothers' love interests, and Robert Carradine as a determined race coach(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Gabrielle Union, Morris Chestnut, Queen Latifah, and Terrence Howard star in a film concerning a young girl who implores a department-store Santa to find a new husband for her divorced mother for Christmas. Single mother of three Nancy (Union) has been putting the needs of her three children ahead of her own for as far back as she can remember, and lately her youngest daughter, Emily (Khail Bryant), has become acutely aware of her mother's palpable sadness. As Christmas draws near, Nancy takes her kids to the mall for a cheerful visit with jolly old Saint Nick. When it comes time for Emily's turn to sit on Santa's lap and make her Christmas wish, she selflessly remembers her mother's recent comment that a compliment from a man would be the best gift of all. Determined to make her mother happy again even if it means sacrificing her own wish, Emily relays the message to Santa (Chestnut), not realizing that the man beneath the beard is actually an office-supply salesman and ambitious singer/songwriter named Benjamin. Recognizing the daughter's love for her mother and sensing something truly special in Nancy, Benjamin cheerfully obliges the young girl, setting into motion a series of events that promise to make this the most memorable holiday in quite some time. Lance Rivera directs a film produced by Shakim Compere and Latifah through Flavor Unit Entertainment(n)</desc>

The two team up to form a travelling duo that perform an act, but the act is only known by themselves. Bowen supposedly 'slays' Draco and then collects a reward from the town or village that he protects by killing the dragon who had been 'terrorizing' them. From there, Bowen and Draco must save the entire kingdom from the rule of the now evil King Einon, who is part of Draco and Draco a part of him(n)</desc>

After casually ruining several lives, this Crangle declares that he has in his possession the means to shrink all evil people in the world to a height of two feet -- and that this metamorphosis will occur exactly at Four O'Clock. Appearing as Crangle's landlady is Moyna McGill, the actress mother of Angela Lansbury. "Four O'Clock" was first telecast on April 6, 1962(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Director Joe Johnston takes over the creative reins from Steven Spielberg for this third installment in the thriller franchise. Sam Neill returns as Dr. Alan Grant, a scientist who's tricked by wealthy couple Paul and Amanda Kirby (William H. Macy and Tea Leoni) into a fly-over of Isla Sorna. The object of their sightseeing tour is one of the Costa Rican islands populated by ferocious, genetically bred dinosaurs and the "site B" setting of Jurassic Park 2: The Lost World (1997). After their plane crash-lands, it's revealed that the Kirbys are actually seeking their teenage son, lost on the island after a paragliding accident. Trapped on Isla Sorna, Grant and his companions discover some painful truths the hard way. Among their discoveries: some of the scaly monsters possess more advanced communicative abilities than previously believed, the dreaded Tyrannosaurus Rex has a larger and more lethal competitor, and flying Pteranodons pose an even graver threat than some of their land-locked brethren. Jurassic Park III is the first in the series not to be based upon a novel by original author Michael Crichton(n)</desc>

In the premiere episode, Monica (Courteney Cox) is dancing on air after announcing her engagement to Chandler (Matthew Perry). But just as she is planning a champagne party to celebrate the occasion, Monica is taken aback at the spectacle of her brother, Ross (David Schwimmer), in the arms of Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) -- a coupling that was supposed to have been over and done with during the previous season. Convinced that Rachel is trying to "steal her thunder," Monica goes ballistic -- while Chandler begins to wonder if getting married is such a hot idea after all(n)</desc>

Meanwhile, Peg Bundy (Katey Sagal) wants only one, very simple Valentine's present: the words "I love you" from her boorish husband Al (Ed O'Neill). This is the famous "interactive" episode, in which viewers were invited to call in their votes as to whether or not Al should say, "I love you, Peg" or "Not tonight, Peg" (two 900 phone numbers were given out, with viewers paying 50 cents per call, the proceeds going to the American Heart Association). As originally telecast, the results of the voting were not revealed until one hour after Married... With Children signed off, during a telecast of another Fox sitcom, Duet -- and contrary to popular belief, only one version of the episode's finale was taped, rather than two alternates(n)</desc>

In the future, North America is no more. In its place has risen Panem, a divided nation split into 12 districts. Every year, each district selects a teen of each gender (called "Tributes") to test their worth in a competition known as the Hunger Games, which are broadcast across the nation as entertainment, and to reinforce the government's total power. When her younger sister is selected as District 12's latest "Tribute," Katniss volunteers to take her place, and trains under hard-drinking former Hunger Games champion Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) to sharpen her killer instincts. Now in order to survive the game and emerge the victor, this young combatant must put all of her skills to the ultimate test. Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth co-star(n)</desc>
