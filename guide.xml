    <title lang="en">Scent of a Woman</title>
    <desc lang="en">Driven by an extravagant, tour-de-force performance by Al Pacino, Scent of a Woman is the story of Frank Slade (Pacino), a blind, retired army colonel who hires Charlie Simms (Chris O'Donnell), a poor college student on the verge of expulsion, to take care of him over Thanksgiving weekend. At the beginning of the weekend, Frank takes Charlie to New York, where he reveals to the student that he intends to visit his family, have a few terrific meals, sleep with a beautiful woman and, finally, commit suicide. The film follows the mis-matched pair over the course of the weekend, as they learn about life through their series of adventures. Though the story is a little contrived and predictable, it pulls all the right strings, thanks to O'Donnell's sympathetic supporting role and Pacino's powerful lead performance, for which he won his first Academy Award. Scent of a Woman is based on the 1975 Italian film Profumo Di Donna(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">One of the first projects of syndicated TV producer Steve Rotfield, the weekly half-hour Wild About Animals was hosted by actress Mariette Hartley. The series cast its spotlight on rare animals, unique to specific regions of the United States. Regular weekly features included "K9 Cops and Animal Heroes," "Celebrity Owners," and "Animal Bloopers." First telecast in the fall of 1995, Wild About Animals was still flourishing at the end of the 20th century, by which time it was being shown in tandem with two other Rotfield efforts, The Lighter Side of Sports and Awesome Adventures, in most local markets(n)</desc>

Documentary telling the full story of World War II with the aid of rare and unseen archive footage, recently released official documents, modern colourisation techniques, state-of-the-art satellite-delivered terrain mapping and graphics. In the run-up to September 1939, political and economic chaos in the aftermath of World War I allowed Hitler in Germany, Mussolini in Italy and ultra-nationalists in imperial Japan to seize absolute power. When Britain, France and the United States failed to confront initial acts of aggression, contempt for their weakness prompted Germany and Italy to intervene in the civil war in Spain and Hitler to make a series of land grabs which brought Europe to the brink of war. Ep. 1 (Followed by News)(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">Imagine - Mapplethorpe.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato present an uncompromising portrait of controversial American photographer Robert Mapplethorpe. Based in New York, Mapplethorpe continually challenged the limits of acceptability via large-scale, highly stylised portraits of typically taboo subjects. His tendency to flirt with obscenity dominated his work until his death in 1989, and as the images he produced gained notoriety, he was posthumously denounced by conservative US senator Jesse Helms, who urged Congressmen to `look at the pictures' he had produced in his lifetime and decide for themselves whether they were suitable for public consumption. Here, Bailey and Barbato explain how Mapplethorpe's artistic flair was not only fuelled by what is now considered to be his genius eye, but also by his insatiable desire for celebrity.(n)</desc>

The job fits perfectly with uber-slacker Wheeler's rock'n'roll lifestyle, while cynical Danny, whose focus is his girlfriend Beth, feels underused and that his life is dribbling away.

They choose the latter, becoming mentors to a 10-year-old breast-obsessed lad called Ronnie and teenage role-play gamer Augie. It's difficult to tell whose behaviour is worse, the children or the 'adults', but a battle of wills ensues, which will have a meaningful outcome for each of the quartet..(n)</desc>

The job fits perfectly with uber-slacker Wheeler's rock'n'roll lifestyle, while cynical Danny, whose focus is his girlfriend Beth, feels underused and that his life is dribbling away. However, neither men can find the motivation to grab life by the scruff - until, one day, they crash their truck and are given the choice between jail or community service. They choose the latter, becoming mentors to a 10-year-old breast-obsessed lad called Ronnie and teenage role-play gamer Augie. It's difficult to tell whose behaviour is worse, the children or the 'adults', but a battle of wills ensues, which will have a meaningful outcome for each of the quartet..(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Who Killed the Candy Heiress? The Helen Brach Story. A troubled conman's past catches up to him in the A&amp;E documentary American Justice: Who Killed the Candy Heiress -- Helen Bach. When millionairess Helen Brach disappeared in 1977, her absence wasn't noticed for two weeks. A fan of the horse races, Brach spent her time at the stables with her prize-winning breeds. The police were baffled by the case and came up with no suspects for 20 years. Then, in 1995, a list was compiled while working on the capture of an ill-willed ladies man named Richard Bailey which piqued the interest of detectives. Turns out Bailey was a costly habit for rich women. Prosecutors' suppositions were so strong that Bailey was convicted of the plot and sentenced to life in prison. Through interviews and footage, A&amp;E reconstructs the case of the missing millionaire(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Presenters Ellie Harrison and Max Hug Williams follow orphaned baby animals as they make steps to return to the wild. Ellie travels to Australia to meet three koalas called Tilly, Puddles and Danny, who were rescued from the roadside where their mother had been killed - Danny needs around-the-clock care and is building up his strength with night-time games of chase. She also meets a tiny wallaby called Neil, whose carer Stella is worried may die from stress if they can't find him a companion. Elsewhere, wildlife cameraman Max is in Costa Rica where he gets acquainted with Newbie, a five-month-old three-toed sloth who has suffered from pneumonia since she was rescued. He follows wildlife manager Sam at Kids Saving the Rainforest as she tries to teach the baby sloth to climb trees and learn to go back to the wild.(n)</desc>

    <sub-title lang="en">The Journey.</sub-title>
    <desc lang="en">David Tennant narrates an insight into this most intriguing and comical of birds, beginning with three different species' journeys to reach their breeding grounds. Emperor penguins cross a treacherous frozen sea, and rockhoppers brave stormy seas before they come ashore and face a daunting assault up a 300ft cliff, where they are vulnerable to predators. Meanwhile, the tropical humboldts have to evade sea lions, dodge vampire bats and battle sea birds before they can lay their eggs in the desert. All the while, their every move is being secretly filmed by hidden spy technology, including robotic penguins with cameras for eyes.(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A domesticated grizzly bear finds that there's more to life than being the star attraction of a mountain town nature show when a fast-talking mule deer offers him a crash course in woodland living in Sony Pictures Animation's first full-length animated feature. Raised by kindly park ranger Beth (Debra Messing) since he was a just a cub, 900-pound grizzly Boog (Martin Lawrence) is content to spend his days entertaining Timberline tourists and his nights nestled safely in Beth's luxurious garage. Boog's life is about to get much more complicated, however, when paranoid hunter Shaw (Gary Sinese) returns from a recent foray in the woods with a frightened, one-horn mule deer named Elliot strapped trophy-like to the hood of his truck. Though at first reluctant to answer Elliot's desperate cries for help, gentle giant Boog eventually frees the thankful creature, who in turn decides to teach his hulking friend what it truly means to be free. Subsequently tranquilized and relocated into the wilderness after momentarily reverting to his true animalistic nature, Boog is forced to team with seasoned forest-dweller Elliot in order to find their way out of the woods before hunting season starts and Shaw comes gunning for all creatures great and small. Things are different in the woods than they were back in the safe confines of park ranger Beth's garage, though, and in order to find their way back to Timberline, Boog and Elliot are going to have to rely on the kindness of their fellow creatures, a rowdy and unruly bunch that includes an army of Scottish squirrels led by rogue critter McSquizzy (Billy Connolly), and a productive beaver construction team whose foreman, Reilly (Jon Faverau), is more than willing to lend a helping tail. With hunting season now upon them and time running out as the hunters close in, the unlikely duo of bear and mule deer put their new life lessons to good use by turning the tables on the gun-toting gamesmen, and once again making the woods safe for the furry critters who call the forest home(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Based on the 1997 National Book Award-nominated novel of the same name by Diane Johnson (co-writer of the script for Stanley Kubrick's The Shining), Le Divorce is a romantic comedy from director James Ivory. Revisiting the "Americans in France" theme that Ivory explored in 1998's A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries, the film stars Kate Hudson as Isabel Walker. When she receives word that her pregnant poetess sister Roxy (Naomi Watts) has been left by her philandering French husband, artist Charles-Henri de Persand (Melvil Poupaud), Isabel offers her help and moral support. As the depressive Roxy struggles with the separation proceedings -- which include the rights to ownership of a work of art that's a family heirloom -- Isabel takes a job with author Olivia Pace and has a fling with the bohemian Yves (Romain Duris). But things get complicated when the younger, more impudent sister decides instead to pursue Charles' uncle, the snooty, married diplomat Edgar (Thierry Lhermitte), and when a mysterious man (Matthew Modine) starts stalking Roxy. Eventually, the rest of the plucky Walker clan has to come to the aid of the siblings. Stockard Channing and Sam Waterston co-star(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Le Divorce</title>
    <desc lang="en">Based on the 1997 National Book Award-nominated novel of the same name by Diane Johnson (co-writer of the script for Stanley Kubrick's The Shining), Le Divorce is a romantic comedy from director James Ivory. Revisiting the "Americans in France" theme that Ivory explored in 1998's A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries, the film stars Kate Hudson as Isabel Walker. When she receives word that her pregnant poetess sister Roxy (Naomi Watts) has been left by her philandering French husband, artist Charles-Henri de Persand (Melvil Poupaud), Isabel offers her help and moral support. As the depressive Roxy struggles with the separation proceedings -- which include the rights to ownership of a work of art that's a family heirloom -- Isabel takes a job with author Olivia Pace and has a fling with the bohemian Yves (Romain Duris). But things get complicated when the younger, more impudent sister decides instead to pursue Charles' uncle, the snooty, married diplomat Edgar (Thierry Lhermitte), and when a mysterious man (Matthew Modine) starts stalking Roxy. Eventually, the rest of the plucky Walker clan has to come to the aid of the siblings. Stockard Channing and Sam Waterston co-star(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Formula 51</title>
    <desc lang="en">First-time screenwriter Stelios Pavlou enjoyed a major success with this script that he wrote while working in an English liquor store by sending it to actor Samuel L. Jackson, who signed on for one of the lead roles. Jackson is Elmo McElroy, a kilt-wearing, golf club-wielding Los Angeles native who has invented an illegal drug formula that he hopes will provide him with a last major score of 20 million dollars before he retires from a life of crime. He travels to Liverpool, England, where he hopes to find a buyer for his creation among the denizens of the city's rave scene, but his plans go awry when those who are in on the deal start turning up dead. Elmo's only protector is a chain-smoking, Yank-hating local hood named Felix De Souza (Robert Carlyle), who reluctantly partners with the violence-prone American to finish the deal and cash in, sparking a gang war between Elmo's vengeful one-time employer, The Lizard (Meat Loaf); Felix's boss, Durant (Ricky Tomlinson); crooked cop Virgil Kane (Sean Pertwee); a beautiful assassin, who also happens to be Felix's ex-girlfriend (Emily Mortimer); and an offbeat, yoga-practicing nightclub owner and mobster named Iki (Rhys Ifans). For its U.S. release, the title of The 51st State was changed to Formula 51(n)</desc>

Jackson, who signed on for one of the lead roles. Jackson is Elmo McElroy, a kilt-wearing, golf club-wielding Los Angeles native who has invented an illegal drug formula that he hopes will provide him with a last major score of 20 million dollars before he retires from a life of crime. He travels to Liverpool, England, where he hopes to find a buyer for his creation among the denizens of the city's rave scene, but his plans go awry when those who are in on the deal start turning up dead. Elmo's only protector is a chain-smoking, Yank-hating local hood named Felix De Souza (Robert Carlyle), who reluctantly partners with the violence-prone American to finish the deal and cash in, sparking a gang war between Elmo's vengeful one-time employer, The Lizard (Meat Loaf); Felix's boss, Durant (Ricky Tomlinson); crooked cop Virgil Kane (Sean Pertwee); a beautiful assassin, who also happens to be Felix's ex-girlfriend (Emily Mortimer); and an offbeat, yoga-practicing nightclub owner and mobster named Iki (Rhys Ifans). For its U.S. release, the title of The 51st State was changed to Formula 51(n)</desc>

But the host of the show, Prem Kumar is convinced he's cheating and hands him over to the police to beat the truth out of him.

But he discovers his new property is slightly unusual: he now owns a team of sled dogs. It turns out his mother was an Alaskan sled-racing champion! Another shock awaits Ted in the frozen wastes: his real dad is a grumpy old white man who's only interested in Ted's dogs. The fun comes as thick and fast as a blizzard when Ted decides to gain his dad's respect by defending his mother's title. The only trouble is, he's never raced sled dogs in his life... Two Oscar winners come together in this hilarious movie, as Cuba Gooding Jr plays the dentist who spends a lot of his time up to his waist in snow, while James Coburn is his father, who's out to get his son's inheritance. Laughter comes in flurries as Gooding proves how cool he is, in a very different way from his normal roles!(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This was the third follow-up to Tim Burton's Batman (1989), the original revisionist look at the Gotham City legend, as well as the second in the Batman series directed by Joel Schumacher and the first featuring George Clooney as the Caped Crusader; it features not one but two super-villains, and a new heroine to fight crime alongside Bruce Wayne (aka Batman) and Dick Grayson (aka Robin) (Chris O'Donnell). The experiments of Dr. Victor Fries (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to preserve his late wife cryogenically have gone horribly wrong, turning him into the evil genius Mr. Freeze, who must keep his body at sub-zero temperature in order to say alive -- and he wants to put Gotham City on ice. Shy horticulturist Pamela Isley (Uma Thurman) goes a bit wild with a Venus Fly Trap-like creation she's been working on and mutates into Poison Ivy, who wants to kill all the people on Earth so plants can take over. Can Batman and Robin stop these fiends before their plans go too far? Meanwhile, Bruce and Dick's faithful butler Alfred (Michael Gough) isn't feeling well, so his niece Barbara (Alicia Silverstone) comes to pay a visit. When Barbara finds out what her uncle's employers do in their spare time, she decides she wants in on the action, and she joins the crime fighting twosome as Batgirl. Batman &amp; Robin also features Jesse Ventura in a small role as a prison guard; it would be his last film role before becoming Governor of Minnesota in 1998(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Born on the Fourth of July</title>
    <desc lang="en">The second of three films by co-writer/director Oliver Stone to explore the effects of the Vietnam War (Platoon and Heaven and Earth are the others), Born On The Fourth Of July tells the true story of Ron Kovic (Tom Cruise), a patriotic, All-American small town athlete who shocks his family by enlisting with the Marines to fight in the Vietnam War. Once he is overseas, however, Kovic's gung-ho enthusiasm turns to horror and confusion when he accidentally kills one of his own men in a firefight. His downfall is furthered by a bullet wound that leaves him paralyzed from the chest down. He returns home, spends an appalling, nightmarish stint in a veterans' hospital, and follows an increasingly disillusioned and fragmented path that ultimately leaves him drunk and dissolute in Mexico. However, Kovic somehow turns himself around and pulls his life together, becoming an outspoken anti-war activist in the process. The film is long but emotionally powerful; many consider it Stone's best work and Cruise's best performance. Both were nominated for Oscars, as was the film itself, but only Stone, who co-wrote the film with Kovic from the latter's book, won for Best Director(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The Ark of the Covenant, the sacred container housing the stone tablets on which Moses inscribed the Ten Commandments, has inspired intrepid quests since it disappeared over 2,500 years ago. Hollywood's Indiana Jones grappled with Nazis to capture the Ark, which is believed to possess incredible destructive powers. And for the last 20 years a real-life adventurer, Professor Tudor Parfitt, has been searching for the last resting place of the Ark. Inspired by ancient documents and codes in Oxford and Jerusalem, the quest has taken Parfitt, a Professor of Modern Jewish Studies at London's prestigious School of Oriental and African Studies, on an incredible journey across the Middle East, Arabia and Africa. And now, controversially, he believes he can finally answer the riddle of the Ark and reveal its location. But the Professor is overwhelmed when he finally comes face-to-face with the ancient artefact that he believes to be the Ark, in the last place he expects to find it and looked after by people who have no idea of the significance of their possession. His theory is built upon incredible DNA research that reveals a lost tribe of Israel, and his research asks major question about what the Ark really was(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Kick-Ass</title>
    <desc lang="en">Adapted from Mark Millar's hyper-violent comic book of the same name, director Matthew Vaughn's (Layer Cake) vigilante superhero film tells the tale of an average New York teenager who decides to don a costume and fight crime. Comic book geek Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) may not have good coordination or special powers, but that doesn't mean he isn't a fully capable crime fighter. After purchasing a flashy wet suit on the Internet, Dave starts busting up baddies with nothing but brute force. He calls himself Kick-Ass, and he can take a beating as good as he can dish one out. Before long, Kick-Ass has become a local sensation, and others are following his lead. Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) are a father-daughter crime-fighting duo who have set their sights on local mob heavy Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong). They're doing a decent job of dismantling Frank's sizable underworld empire when Kick-Ass gets drawn into the fray. But Frank's men play rough, and his son, Chris (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), is about to become Kick-Ass' very first arch nemesis. When Chris assumes the persona of Red Mist, the stage is set for a superhero showdown that could spell the end of Kick-Ass once and for all(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A laid-back health inspector's comfortable routine receives an unwelcome shake up when he's assigned the task of training his new rookie partner and investigating the outbreak of a mysterious illness at one of the city's most posh restraints in this no-holds-barred comedy starring Blue Collar standup king Larry the Cable Guy. It's all greasy spoons and low-rent ethnic eateries in the world of seasoned big-city health inspector Larry (Larry the Cable Guy), and that's just the way he likes it. After begrudgingly accepting the task of training by-the-books trainee Amy (Iris Bahr), Larry lands the biggest case of his career when a group of high-class diners fall ill following a particularly pricey meal. Though the gruff but lovable health inspector soon loses his job as a direct result of his questionable manners, he soon wins the heart of a shy waitress while attempting to go undercover to crack the case and ensure that the conspirators who engineered the poisonous plan are brought to justice(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Sting</title>
    <desc lang="en">Four years after setting box offices ablaze in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Paul Newman, Robert Redford, and director George Roy Hill re-teamed with similar success for The Sting. Redford plays Depression-era confidence trickster Johnny Hooker, whose friend and mentor Luther Coleman (Robert Earl Jones) is murdered by racketeer/gambler Doyle Lonnegan (Robert Shaw). Hoping to avenge Luther's death, Johnny begins planning a "sting" -- an elaborate scam -- to destroy Lonnegan. He enlists the aid of "the greatest con artist of them all," Henry Gondorff (Paul Newman), who pulls himself out of a drunken stupor and rises to the occasion. Hooker and Gondorff gather together an impressive array of con men, all of whom despise Lonnegan and wish to settle accounts on behalf of Luther. The twists and surprises that follow are too complex to relate in detail -- suffice to say that you can't cheat an honest man, and that you shouldn't accept everything at face value. The Sting became one of the biggest hits of the early '70s; grossing 68.5 million dollars during its first run, the film also picked up seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, and Best Adapted Score for Marvin Hamlisch's unforgettable setting of Scott Joplin's ragtime music(n)</desc>

Things take a turn for the worse when the dead return to stake their claim on the Earth, and though the chaos that follows threatens to swallow up all of England, it's up to Shaun to keep his cool and prove himself once and for all by successfully rescuing Liz and his mother. With his trusty roommate by his side, nothing -- not even the living dead -- can stand between Shaun and the two most important women in his life(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Ice Storm</title>
    <desc lang="en">Ang Lee's haunting drama won the Best Screenplay award in Cannes and was a hit with the critics for its powerful evocation of the listless decadence that characterised the closing years of the '70s. Starring Kevin Kline and Sigourney Weaver, the film is set against the backdrop of a small Connecticut town shrouded in winter in the dark days of Watergate. The parallel experiences of the adults and children of one family are shown as they experiment with sex and drugs in an increasingly desperate attempt to create meaning in their shallow, bourgeois lives, unaware that a storm is fast approaching(n)</desc>

Anthony "Swoff" Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) decides to join the Marines, just like his father and his father before him, and signs on just in time to be sent to Iraq to fight in the Gulf War in 1991. After experiencing the rigors of boot camp, Swofford and his pal Troy (Peter Sarsgaard) are trained to be snipers, and under the leadership of Sgt. Sykes (Jamie Foxx) and Lt. Col. Kazinski (Chris Cooper), the two land in the middle of a desert where they're up against an enemy they can't always see under a blazing sun with hours of boredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror. Swofford, Troy, and their fellow soldiers rely on the wits, their sense of humor, and their friendship of their brothers in arms to deal with a situation that doesn't much resemble what they saw on television at home. Jarhead was based on the memoirs of the real-life Anthony Swofford, who did serve as a sniper in the 1991 Gulf War; the title comes from military slang for a Marine enlistee(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Flicka</title>
    <desc lang="en">A young woman pins her hopes and dreams on a maverick horse in this drama based on the classic novel by Mary O'Hara. Katy (Alison Lohman) is the teenage daughter of a horse rancher (Tim McGraw) who is grooming his son to take over the family business, while Katy is sent to an exclusive private school where she feels like a misfit. One day, while out riding, Katy finds a wild horse, a beautiful black mustang, and she feels an emotional connection with the animal. While her father is convinced having a mustang around his herd will be bad for both his thoroughbred ponies and the wild horse, Katy is certain she can break the strong-willed steed and make him a champion, and she even gives the horse a name -- Flicka. As Katy struggles to tame the headstrong Flicka, she also tries to prove to her father that she knows horses as well as he does, and that she's every bit as capable of running the ranch as her brother. Also starring Maria Bello and Ryan Kwanten, Flicka was previously adapted for the screen as My Friend Flicka in 1943(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Andy Tennant's romantic comedy fantasy is set in 16th-century France, where, following the death of her father, Danielle De Barbarac is assigned kitchen duties in the castle by her stepmother Baroness Rodmilla de Ghent. A chance meeting with Prince Henry, heir apparent to the throne, leads to the potential for a romance that she fears could be ruined if he discovers the masquerade. A "fairy godmother" in the shape of Leonardo da Vinci eventually smoothes the path of true love but, thanks to Barrymore, this is not another soft retelling of Cinderella but a punchy, energetic film with Barrymore in excellent form as the forthright Danielle(n)</desc>

One the finest of all Twilight Zone episodes, "Walking Distance" benefits not only from a superb Rod Serling script and a magnificent starring performance by Gig Young, but also from an evocative musical score by Bernard Herrmann (which would be cannibalized many times on subsequent episodes). Young is cast as 35-year-old businessman Martin Sloan, who, while waiting for his car to be repaired, takes a sentimental journey to his home town of Homewood. Gradually, Martin begins to realize that the town has not changed one bit in 25 years: In fact, his parents are still alive, and there's a young boy running around who is the living image of 10-year-old Martin Sloan. Watch for Ron Howard in a three-line bit role. "Walking Distance" was first telecast October 30, 1959(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A genetically altered super-weapon embarks on a nightmare rampage of chaos and carnage in this campy tale of terror in the water from legendary producer Roger Corman. "S-11" was created to be the most powerful weapon in the U.S. Navy's arsenal. A horrifying hybrid of shark and octopus, it strikes with lightning speed, and incredible precision. But all hell breaks loose when the creature's creator, Genetic Scientist Nathan Sands (Eric Roberts) follows orders to stage an impromptu demonstration for his government contact, and the control device that controls the leviathan is irreparably damaged. Now free to swim the ocean and attack at will, "S-11" makes way for Puerto Vallarta and decides to turn the tables on the local sea-food lovers. With no time to lose as the uncontrollable abomination emerges from the sea to feast on terrified beachcombers, Nathan's brilliant daughter Nicole (Sara Malakul Lane) enlists the help of a hard-drinking mercenary, a fearless investigative reporter, and her easily-rattled cameraman to destroy the most powerful weapon in the history of modern warfare(n)</desc>

    <title lang="en">Money Talks</title>
    <desc lang="en">Essentially a showcase for the talents of squeaky-voiced comedian Chris Tucker, who has been compared to a young Eddie Murphy by fans, and to fingernails on a chalkboard by detractors, this action-comedy centers on the unlikely friendship that develops between a fast-talking petty con-artist and a has-been newscaster who is trying to resurrect his career and marry a young noveau-riche debutante. Though strictly small potatoes, scam-man Franklin Hatchett (Tucker) attracts the attention of the TV anchorman James Russell (Charlie Sheen) while running his latest con at a carwash. Shortly after refusing an interview with Russell, Franklin ends up jailed. He manages to escape when a transfer bus is hijacked. Handcuffed to a French jewel thief involved in the attack, Franklin is dragged along. He escapes, but his troubles are not over, for he quickly learns that he is the accused perpetrator of the hijacking. When all is said and done, Franklin finds himself pursued by the cops, the thieves, loan sharks, and an irate pregnant girlfriend. In desperation he goes to Russell and makes a deal. Russell brings Franklin to his pre-wedding party to meet his fiance Grace Ciprani (Heather Locklear). Franklin creates big trouble when he tells her father Guy (Paul Sorvino) that he is Vic Damone, Jr., son of Vic Damone and Diahann Carroll. Guy accepts this and gives Franklin a real Italian welcome. But though he may feel safe for the moment, Franklin's troubles are just beginning and before the story ends, he and the hapless Russell are involved in gun fights, car chases and a final showdown at the Los Angeles Coliseum(n)</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The One with Two Parts. This episode marks the first appearance of Phoebe's (Lisa Kudrow) twin sister, Ursula (also played by Kudrow), who is the exact opposite of the considerate and peace-loving Phoebe. Joey starts to date Ursula, which annoys Phoebe because she doesn't get along with her sister. Meanwhile, Ross (David Schwimmer) attends Lamaze class with Susan (Jessica Hecht) and Carol (Jane Sibbett). As Carol voices her anxiety about going through with the pregnancy, Ross also begins to come to terms with his role as a father; much humor is made over who gets to play the father role in the class exercises. Across town, Chandler (Matthew Perry) is dating Nina (Jennifer Grant), an employee he cannot bring himself to fire -- instead, he tells the other office workers that she is insane and too imbalanced to let go. When Nina asks why her co-workers are avoiding her, Chandler says that perhaps they are jealous of their relationship. After Marcel, Ross' monkey, changes Monica's (Courteney Cox) TV to Spanish mode, the gang sits around and watches it. This leads Joey to make the astute observation that "Urkel" is spelled the same way in Spanish as it is in English. Helen Hunt and Leila Kenzle show up at Central Perk as Jamie and Fran, their characters from Mad About You. This episode is part one of a two-part episode that originally aired on February 23, 1995(n)</desc>
